<PARA>This is a procedural motion only. Last week I tabled the report proposing that the name of the Joint Committee on the ACT be changed to the Joint Committee on the National Capital. The reason for the proposal is that the Committee, which has been a watchdog for the Federal Parliament on the detailed planning of the ACT, no longer has a lot of those responsibilities now the ACT has self-government&mdash;the Committee's responsibilities relate only to the national capital functions&mdash;and, therefore, a change of name more accurately reflects the change in the Committee's role. It also might help clarify that role in the minds of the people  of the ACT. The proposal has the unanimous support of the Committee and also the support of the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin). I urge that the report be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I rise to speak on the report tabled on behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I understand other members of the Committee will be participating in this debate a little later on. The Committee's task in undertaking this particular inquiry was to examine the corporate practices which predominated in Australia during the late 1980s and specifically to determine whether the existing legislative controls over the operation of Australian corporations adequately protected the rights of shareholders. Mostly, the Committee was concerned with the operation of listed companies, that is, those listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. In terms of shareholders, we were mostly concerned with small non-institutional shareholders. In conducting this inquiry, however, the Committee was keen to make sure that we were not simply looking for scapegoats, but rather that our examination would lead to a series of recommendations which would improve the standard of corporate behaviour in Australia while at the same time not putting undue burden on the operation of the Australian business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were principally interested in the role of small non-institutional shareholders, it is, of course, interesting to note that Australia has not traditionally been a nation of shareholders. The proportion of Australians who hold shares in our listed companies is relatively small by international standards. Certainly, it is much less than that of the United States and of similar countries in Europe. I suppose the flip side of that is that institutional shareholders have always been major players in the Australian market and that trend is continuing. Indeed, as we move towards the next century, we could see that Australian shareholders would have their interests in the share markets looked at almost entirely by large institutions such as superannuation funds. It is unlikely that we will see large numbers of small Australian shareholders. This may change. There are, I suppose, some trends moving against that. One would be the move towards privatisation of government assets. Certainly, with the partial float of the Commonwealth Bank, there was a large number of small shareholders in that particular venture. However, if the experience of privatisation is any guide, it is quite possible that even over time the float of government assets will still lead to larger concentrations of shares in a smaller number of hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I note that the Committee was concerned to make sure that the market did operate effectively and that shareholders could hold interests with some sort of level of confidence. Even though big players, as such, may be able to look after themselves, it is still no consolation to small shareholders if they find themselves completely at the mercy of unscrupulous company directors, company officers, or at the hands of auditors and the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the experience of the 1980s, there have, of course, been some significant changes which again this Committee's report has to be considered in the light of. The most important of those has been the move towards a truly national system of company regulation through the Australian Securities Commission, this national system replacing the State system. I think that it was fairly held by the Committee to be the most significant reform that could be undertaken to improve the operation of the Australian business system. Coupled with that has been the significant increase in resources available to the Australian Securities Commission when compared with its predecessor. Those two factors alone, having a national system and having that national system adequately resourced, will probably do far more to improve corporate behaviour in Australia than any reconsideration of the operation of the legal system or any change in a raft of laws. Notwithstanding those changes, the Committee did examine the role of the major players, that is, the Australian Securities Commission, the Australian Stock Exchange and the other major contributors to a secure corporate system, the accounting profession, particularly auditors, and shareholders themselves, in the area of self-help; what remedies were there for shareholders to protect their own interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's major recommendation on this was that there should be a system whereby shareholders can effectively look after themselves. The major reform advanced by the Committee was the virtual abolition of the old rule in the case of Foss v. Harbottle. This rule effectively precludes individual shareholders from challenging decisions made by the directors, except in a specified number of exemptions. This rule, even though it has been watered down over the years by the interpretation of the courts, does prove to be an effective bar against shareholders challenging the actions of directors. When one combines that with the excessive cost of attempting to take actions, one can see that the position of smaller shareholders is indeed very stark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the most telling example brought to the Committee of the position of individual shareholders was the position of shareholders in the IRL group. I note that certain directors of that group of companies are now subject to charges before the courts. I will not canvass the particular issues involving those directors except to say that things only got to that stage due to the very determined effort of a group of shareholders, a couple of whom fortunately had the financial resources to pursue it. Those particular shareholders must have expended sums in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to pursue court remedies to try to bring into line the actions of the directors of that particular group of companies. Only if we can make shareholders' remedies more effective can shareholders have some confidence in the concept of self-help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation in this regard was the adoption of a system which has been trialled in Canada known as derivative actions. The basis of this is to allow the individual shareholder to take action against company officers and have recourse, once a prima facie case is established, to the resources of the company in order to pursue that action. That is a significant reform. It has been canvassed in Australia for some time. The Committee looked at the reform particularly carefully to make sure that it would not be able to be used by particular shareholders as a technique in a guerilla warfare against the officers of the company. Despite a few reservations on behalf of individual Committee members, the Committee as a whole resolved to adopt this new action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is a significant reform. I do urge the Government to give very serious consideration to the introduction of such a derivative action. It does overcome the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and I believe that, if it is adopted, it will mean a significant improvement for the right of individual shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of the members of the Subcommittee, in particular, who examined this report&mdash;the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the former Deputy Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), and the staff of the Committee secretariat, particularly Mr Donald Nairn, all of whom put a large amount of work into getting this report up and running. I believe it is a good report with solid recommendations. I know other honourable members will canvass other aspects of it, but I do believe it is worthy of serious consideration on behalf of the Attorney-General. I hope that we will see some amendments to the corporations law along the lines suggested in the Committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are just jealous. Mr Speaker, I refer to aspects of this report which I think are worthy of wider understanding and comprehension. First, I think it is important that as legislators we do not overreact to the events of the 1980s. I am most concerned that in the professional fields&mdash;not peculiarly those covered by this legislation but across the whole ambit, from medicine through law, accounting and indeed in every one of the professions in Australia&mdash;the highest possible standards, firstly, should be set. Secondly, we should not try to enforce in the 1990s a legislative inhibition which will deny the community the opportunity to retain the skills and disciplines of those who, over the years, have built the qualities of their respective professions and which, with respect to corporate law, will deny people the chance to participate as external directors, to act as auditors, or indeed to act as legal counsel or accountants. If we are not careful, the changes that are being sought by some could well mean that we are no longer able to maintain the incentive to perform that really is characteristic of our capitalist system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I have been very pleased to see the conclusions that have been reached in this report in three areas to which I want to advert. The first is with respect to auditors. It is obviously extraordinarily difficult to interpret exactly what the true and fair obligation of an auditor is in stating his view about matters before him. There have been some very sad company failures. Some, no doubt, have distinctly been the product of those who have been the entrepreneurs of yesteryear who have gone beyond the reasonable bounds of propriety and for whom there should be no public or legislative sympathy. But to enforce upon an auditor a requirement that he should always have second vision and be able to see behind the accounts as presented to him is not equitable, nor is it possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the Committee, in reaching its conclusions with respect to auditors&mdash;and I refer those who have a particular interest to recommendations 16, 17, 18 and 19&mdash;tried to ensure that while there should be requirements to notify the Australian Securities Commission of malpractices that the audit has revealed, it has not tried to rewrite the laws. The Committee has suggested that the Australian Auditing Standards Board needs to be given similar recognition in corporations law to that of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. In that way there can be continued development of auditing standards and maintenance by the profession, under the general supervision of the Australian Securities Commission, of the extent to which there is a requirement to maintain a true and proper auditing standard to ensure that malpractices to the disadvantage of creditors or shareholders appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area that I think is particularly important in relation to the prime purport of this inquiry, and that is the rights of shareholders and their interface with directors, is a series of recommendations that pick up the business judgment rule, that define it, under recommendation 20. It looks a little further at the rights and responsibilities of directors in recommendations 21 and 22 and so on. And then, finally, the report looks at an interpretation in the final recommendation with respect to the criminal liability provisions of the corporations law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they are particularly important and I, like the Chairman of the Committee who has just spoken, would say to government, `I think the recommendations make sense but above all do not go too far. Do not try to write into corporate law responsibilities that, as I have suggested, are going to pass onto today's and tomorrow's generations, criminal liability because of those circumstances of the 1980s'. Indeed, one of my criticisms of the economic statement handed down by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) the other night is that I do not think he has really given the incentive to corporate investors to generate the jobs that are needed. And while it is not the jobs of directors that this House need particularly be concerned about, unless there is an opportunity for people to exercise responsibility as directors, the opportunity for employment in the rest of the corporate sector is no doubt lessened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, what we have tried to do is to get a balance between the proper exercise of responsibility by directors, and their interpretation within the corporations law, and the rights of shareholders. I think that the recommendations here make sense. There is no doubt that, to the extent to which further recommendations relate to the Australian Stock Exchange listing, they also bear upon the responsibilities both of disclosure and of the way in which a director undertakes both his legislative and his corporate responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I think it is particularly important that the extent to which the stock exchange rules develop should not always be necessarily matched by some type of legislative change. I am one who believes that the stock exchange does have a capacity to provide a listing requirement which ensures that there are disclosures of matters of particular significance to a company. There is a recommendation in the report which covers that, recommendation 14, so that there are obligations on the directors to comply with the listing rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those listing rules are matters which, of course, can take more account of changing patterns and practices and community requirements. But, what I am saying is that in respect of the maintenance of a liability of disclosure, of liability of exercising due and proper care with the assets of a company and conducting affairs in a proper manner, I think this report goes a reasonable distance in trying to blend the enhanced recognition of the listing rules of stock exchanges while not going so far in the change of corporate law to prevent people from accepting what are significant and onerous responsibilities as external directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third field is in the field to which the Chairman of the Committee&mdash;who has just resumed his seat&mdash;referred, and that is the derivative action concept. Recommendation 27 specifically refers to that. It is very difficult to know to what degree, both in the field of derivative action and in the requirement for disclosure, there can be a proper balance set between the need to ensure that there is, on the shareholder's part, an opportunity to know what is happening to the assets of the company of which he is a shareholder and the requirement by the board of a company to maintain confidentiality to enable commercial in confidence decisions to be taken without risk; that by those other actions they are going to be revealed in such a way that it will prejudice the interests of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there was significant debate within the Committee on the nature and character of these provisions, I think that the recommendations happily reach a fair compromise. Quite obviously there did need to be a consideration of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and of a way by which there can be some legislative variation to that. What the Committee has recommended in its amendments to the corporations law is that there should be a change to provide standing to particular persons set out in recommendation 26, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. any member or former member, of the corporation or a related corporation; . any director or officer, or former director or officer, of the corporation or a related corporation;</PARA>
<PARA>It then allows through a further recommendation that there be a capacity for people who have particular standing to seek leave to proceed on behalf of the company and to pursue a derivative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that really does help to improve the situation of shareholders who, in a number of circumstances known to many of us, seem to me to have been disadvantaged. So, we have tried to blend, in the recommendations of the Committee, the balance between the proper exercise of directors' responsibility and proper access for shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe that the Committee's report does make a significant advance in those three areas: the role and exercise of responsibilities by auditors; the role and exercise of responsibilities by directors and the access to the records of the company by shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend the report to the Government and trust that, in moving, it does not take the recommendations any further. If it does so, as I have suggested, we will be unduly imposing on today's directors a discipline and consequence of the affairs of the 1980s, which I do not think is in the best interests of the corporate sector, nor of the development of our economy in the parlous plight in which it now finds itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This was a very wide-ranging inquiry which extended over a long period of time and was mooted at a time when the circumstances in the commercial world were quite different from those which operated at the time when the report was brought down or the hearings were concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some remarks about evidence which was given relating to the status of audited balance sheets and the availability of information on which potential shareholders can make a judgment as to the assets and the value of the assets of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the conventional wisdom in Australia, which has subsequently proven to be incorrect, that an audited balance sheet does accurately reflect the state of the company or organisation concerned and that the auditor will ensure that the documents which he presents and signs are an accurate set of documents in respect of the financial status of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence before the Committee it was clearly stated that, in fact, in valuing assets, for instance, the auditors take account of the method of valuation prescribed by the directors of the organisation. In other words, it is available to the directors to have an audited balance sheet made out on the best case scenario in respect of the value of assets of an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had the circumstance in 1986 of a balance sheet which was presented in respect of the Connell bank&mdash;Rothwells&mdash;which reflected nothing of the financial situation of the bank, on which, however, a reasonable judgment could have been made by potential investors that the organisation was structurally financially sound and backed by adequate, and more than adequate, assets. It was clearly proven by subsequent events to be not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 a similar report was prepared and it was only after challenges by the regulatory bodies, in particular Mr Bosch, that the auditors decided that they would not sign the balance sheet, even though apparently, dishonest as the balance sheet may have been, it met the legal requirements for an audited balance sheet. Mr Bosch actually told the Committee that he had sought to prosecute the auditors for their earlier balance sheet which was totally inaccurate, but that he was unable to do so because of the nature of the law and the requirements which are placed on auditors. There are changes taking place but I am not certain that those changes will, in fact, prevent the practices which I have mentioned from recurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use another example. Everyone is aware that a building society in my electorate, or based in my electorate, collapsed a couple of years ago. Most people, like myself, would have believed that it was a very soundly based organisation with adequate assets trading largely in housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, on 10 February 1990, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> had a headline `Record profit is his answer to `rivals' rumours', introducing an interview with Mr Clarke, one of the directors. The chairman of the organisation had reported in the annual report that the company had record profits and had set down a balance sheet which showed a surplus of assets over liabilities of some half a billion dollars. It was marginally less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditors had found that balance sheet to be correct. But it appears that that balance sheet was based on the book value of the assets, not their actual value. This was at a time when property values had already started to decline. Some of the properties depended on boom in the property market in order to make a profit at the end and were overvalued for the purposes of the loans made against them. These were, to say the least, very risky ventures and the assessments of the valuations were also risky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A balance sheet subsequently prepared, by the same auditors, using market value for the same period, showed a change of something like $700m in the asset backing, on which that profit had been declared. It was some 30 per cent of the total asset. That was a variation in a balance sheet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is any ordinary citizen to think who reads something like this in a local paper, `The corporation's success has come at a time when other financial institutions are entering tough times' and who discovers that the organisation at that time was in fact insolvent when its balance sheet said it was in profit? That balance sheet was legally and correctly audited in accordance with the instructions which existed at the time. What hope does the ordinary citizen have in those circumstances? For 12 months, a public relations firm was able to convince newspaper editors&mdash;not only the local ones&mdash;and others, that rumours, not bad management, had caused the downfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth may be known at some time in the future when the Victorian Supreme Court decides to get itself out of the road and allow an inquiry, which has been held up by it for some time, to actually report. There is, of course, the problem that, if there happens to be a change of government in Victoria, the report will probably be buried in government pigeonholes because the Liberal Party has close connections with the organisations involved in this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other thing that I think is important that we understand about the responsibility of auditors. If, in fact, there are attached to the audit report, qualifications&mdash;and there usually are&mdash;which indicate that the auditors do not feel that the audit has been properly conducted, or that the audit does not necessarily reflect the current situation of the company, it should be an obligation for the balance sheet of the company to carry that qualification clearly and precisely. That is not always done; certainly, it is information that a potential investor is entitled to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter which concerns me&mdash;and this also forms part of the audited balance sheet of this particular organisation&mdash;is that, in announcing the annual report, the chairman was able to indicate that the liquidity ratio was 17.2 per cent. It is now known that that liquidity ratio included what were called non-redeemable shares, a device which was thought up probably somewhere else but, nevertheless, was used to inject what was said to be equity into the organisation without the principals having to advance funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Victorian Supreme Court in recent weeks, Mr Justice Vincent has indicated that that equity was raised in some cases by false pretences. I do not know whether charges will be laid because the report of the inquiry has not come down. But it is clear that many thousands of people were misled into believing that, in buying shares in this particular organisation, they were in fact investing in another form of deposit investment, not in a liability share where they had no guarantee whatsoever of a refund of their moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite honestly, I cannot understand why many of those shareholders have not sued the principals of the organisation, including the directors, who have some responsibility if their shares were sold under false pretences. That is the import of what Mr Justice Vincent found. No-one is clean in this area, but we are inquiring into the nature of the law and the right of shareholders to know what is going on in an organisation and the manner in which stock exchanges are able to conduct their business, so that shareholders are able to make a judgment on their own as to the value of what they might purchase or the competing interests of those who are selling. Under the present law that judgment cannot be made. The audit standards are one area where the law has to come up to date in order to ensure that information that bears an auditor's signature has the status and standing that I believe most members of the community believe it has and that I certainly believe it should have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is a very important report and I am going to quote comments made by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), especially, and comments made by some of my colleagues. Whilst I appreciate the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) about a certain building society in Victoria, I think it is unfortunate that he perhaps lowered the debate somewhat by crystal balling what the Liberal Party may or may not do. If the honourable member of Corio were really fair dinkum about all this, he would have put in everything, rather than pulling out a parcel of what may or may not happen in relation to the Pyramid Building Society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, if there were to be fairness about this and overall responsibility, he would have even mentioned the comments of the former Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Jolly, in February of the year of the collapse, when he said that the organisation was rock solid and there was no need for anyone to have any concerns about the financial viability of it. If we are going to allocate responsibility for community perceptions in relation to this matter, I think the Victorian Labor Government has equal responsibility with many others involved, both within and outside the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not want to speak about that in particular today. The Chairman perhaps summed up the rationale for this report when he addressed the House on 28 November and quite rightly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's approach has not been to seek scapegoats for the failures in corporate behaviour and regulations, rather to identify deficiencies in the regulatory landscape and to suggest mechanisms to empower market participants, particularly investors, in enforcing their rights and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Chairman on that comment because I think it takes a sensible approach to what is indeed a matter that caused us all great concern during the 1980s. My colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made the comment that it is appropriate not to overreact to these sorts of things. My concern is that, if we go down the path of rigidity, there is some risk that we can actually direct endeavours into antisocial practices, as opposed to perhaps achieving what we wanted to achieve, and that is to avoid them. Although I am a believer in some regulation, I believe that rigidity of regulation can sometimes achieve what it actually did not want to achieve and it can take an opposite purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-regulation versus legislative regulation is a matter which I suspect has been coming before this House since 1901. I am sure that the question will be raised again in the next 100 years. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Fisher and I will not be here in 100 years but I am sure that the matters we are debating today will be raging into the next 10 or 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not on the Committee when this report was tabled so I was not privy to the discussions nor indeed was I privy to the discussions that the Committee had with various people around Australia. I am sorry that I was not on the Committee at that stage because I believe, from speaking to my colleagues, that some very interesting discussions took place with a great number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing we need to do is look at what the driving force is that pushes those people into antisocial and anti-commercial practices. Of course, this report could never have addressed that but I think that it is an interesting question that we need to address further down the line. Is it a matter of greed; is it a matter of overt enthusiasm for the particular institution that a company officer might be working for; or is it a perception that the Government is not assisting that particular business or business in general? I would like to sit down with someone who has been involved in this antisocial behaviour to find out what their motives were for it. I can see the smile on the honourable member for Fisher's face. Perhaps he would be interested to join me in those discussions to try to get away from the legislative and legal parts and find out exactly what the reasons were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty, of course, in any question on regulation is that there is a fine line between interfering with the rights of company officers to properly run the business and the rights of shareholders. I think that this report seeks to put a far greater onus&mdash;an onus that I certainly support&mdash;on those who have an intimate knowledge of the running of the company. I think that it is fair to say that the 99 per cent of Australian shareholders who are normally small investors would know very little about the particular company in which they have a shareholding. There would be very few who would go to annual general meetings of those organisations. They do not have an intimate knowledge. They rely very heavily on the good faith of the officers of that company. Therefore, when looking at the regulatory model that needs to be set up in relation to the proper conduct of Australian business, it has to be appreciated that that onus lies with those who have the more intimate knowledge. I think that recommendation 18 addresses the sorts of concerns that I have. It allows, in effect, third parties to regulate the way that Australian business is conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of my colleagues have expressed some concerns in a reservation, and I have my name on that, in relation to recommendation 26. I think that my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) encapsulated my concerns about that when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern was that, by empowering former shareholders and former directors to bring such actions, people who had no connection with the wrong that was being taken up in the company's name and who possibly had no interest in the outcome of the action would be bringing actions in the company's name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is important that, when it comes to allowing the derivative action, the court should assess who is the most appropriate person to bring the corporation's right of action. It may be that a former shareholder who was not there at the time the wrong was committed and has no interest in the outcome is not the right person to enforce the corporation's right of action. If provision is made for the court to take that into account, as I have said in the reservation, I have no difficulty; but I think to widen the class and not make any specific proposal as to how that can be taken into account is too bald and too wide on the basis of the evidence that came before the Committee. That is why we entered that reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe this is an important report not just for this Parliament but for corporations in this country, because it gives them direction and shows them that this Parliament does not necessarily want to wield a big stick, but the Parliament quite rightly expects that antisocial corporate behaviour should not continue. I think that we can go forward with these recommendations, which set a framework for a realistic and responsible approach. I hope the Government will take up the recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that this Bill was ever necessary. It is a great pity that the Government could not consult properly with interest groups, that the Government could not listen. What this Bill is all about is to repeal part of the Australian design rule No. 19.01 which deals with electrical connections on motorcycles. The aim of the Australian design rule which has come into force as of 1 March 1992 is to force all new motorcycles that are sold from 1 March onwards to have the headlight wired on so that, when the engine is started, the headlight will automatically come on. In this Bill we deal specifically with clause 19.6.106.9 of that Australian design rule No. 19.01. We are specifically moving that this be removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that in my time as a shadow Minister, I have never seen an issue so unite an interest group in total opposition. I have not had one single motorcyclist come to me and say that this is a good move&mdash;not one. I have, as I say, consulted widely; I have met with many, and all of them give the same answer, that compulsorily having lights on is not the way to go to improve road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is that when you look for the research evidence, both in Australia and overseas, you find that what is lacking is conclusive evidence that having lights wired on is in fact going to add to road safety. It means, therefore, that the decision to have a light wired on is one that has been taken by the Government in haste, one that has been taken without properly researching the issue and one that has clearly been taken without properly consulting those most directly affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly that the decision to turn on the light on a motorcycle during the day should be the responsibility of the individual rider. While the majority of cyclists do turn their lights on at least some of the time when they are riding, there are other times when experienced riders are quite adamant that having the light on can add to the risk and in fact is sometimes downright dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other points that I do not believe the Government has thought through in changing the Australian design rule. One of them is the question of legal liability. It is still not clear whether or not this will add to the liability of the motorcyclist who may be involved in an accident with a motor car because it will be very difficult in most cases to prove whether or not the light was actually on. The globe might have blown five seconds before the accident, or the day before. It will be very hard to prove whether that was the case or whether in fact the globe was smashed in the accident. So the question of legal liability could become quite an interesting one and, of course, there are ramifications for insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point about changing the design rule is that it could add to a false sense of security, if people believe by having the light wired on it will somehow make them safer. Of course, in many cases, it could be the exact opposite. There are other concerns, which I will explore when there is a full debate. There is the question of the difficulty some motorists have in judging the speed and the distance apart of an oncoming vehicle with its headlights on. Again, this is where it could, in fact, add to danger rather than add to safety. Then, of course, we have the nonsense with agbikes having to have the light on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill 1992 which says, in essence, that a person who desecrates or otherwise dishonours the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign, or without lawful authority burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign, shall be guilty of an offence with a maximum penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the introduction of this Bill has been long and tortuous. I first introduced an almost identical Bill into the House on 4 May 1989. The Government did not allow it to come on for debate, so the coalition moved for debate as a matter of urgency in the Budget session of that year; but the Government refused to allow a second reading debate and gagged the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following year, on 31 May 1990, I reintroduced the Bill, as it had lapsed. On 23 August 1990 and on 18 October 1990 there was a brief, almost token, second reading debate during private members' business before the debate was terminated. During that debate there was unanimous support from coalition members for this Bill, and I was pleased to see there was considerable support from Government members also for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it was allowed to lapse again and on 30 May 1991 I had to reintroduce the Bill. The Government chose to let it lapse yet again and today, on 5 March 1992, I have reintroduced this Bill for the fourth time. On the times this Bill has been introduced previously, I have detailed how the need for it came about. Basically, there is no penalty in Australia for those who deface or dishonour our flag. I strongly believe that, if a flag is worth having, it is worth protecting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great majority of Australian people have had a gutful of unkempt demonstrators burning our flag in front of television cameras. Most citizens of this country find such behaviour grossly offensive and distressing. I believe such behaviour mocks our traditions and mocks our heritage simply for selfish gain and to get some cheap publicity for their cause&mdash;which is usually totally unrelated to what they are doing to our flag. There are penalties against such behaviour in many countries, and I believe it is well overdue that such penalties were also introduced here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments against this Bill are usually based on superficialities or misunderstandings. Some say that the penalties, for example, are too severe. I stress that they are maximum penalties and, like all penalties, the penalty will reflect the degree of the offence and usually would be of much less severity. There is nothing particularly draconian about these penalties in this Bill. They are par for the course for an offence of this nature, and they are similar to what is in legislation in other countries such as Norway, New Zealand, Japan and America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some say that stopping this activity will infringe civil liberties. It never ceases to amaze me why civil liberty people seem all too ready to jump to the defence of those who want to burn our national flag in protest. The energies of these people would be much better directed towards the victims of crimes in society. Civil libertarians always seem pretty thin on the ground in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are ample opportunities in this country for people to protest without offending the great majority of Australian people by burning Australian flags. We have to have limits on behaviour in this country. We do not allow graffiti artists to display their efforts on the walls of the Australian National Gallery, for example. We have to draw the line somewhere. I stress that these people who protest are not actually protesting against the flag as such but against something else which is totally unrelated. I make no apology for wanting to draw the line about our national symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we ban burning the flag, it will actually do these people's cause good because all they do is alienate the great mass of the Australian community. Some people believe that this would include flags on T-shirts, but I stress that these are not flags at all; these are only reproductions. At the worst it would only be a breach of etiquette, protocol or convention. People who display flags on T-shirts and such are not exactly dishonouring the flag; they actually are very proud of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Flags Amendment Bill has one aim and one aim only, that is, to entrench the current Australian flag so that the flag cannot be altered except by a referendum passed by a majority of electors throughout the Australian States and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say two principal things about this amendment Bill. Firstly, in trying to achieve its aim it is fundamentally flawed. Secondly, I wish to canvass the principal issue involved, which concerns whether Australia should at this stage be considering changing its flag and what mechanisms should be employed if that consideration is to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this particular Bill is flawed is that it attempts to impose a requirement of a referendum before the flag can be changed by adding a new section 9(1) to the Flags Act. This proposed new section requires that a referendum be held before the flag can be changed. However, the difficulty that the mover of this private member's Bill has is that, while that Act can be changed to put in a requirement that there be a referendum before the flag can be changed, he has not put in a requirement that that proposed new section, if incorporated into the principle Act, could not be removed by subsequent amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the exercise is to take out of the hands of this Parliament basically the change of the Australian flag and put it in the hands of the Australian people, but he does not take out of the hands of this Parliament the ability to merely remove that provision, if enacted, out of the Act. That might seem a moot point, but it is not. It came to light in Queensland in the mid-1970s when the then Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was somewhat concerned with the way in which the Whitlam Government was going at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might recall that the Whitlam Government started moving down the track of asserting Australian independence and cutting some of the remaining ties between Australia and Great Britain. I suppose the most notable of those actions was the removal of the right of appeal from the Australian High Court to the Privy Council. As well as removing that right of appeal, the Whitlam Government went down the track of installing an Australian honours system and attempting to remove the imperial honours system. Even though that did exist for a considerable time in some of the States, it was removed at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Joh was apparently alarmed that this may then extend to the Queen no longer being the Queen of Australia, even though it was, in fact, a Whitlam Government which installed the Queen as Queen of Australia. In response, however, Sir Joh succeeded in changing the Queensland Constitution to make the Queen the Queen of Queensland. As is the case with this particular Act, the Flags Act, the Queensland Constitution is merely an Act of the Queensland Parliament. That is, it is not like the Commonwealth Constitution which can be amended only by way of referendum. The Queensland Constitution is like any Act of parliament, and can be amended by a subsequent parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Joh, realising this and being somewhat more suspicious of the motives of the Labor Party than those of the good honourable member who has introduced this particular Bill, attempted to doubly entrench the provision to make the Queen the Queen of Queensland. By that, he required not only that there be a referendum so that this provision of the Queen of Queensland could be changed, but that the provision installing that in the Constitution could itself be removed only by referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raised a whole variety of interesting legal points, particularly around whether a parliament can bind a subsequent parliament in that way in an interpretation of section 11 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. I will not get into the constitutional niceties of the argument except to say that it was broadly accepted in legal circles in Queensland after the Queensland Parliament passed provisions in that way. It was effectively entrenched that the status of the Queen of Queensland now can be removed only by way of referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mover of this particular private member's Bill attempts to secure the same end, that is, to have the Australian flag changed only by way of referendum. But unfortunately for the mover, he has not placed his mind to the fact that the provision itself requiring the referendum can be removed by Act of parliament. Hence in a legal way it is really quite useless. Having said that, I think it would be quite wrong that if this amendment were passed by this Parliament a subsequent parliament should ignore the express wishes of this Act and attempt to circumvent its clear intention, by merely removing the provision, even though that course would be open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether you want to take point with the effectiveness of the procedure or not, the point then turns upon whether Australia should, at this time, be considering the flag and whether it is still appropriate for Australia. Like most members in this place, one of my more pleasant duties is to present Australian flags to schools, organisations and clubs,  and I suppose during the four and a bit years that I have been a member of this place, the number of flags I have presented is probably now in the hundreds. They are one of the few things members of parliament actually can give away for free, so it is always a great joy to be able to give something rather than always seeming to take things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a strong patriotism amongst Australians. Wearing their hearts on their sleeves is not something which Australians are renowned for, but in times of national crisis or great national pride we certainly do see public expressions of patriotism in this country. Like any issue, to two different people, patriotism can mean two different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To many Australians, to be patriotic means sticking to what they see to be the traditions of this country and paying great credence to our British heritage, of which the Australian flag is a very important symbol. There is also the argument that the flag was a symbol which was used by Australia in time of war, and is always flown when Australia is competing at Olympic Games or other international events, when we are present at the United Nations, and things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respect people's views about this, and to that extent it is probably appropriate that before we change the Australian flag there should be a deep public debate and ultimately a vote on behalf of the Australian people. Whether it is necessary to require by Act of this Parliament that there be a referendum before the change can take place, or whether the procedure should rather be as when we selected <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> as our national anthem&mdash;by way of a referendum not required by law&mdash;is again a matter we could have some debate about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view about the flag is that it should be changed. I do not believe that it is particularly appropriate, as Australia approaches its centenary as an independent nation, that the Union Jack should feature as part of our national flag, but I understand that many people could have deeply and sincerely held views opposite to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major feature of our flag which symbolises the great southern continent is the Southern Cross, and I think a flag based around a design of the Southern Cross would be an appropriate national symbol. I think we now are at the stage that we should be debating this issue, maybe up to the centenary of our nationhood. Maybe at that time it would be appropriate for there to be a referendum and the selection of a new flag, if that is what the majority of Australians want. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same outcome has yet to be achieved in the House of Representatives, although it has not been for want of trying. This is the fourth time the Coalition has attempted to have this Bill passed. It is a simple, straightforward piece of legislation, not complicated in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Flags Act 1953 to ensure our Australian national flag cannot be altered except with the approval of the Australian people voting in a referendum. Anyone who argues that this Bill has been designed to prevent our flag being changed has missed the whole point of the exercise. There is nothing in this Bill that states or even implies that changes cannot or will not be made; only that they cannot be imposed without the consent of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a majority of Australians say, `Yes, we want the flag changed', then it will be changed. If the majority says no, then under the provisions of this Bill the flag will remain as it is. Surely this is what democracy is all about. Unfortunately, some members of the Government do not seem to agree with this simple and basic democratic proposition. If they did, they would be supporting the passage of this Bill. Instead, they argue that protection is not necessary because they do not have any plans to alter our flag&mdash;at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their protestations and assurances are of little consequence and even less relevance, because the Bill does not only apply to this present Government but to all future governments, irrespective of their particular political persuasion. If and when this Bill is passed, and the proposed amendment becomes law, it will be just as binding on a Liberal-National Party government as on a Labor one, and that is exactly how it should be, because the flag we are talking about in this debate&mdash;the Australian national flag&mdash;is not the property of the government of the day, or of the Parliament. It is the people's flag and it belongs to all Australians, and the right and proper way to find out whether or not the Australian people want it changed is to ask them by way of a referendum. What could be more reasonable or sensible? What could be a fairer or more accurate test of public opinion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there will be those who protest that it is often very difficult to achieve change via a referendum pathway. There is certainly some evidence to indicate that the Australian people are inherently suspicious of referenda and are therefore inclined to vote to preserve the status quo. And on past experience, who can blame them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am very confident that the majority of the Australian people are well able to assess the merits of a particular proposal. They know whether they want to accept it or reject it and they cast their votes accordingly. The fact that so relatively few proposals get the nod at referendum time is not so much a reflection on the abilities of the voters to grasp the issues as on the quality of the proposals put before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as members of the coalition parties are endeavouring to secure Government support for this legislation, there is a concerted effort by an organisation known as Ausflag Ltd to deprive the Australian people of their right to determine the future of our most important national symbol. The supporters of Ausflag Ltd want to change our flag, and they want to change it now. They want to change it for all the wrong reasons&mdash;and most regrettably&mdash;they want to change it via the back door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter sent to members of parliament towards the end of last year, Mr Scruby, the Executive Director of Ausflag, left no questions in anyone's mind as to the Ausflag agenda, or how it intends to implement it. When I started to read Mr Scruby's letter I was not sure whether he was confused or simply ill-informed. Mr Scruby wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is vital in these times that Australia has its own flag.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more, Mr Scruby. It is vital that we have our own flag. Fortunately, we have a very good one and we have had it now for almost 100 years. If our Australian national flag is not our flag, then whose is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then I read on and it became alarmingly clear that Mr Scruby and the organisation he represents are not really concerned about Australia having its own flag at all. What they actually want is for us to have their flag and they are determined to impose it on us whether we like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem seems to be the Union Jack which Mr Scruby and Ausflag are not very keen on at all. Mr Scruby is at pains to point out in his letter that the Australian people do not even have to be consulted about this matter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A change to the Australian flag can be effected by a simple Act of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes it all sound so easy. A simple Act of Parliament. I would not describe it as a simple Act, Mr Scruby; I would describe it as a grossly irresponsible and totally unacceptable Act. And I do not believe for one moment that members of this Parliament, even the Prime Minister, who recently advocated changing our flag, would countenance such an underhanded, divisive and basically dishonest course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their determination to convince Australians that the Union Jack should be expunged from our flag, the Ausflag people go to quite extraordinary lengths to deceive and mislead. Among other things, they suggest that our present flag has some detrimental effect on our potential to increase our export markets. Where is the proof to back up this absurd claim? Where is the evidence of one major&mdash;or for that matter, one minor&mdash;contract lost because of the appearance of our flag? Waterfront reform and an improved industrial relations system are what is needed to improve our export potential and competitiveness. Our flag has nothing to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also claim that our flag is confusing to the rest of the world. Actually, it is not our flag but New Zealand's flag, which looks very like ours, that seems to be causing all the trouble. I have a simple solution to both these problems. Why do we not export Ausflag Ltd to New Zealand and let it try to convince our friends across the Tasman to change their flag? In that way we can kill two birds with one stone&mdash;an increase in our exports and an end to all the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ausflag people and others of similar ilk may want to change our flag but they cannot change our past. Whether they like it or not, altering the design of our flag will not and cannot alter facts that are now history. Australia was a British colony, a part of the British Empire, and our flag reflects that fact. Our language, our parliamentary system, our legal system, and the protections and safeguards of our system of government, which are reinforced by a constitutional monarchy, are all institutions which we have inherited from Britain, and they are inextricably woven into the fabric of our Australian heritage and our Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim that we need a new flag to signify that we are an independent nation in our own right is to replace reality with absurdity. Rather than proving we are coming of age, it would be a startling example of our ongoing immaturity. We are already an independent nation. If some of us have not yet come to grips with this fact, a new flag certainly will not help. Flags cannot create national pride and confidence or a sense of national purpose and identity; they can only reflect it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not planned to speak on this Bill today, but as the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) is ill, I have had to step into the breach. I have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate so far. As I understand it, the Bill seeks to compel anybody who wants to change the Australian flag to hold a referendum. I must say that this is rather novel in the federal sense because, at least up until now, referendums have only been used to try to change the Constitution and, as it has been pointed out, not very successfully. In fact, I think the only time referendums have got up in the past has been when the Labor Party has joined with the Government to ensure that the proposals have been passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the latest set of referendum proposals, it gives us a fair idea of how much value the Liberal Party and the National Party put on referendums. For those who cannot remember, in 1988 the Government put up four different proposals, one of which was to recognise local government. One would have thought that in the grand scheme of things local government plays a significant part in Australian government, and yet the Liberal Party and the National Party advocated a no vote against recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution. If they are as shameless as that about something as important as the role of local government in Australian government and they advocate a no vote for that, how can they be trusted with anything else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I honestly think the holding of referendums should be, as it is now, only to change our Constitution. Let us face it, the Opposition now is putting up a proposal radically to change our tax system, with no talk of a referendum for that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The difference between the daily impact of changing our flag and of changing our tax system is obvious. Obviously, the well-being of the Australian people would be very much more disadvantaged financially by the proposals being put up by the Liberal and National parties to tax food and clothing, and yet there is no talk of a referendum on that. The honourable members of the Opposition are quite happy for those sorts of pieces of legislation to go through this Parliament, but mention the flag and the reaction is, `Oh no, we cannot put that through the Parliament. This Parliament is not representative enough to change the flag', and yet they think food and clothing can be taxed without having recourse to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that today the honourable member opposite introduced another Bill to do with the flag. It seems to me the Liberal Party and the National Party have a fetish about flags when they are in opposition. Between 1975 and 1983 they were the Government. I would have thought that this fetish, had it existed back then, could have been accommodated then. They could have passed legislation then because they controlled the Senate and the House of Representatives. So how is it, here in 1992 when they are in opposition, that they bring up this proposal when they were not prepared to do it when they were in government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be self-evident. The honourable members opposite have not much to talk about so here we are talking about the flag. Let us just assume that they are dinkum about this referendum proposal, that there are good reasons for it and forget everything I have said. Consider just the practical difficulties. One assumes, of course, that there is a choice between the existing flag and one other. It may not be. Ausflag, to which the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) referred, had a number of proposals. A referendum cannot sort that out. The mechanics of it just cannot work with a referendum. I think that if we were to change our flag then this Parliament should do it, or it should be announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the legal obstacles to changing the flag. I know a few years ago we changed the national anthem from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>. That was announced by the Prime Minister and the sun still came up the next day. Australia still carried on. There was no talk then about referendums about changing the national anthem. I think the legislation that has been put up is totally unnecessary. I am not going to support it, even though I think that in 1992, as we come towards the year 2001, the 100th anniversary of the Commonwealth, it would be a good time to change the flag, there is no doubt about that. I think Australia in 2001 will be a totally different country to what it was in 1901. The make-up of our population, the aspirations we have, are certainly much different now than they were back then. So for those reasons I would favour a change and also the proclamation of a republic at the same time. It seems that, as we mature as a country and as we make our way in the world, both of those things could happen in 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always reminded of this matter, as are other speakers, when I go to schools to present flags. At one school I went to I asked them what they knew about the flag, and their response was very little. So I gave them the little book that we all hand out. But I did ask them how many of them knew what the Canadian flag looked like and everybody in the school put up their hand. These were only primary school children. I cannot remember exactly but they might have been years five or six. They all knew the Canadian flag, a very distinctive flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lived in Canada for about two years and I know the sorts of arguments we are getting in Australia about changing the flag. We are told how everybody died for the flag, when in actual fact they died more for their country than for their flag. The Canadians had this argument about 30 years ago, but they overcame it. Do honourable members know who the greatest defenders of the flag are now? The greatest defenders of the flag are their equivalent of our RSL. They think it is a great flag. There are people in Canada who would not even know what the old Canadian flag was like. It was a fairly unspectacular flag, unlike the one they have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the change of the flag in Canada actually gave the country a much better identity, or a more identifiable character. It is certainly supported by all the people in Canada now and they would never get a proposition to go back to the old one. I suppose the most visible display of somebody wanting to change the flag occurred at the time of the America's Cup back in 1983 when Mr Bond and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Challenge</EMPHASIS> crew did not use the Australian flag but used a green flag with a boxing kangaroo on it to identify themselves as Australians. They did that because outside this country, nobody knows our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On occasion, when Australians have travelled overseas, the New Zealand flag has been hoisted up in error because they are so similar. We can see the frustration of an international sporting crew, like the America's Cup crew, who actually won the cup, having to design a flag of their own to identify themselves as Australians. That sort of thing should not happen, and it really does display to us the fact that the Australian flag just is not doing the job. For all of those reasons, I would say that the Australian Flag should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a previous debate there was some talk about the time when we changed the currency. I was only a kid back then, but I think it was Sir Robert Menzies who wanted to call the new currency the `royal', or something like that. Thank goodness that it ended up as the dollar. Could honourable members imagine spending 40 royals or 50 royals a week? It is just mad stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that this debate also just points to the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties. The Labor Party is the party of progress, the party that is looking to the future, whereas the conservatives are trapped in the past, want to hang onto everything in the past, and really would be more happy in the 1950s than in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons, I oppose the Bill. Like many members on this side, I look forward to the day on which Australia does have a new flag and, hopefully, becomes a republic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the Flags Amendment Bill, which argues that, before our national flag can be changed, a referendum should be held so that the voice of the Australian people can be heard. I am amazed at the opposition from the Government members who have spoken this morning. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), said that we cannot have a referendum on such things. If my memory serves me correctly, it was the Fraser Government that had a referendum on determining what Australia's national song would be. I voted for the wrong one; I voted for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> at the time. That is how we determined that we would have <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it very distressing, as I believe the majority of Australian people do, that the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seems hell-bent on having our national flag changed or, more specifically, having the Union Jack removed from the top left-hand corner of our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, he has combined this opposition to our flag with slamming the British. It is interesting to examine why he might be doing this. There probably are a number of reasons. In part, it is his bog Irish coming out. He seems to have a cultural imprint which has imprisoned him with certain prejudices and which has sequestered his mind in such a way that he cannot rise above this irrational and paranoid dislike of everything English. In part, it is also because he wants to create a diversion. This is an old ploy; it has been used back since the time of the French Revolution and probably earlier than that: he wants to create a diversion away from the economic mess this country is in today, with a million jobless and a net overseas debt of $145 billion. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The inadequacy of the economic statement did nothing for the misery and hardship in this country today. I have to acknowledge that, in creating this diversion, he was largely successful. Also, in part, he has raised this thing of Australia becoming a republic and doing away with our flag because he has wanted to unite the left wing behind him in his own Party. Again, I have to acknowledge that he has been successful. The left wing has been gullible in this. Those who were opposing him only a couple of weeks ago seem, from statements they have made, to have fallen in behind him, though I often wonder where the allegiances of these people lie. I noted, when the Queen was here only last week, that those who have been most often in opposition to her were in the front line to shake her hand and meet her, standing there giggling with excitement and expectation and fawning all over her. I have some difficulty in finding what they actually do believe in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members who are in opposition to this Bill that the flag was not imposed upon the Australian people by some anglophile bureaucrat or politician; it was decided by the Australian people themselves. On 1 January 1901 the six colonies that occupied this continent decided to unite into one Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We decided, naturally enough, that it would be a good idea to have a flag, and we had a competition to choose an Australian flag. There were over 30,000 entries. There was a panel set up to judge the best entries. Five people were chosen because they had similar designs. Those five people were: Mrs A. Dorrington of Perth, Mr E. J. Nuttall of Melbourne, Mr Ivor Evans of Melbourne, Mr Leslie Hawkins of Sydney, and, interestingly enough, Mr W. Stephens of Auckland. So the flag we have today was chosen by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most Australians are very proud, as I am, of the flag. It reflects many things. It reflects our present and it reflects our past. The Southern Cross reflects our present, which can, to all intents and purposes, only be seen from the southern hemisphere. The number of points on each of the stars is significant. There are seven points on each of the stars&mdash;except for the little fifth one on the Southern Cross&mdash;representing the six States: one each for the States and one for the two Territories. Also, the blue of the flag represents the sea that surrounds this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past is represented by the Union Jack in the corner; it represents our heritage and it is from there&mdash;as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) said&mdash;that we got our system of democracy, our system of justice with common law and fair play and the Australian version of that, a fair go for all. We also got our education system and our language from England&mdash;though I do note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sometimes abuses that. But 75 per cent of Australians still come from that part of the world&mdash;England, Scotland or Ireland. The freedoms that we enjoy, including the freedoms that the Prime Minister enjoys, are based upon that heritage. Why the Prime Minister wants to deny that part of our history is quite beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who oppose our present flag talk about a cultural cringe. They say that the Union Jack says that we somehow are subservient or inferior or whatever, that we have not proven ourselves by fully displaying our independence. But to me that is similar to saying that you have to change your surname when you turn 21, or else you cannot prove that you are independent of your father. The whole concept is a nonsense. I believe that instead we should be proud of our lineage and we should acknowledge it. I would say that it is the Prime Minister himself who suffers from the cultural cringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand is happy to have the Union Jack on its flag, as is Hawaii and as is South Africa. The Prime Minister cites the case of the Canadian flag, which was changed 20-odd years ago. While it is a very attractive flag, it has not united the country any more. The country is just as divided between the francophiles and the anglophiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from the Prime Minister's radio interview that he gave on 31 January on 6WF in Perth. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .the flag has to be the emblem of a united country, it has been that. But I think there is probably some ambivalence in our message as we go into the international forums and the international marketplace draped in a somewhat ambivalent garb with a flag which has obviously, a flag of another country in its corner. I should think Australians would think they were advantaged in the world in the international marketplace where we are now trading much more than we ever were in the past with something which was the emblem of a country which unambiguously has a flag which represents it and nobody else.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It doesn't surprise me this debate is around because people, I suppose people around the world are entitled to say, well look, we look at your flag, you have the flag of another country in the corner. I mean are you a colony or are you a nation? You are entitled to ask the question. The Canadians gave them an answer, they said now we are one country, we are ourselves, we are independent, we look like we are and we represent ourselves as an independent country.</PARA>
<PARA>Another question from the interviewer Kennedy was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a change you would like to see while you are Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is something that ought to come in its turn, as the community feels that such a change is warranted. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is totally unambiguous that the Prime Minister wants the flag changed and the Union Jack taken out. But the arguments that he puts are nonsense. Who amongst us has ever been asked by overseas countries, before we do trade with them, whether we are ashamed to have the Union Jack in the corner? It is a very distinctive flag. There are very few distinctive flags in the world. The flags of most nations are only two or three stripes of different colours. Many flags are very similar and there is no demand for them to be changed. It is actually very hard to design a flag. I think the Ausflag competition in 1988 ended up with a design showing the Southern Cross and a yellow stripe along the bottom. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote here Dame Mary Gilmore, who must be seen as one of the great Australian nationalists. It is a line that I saw fit to print on a publication I have circulated, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Australian Retrospective</EMPHASIS>. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Never allow the thoughtless to declare that we have no tradition here.</PARA>
<PARA>She is absolutely right. There are great traditions in Australia, traditions we should be proud to uphold. I suspect that the pressure to change the flag is coming from the people who would like to take away those traditions. As one member of this House mentioned earlier, there is a group in Australia&mdash;I would call it a dissident group&mdash;that has always been looking for a republic or looking to change the flag. That group has never really amounted to much. In recent times it has been taken over by the multicultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The multicultural industry was foisted on the people of Australia by both political parties. The Australian people have never been given an opportunity to vote on this matter. If we had a referendum tomorrow on multiculturalism, the people of Australia, both the migrants and the native-born, would throw it out because it is probably the most divisive thing that has ever been established in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the multiculturalists, and the people who run with them, seeking to do? The people in groups such as the Ausflag group and the Australian Republican Movement have been taken over by the multiculturalists. They are seeking to destroy the Anglo-Celtic culture, to remove it from our history so that they can have a blank piece of paper on which they can write their new history of Australia. They see Australia as a little republic that is going to open its arms to the whole world and become a melting pot for the whole world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw recently that one of these advocates said that Australia could accommodate a population of 100 million people quite comfortably. Yes, Australia could accommodate 100 million people, but at a living standard somewhat worse than Bangladesh. I had never heard so much nonsense spoken. It appals me that it is given currency by some of the members in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that this is where the pressure is coming from. There is also an element in Australia that says that we must show our independence, we must do something. What Australia must do is genuine achievement. I say to these people that there is no pressure from Britain threatening Australia's nationhood. There is no pressure from Britain undermining this country in any way. That pressure is coming from elsewhere. It is ready to create straw men to attack the flag that we have inherited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should consider what is really threatening Australia. Many of those people who seek to make Australia a republic and seek to change the flag are the very people who are busily taking us into north-east Asia. They are saying to us, in effect, `We must stop being colonies; we must stop being a colony of Britain'&mdash;the reality is that we have not been a colony of Britain for many, many years&mdash;`and we must now become a colony of Asia; we must tie ourselves to this new rising star'. These are the same people who took us from being a colony of Britain and tied us to the apron strings of America, something which I have objected to for many years. This was the continuation of the colonial cringe. What is happening is that this cringe is being sold to the Australian public as nationalism. It is not; it is the antithesis of Australian nationalism. It is a continuation of that cringe. I think it is a very dangerous way to be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard that Canada changed its flag 25 years ago. Yes, it did change its flag. It now has a spectacular flag. It reminds me of an emblem that used to appear on a certain brand of flour. It certainly has not united the Canadian nation. I think it is inevitable that Canada is slowly but surely sinking to becoming a State of the United States. It already has a trade agreement with the United States. It is causing a lot of problems in Canada. I would say that the future for Canada under its new flag is not a great one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the economic imperative. People are saying `Yes, we must have our own flag so that we can be more comfortable with our trading nations'. Quite frankly, the nations we trade with do not give a damn what flag we have. They trade with us for natural advantage. If we are supplying to them cheaper or better or more quickly, they will buy from us. They will buy from us no matter what the flag is. It is a matter of no consequence at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just another manifestation of this cultural cringe. People also say, `We Australians must seek approval from the world'. For my part, I say, `To hell with the world. This is our flag and we will make decisions about it. We are not going to be influenced by what the world thinks'. I think that is a message that ought to be drummed home to every politician in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at the future. We are living in times of great change and we see enormous instability. There are people I see who are mindlessly applauding what is taking place in the Soviet Union, a Soviet Union that is very slowly groping towards the light, you might say, has been convulsed by what is virtually revolution and is now disintegrating. What we will see out of that as likely as a rise of democracy&mdash;in fact, I believe far more likely&mdash;is a rise of Islamic fundamentalism in its Asian provinces and a rise of the new German empire on its western front. Many of those small enclaves that have separated themselves from the Soviet Union are more likely to become fascist states than they are to become democratic. There is no history of democracy there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these circumstances, it is going to put intolerable strain on the European Common Market. Already the French are getting wary of the Germans spanning into Eastern Europe and still trying to maintain their dominance of western Europe through the Common Market. I predict that the Common Market itself will come under intolerable strains. And even in Britain we see the same thing: this phenomenon rising where the Scots and the Welsh, or some of them, are wanting to go their own way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that, in a very short time, we could have a unique flag, a flag that told the world the history that is embodied in our flag. And what a great history it is. There is a tendency amongst the multicultural brigade to say, `All cultures are equal'. This is nonsense. All cultures are not equal. What the British culture has done is give the world the rule of law. It is this that is embodied in the United States. It is this that we have built on. It is that culture that has given us the sense of fair play that is expressed in Australia as the `fair go'. These are cultural things which are of great value and I see no harm in recognising whence they come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that changing the flag would be divisive. I do not see why, in the mad pursuit for some contrived unity, we should change the flag which is supported by the majority to placate a minority. In any case, where is this minority? To go back to multiculturalism, most migrants do not approve of it. Most migrants come to this country in a desire to be Australian. They come here because they see Australia as a place for the future, a place of advantage for their children. In many cases, they do not want to continue the shackles of life in their original country. I believe there is no great pressure from migrants to change the flag. Even if there were, should we as a nation succumb to that pressure? I say certainly not, and certainly not without a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have to say a couple of things about the national anthem. I did not vote for the national anthem that we have today. I think it is the anthem of a Third World country. The words are cringing and grovelling. I voted for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS>. I thought that would be an anthem that said, very proudly, `This is Australia'. Wherever one goes in the world, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> is the Australian song. People say to me, `How can you possibly have an anthem about a sheep thief? I say, `It is our song and we can have what we like'. I do not care what the world thinks about our anthem. I would very proudly sing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS>. For one thing, I and most Australians know the words. If we are going to have any changes in Australia, I would advocate changing that pompous anthem that we have and going for something that is truly Australian, not the contrived drivel that we now stand for and mumble to simply because we do not know the words or, in some cases, because we do not approve of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion let me say that this is a fundamental issue. A referendum is absolutely essential before the flag is changed.

I want to say to those who are in the gallery and those who may be listening to the Parliament on the airwaves that the remarks made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie are remarks that ought to be lauded and applauded around Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie in many ways reflects what the life of this Parliament is all about. I can find sundry and assorted things on which he and I will disagree, numerous issues of policy on which we will disagree, but he is prepared to stand up and put a healthy independence into the debate, and I applaud him for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be on this side of the Parliament because here independence is welcomed. Over half of my South Australian Liberal Federal parliamentary colleagues have crossed the floor because they believed in something that was bigger than the party. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is a lone member of the Australian Labor Party who reflects a similar healthy independence, and it ought to be lauded and applauded and welcomed on his side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament has been largely failed, not by the party system but by the Press Gallery&mdash;and I do not reflect on Australian Associated Press&mdash;which has failed to see that sort of independence as democracy at its best. Instead, when members have crossed the floor, members of the press have wanted to allege that the leader was losing control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this Bill, which seeks to have the flag that Australia owns as its own changed only by referendum. In common with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I spent my schoolboy days standing in a school yard and saying, `I love my country, I salute her flag, I honour her Queen, and I promise to obey her laws'. I did it with all the appropriate actions, in concert with the rest of the school. From my schoolboy perspective, King George VI and later Queen Elizabeth II were on the throne and lived in Buckingham Palace; Sir Robert Menzies lived in Canberra; and Sir Thomas Playford lived in Adelaide. My world was secure. It may not have been good&mdash;the influence may not have been perfect&mdash;but I insist that I was proud of it and that those traditions did not leave me warped, humiliated or negative. I felt no cultural cringe in claiming to love my country and salute her flag, and this morning I refuse to apologise for or abandon my heritage and my traditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the honourable member for Wannon's Flags Amendment Bill. Every Australian should ensure that the traditions that are so proudly ours cannot be altered except by referendum. We heard from the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) that, when the Opposition parties were in government, we did not introduce this sort of legislation. He is right; we did not&mdash;we had no need to. There was never any suggestion that we would propose a change to the flag unless the people of Australia had first sought it and a clear majority believed that it was in their interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then drew the sort of long bow I could not believe, even from a man of his articulateness, in drawing a comparison between taxation changes in this country and our flag. That was almost indecent. We are not saying that the flag should never be changed, though personally I am quite comfortable with it in its present form, reflecting as it does almost 100 years of proud Australian history. What we are saying is that we on this side of the House do not wish to dictate the terms to the people of Australia. We believe that so important a change should occur only by referendum. That is what we are asking for, that is what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie endorses, and that simple proposition ought to be passed by this House and embraced by the Government. It is its refusal to embrace this very simple, reasonable proposition that makes us so suspicious about what its real agenda might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our flag is a symbol designed to unite our nation in a common cause. If one belongs to a particular religious persuasion, one will know that there are symbols that are a part of every religious group and a part of their worship. If one belongs to a service club, one will know that, whether it is Rotary, Lions or Apex, each of these clubs has a symbol that gives its members an identity as Rotarians, Lions or Apexians. Even more acutely, all of our sporting bodies have symbols so that all of the people know whom they are barracking for, who their team is, and they can be united in a common cause to support that team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our flag is nothing more than a symbol of our national unity. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has pointed out, a competition in which thousands of Australians participated resulted in five people coming up with a common theme, a flag with the Southern Cross dominating it, quite appropriately, and in its top left-hand corner the Union Jack. Are we supposed to apologise because the Union Jack is part of the Australian flag? This Union Jack, this symbol which is so much part of our culture, this flag of the nation that gave us our principles of law, our language and our parliamentary institution, is quite appropriately in the corner of our flag. In 1992, when we celebrate a nation now made up of people who are not just those with English origins but those who have come from all around the globe to be part of the Australian community, is it not appropriate that in the top left-hand corner of our flag there should be a symbol of unity&mdash;the Union Jack, the coming together of the flags of St Andrew, St Patrick and St George? It hardly seems inappropriate to me that that should be part of our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is proposed as an alternative? Should we take away the Union Jack and find some other symbol of Australia? A pie and chips perhaps? Of course we should not. Here we have a flag that for Australians has been a symbol of being Australian. We stand here to defend it and, even more appropriately, to say that it should change only when the majority of Australians want that sort of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of this Parliament, a task we all share, is a task of building a cohesive nation, not a divided one. I would be grateful if that message could be conveyed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). What has been of major concern to me over the last month has not been his emphasis on various economic statements, but rather the way he seems to have gone about dividing the nation, as if he was more at ease being destructive than being constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Prime Minister is to be constructive in bringing the nation together and in encouraging the nation to pull together.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with all of the members of this chamber, I enjoy going to schools and presenting the flag. I would remind the schoolchildren that this flag of ours, this 100-year-old symbol, has flown where Australians have participated in two world wars and in other conflicts. It has been displayed wherever we have proudly been successful in sporting events and it has been there when courageous Australians such as Mawson have undertaken what are literally impossible feats of human endurance in the name of our country. Mawson, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) pointed out, was proud of the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we feel strangely apologetic about a flag that includes the Union Jack symbol? The white on the French flag is a symbol of a monarchy that has been gone from France for 100 years. The red stripes on the flag of the United States are a part of what was once the British red ensign. It may be that we will find our future in South East Asia but our flag is not an impediment to trade&mdash;as the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) has pointed out&mdash;and much more important will be micro-economic reform. I want to conclude with this statement from Mr Anto Santoro:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses serious concern at the overreaction of the banks to their lax lending during the 1980s, and the resulting bad debts, as demonstrated by their being excessively restrictive in their current lending policies; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the banks to review their lending policies and to relax them as far as is commercially appropriate so that the banks resume their normal role of contributing to Australia's economic recovery and national development.</PARA>
<PARA>During the recess I came across a well based, sound small business in my electorate that had applied for an increase in its overdraft from $300,000 to $500,000 and had not been able to get it. It is a high-tech firm which was established in Perth, with branches in several Australian capital cities and with a good record of profit. It had always finished each year with substantial profits&mdash;in the last two, for example, $600,000 before tax in 1989-90 and $300,000 before tax in 1990-91. It had a turnover of $8m a year and it was involved in high value business when it applied for this increase in its overdraft. No trading bank would lend it that money. In the ACT the firm has 25 employees and it has a turnover of $1.5m. When the local branch in the ACT requested an overdraft based on its debtor listing, which was a strong list, it was told it could not get the overdraft it sought. It had a prepayment of $0.75m but that, of course, was assigned to the costs of fulfilling a contract. The bank offered to increase the overdraft of the local branch by $100,000, provided it kept $100,000 on deposit and also provided the directors were prepared to guarantee the loan by mortgaging their own houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really excessively restrictive. This firm is doing well. It is in a growing area of the high-tech market. It depended on an overdraft to expand. It is not in the business of owning property. Yet the bank said it was prepared to increase its lending only if the firm put property in as security. That really means that that particular firm could not expand and was being throttled by the banks which were lending to it. That is just one example of many instances which I understand have occurred in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian businesses, particularly small businesses, are being strangled by a credit squeeze imposed by the banks. This bank imposed credit squeeze was identified by many observers. One, based on careful and comprehensive research by the Bureau of Industry Economics, was released late last year. There is evidence that the squeeze has since grown even worse. Reserve Bank statistics show that credit growth is at its lowest level ever recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look at the statistical record shows that, in the late 1980s, bank lending to business borrowers grew very rapidly, at a rate nearly twice as fast as the growth in deposits. However, the current financial year is likely to reverse that trend dramatically. Bank lending to business borrowers is estimated to expand by a tiny 1 to 2 per cent, so that there is no real growth at all, while deposits this year should expand by more than twice that rate, that is, by over 4 per cent. That means that the banks' resources are being transferred away from business lending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the 1980s, the finance industry has shown the folly of relying simply on self-regulation. With deregulation, the Government gave practically all responsibility for allocating credit to the private sector. What did it do with that responsibility? It went on an irresponsible dash for short term profits which damaged large parts of the Australian economy. Asset prices boomed in an inflationary delusion and then crashed. Credit was mindlessly poured into takeovers, land speculation, empty office blocks and empty resorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, manufacturing and public infrastructure on which our real wealth depends was starved of funds. The current recession has worsened even further the banks' disappointing record of inadequate lending to productive Australian businesses&mdash;businesses which do not shuffle paper but which produce real wealth and productive jobs. This lending cut comes at a time when the big Australian banks are still very profitable and very well capitalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Graham Byrne, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, takes this problem very seriously. He said in February, `The overly-conservative lending practices of the banking community are throttling many struggling small businesses'. He particularly criticises the banks for `the practice of credit lines, such as overdrafts, being reduced or terminated with little or no notice or consultation with the affected small business'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks have been failing small business, which provides nearly half of Australia's private sector employment&mdash;three million workers&mdash;and about one-third of Australia's national income. The bank imposed credit squeeze has exacerbated the already unequal access to finance faced by small businesses in Australia. This unequal access has been long recognised by inquiries such as the 1936 Royal Commission into the Australian Banking and Monetary System from which came, eventually, the Commonwealth Development Bank. Later inquiries such as the 1971 Wiltshire report, the 1981 Campbell report and the 1990 Beddall report have identified a continuing failure of the banks to provide adequate finance to small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks claim that they are not squeezing credit but there is a reduced demand for credit. That is simply not true, as I have illustrated not only by my anecdotal evidence but also by the well-considered comments by the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. The banks are short-sightedly cutting the credit limits of many small businesses. They bear a share of the responsibility for the surge in bankruptcies which is wasting away Australia's employment and export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately the economic statement last week contained some important measures to break the bank imposed credit squeeze. Most importantly the tax treatment and Reserve Bank rules, which discouraged Australian banks from providing equity capital, have been relaxed. Equity investment by Japanese and German banks plays an important part in their role as long term financiers of manufacturing industry. By taking equity, the Australian banks will now have a stake in the future of their business clients. This means the banks will work harder to make the company a success rather than selling it up as soon as it has a set-back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to bank lending by small business is hindered by the banks' oligopoly. Banks have used their market power to give special deals to favoured customers and pass the cost on to smaller customers. This oligopoly power could be reduced by placing the financial sector under public surveillance by, for example, the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has been very successful in reducing inflation, raising business investment and expanding employment, even with the present problems. This success has been supported by the many innovations and improvements the Government has made in the provision of finance and managerial assistance to innovative new firms. This nurturing approach is in stark contrast to the slash and burn policies resulting from the market fetish of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Government we must continue with imaginative and targeted policies. The report into Australia's current account deficit I tabled last October details this approach. We must help to build the new businesses Australia needs to be internationally competitive, and the banks must respond to the Government's new initiative and resume accessible lending to small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I happily second the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). In speaking to the motion, I want to concur with the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Fraser. I believe that he has really gone to the kernel of the matter in relation to the problems that are being faced by business today because of the attitude of the banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only a matter of 10 days ago that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced that the banks are going to take a more generous approach to business in relation to their lending practices. I am pleased that they are saying that, but I have some grave doubts that this is going to come to fruition and I have grave doubts that it is going to apply to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at banking practices in the last three to five years, one can only say the banks have a shocking reputation. They have been implementing their own credit squeeze. In doing so they have been threatening the livelihood of thousands of small business families, and they have been forcing people who normally work in these small businesses onto the dole. I can only sum up by saying that many of their attitudes and practices have been anti-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that they have been implementing their own credit squeeze. You have only to look at what they have been doing in relation to applications that have come before them. They have refused to lend to prospective purchasers of existing small businesses. They have been rejecting applications for finance for new businesses. They are refusing to extend overdrafts to small business proprietors. They are refusing to roll loans over. They are no longer capitalising interest. They are refusing to lend on a number of enterprises such as motels and hotels. They have been calling up loans, even though the borrowers have been performing and are continuing to perform. They are refusing requests for normal balloon repayment schemes. In such schemes one takes a five-year loan and has low principal and interest repayments for, say, the first two years. Then, because of the borrower's greater capacity to repay, the payments are rescheduled and increased. They are refusing those structures. They are holding up overdrafts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks are even continuing to have penalty rates. I had a case only the other day of a fellow paying 16 per cent interest, but then he has a penalty rate of 2 per cent on top of that. They are also using cocktail loans, where people borrow part of the money on overdraft&mdash;in one instance I have here, at 15.5 per cent&mdash;but the other part of the loan, perhaps another $10,000, is at 23 per cent. It is simply unfair, it is anti-Australian, and it is certainly not the sort of practice we expect of Australian banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can add to that that the banks are cancelling the floor plan arrangements for car dealers, they are calling up loans, and they are forcing fire sales of stocks. It is simply not fair to these businessmen who in some cases have been working for decades to build up their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are demanding up to three valuations when a person comes forward wanting to sell his property. I had a case where a bank manager had the local valuation of a motel done and he approved the loan. It then went to a Brisbane manager of the same bank, who had it valued again, against related property in Brisbane, and again approved the loan. It then went before a property finance review committee within that bank, with three people sitting on that committee. They demanded another valuation, which cost the prospective purchaser $4,000. They then refused the loan&mdash;an unbelievable situation, yet that is the sort of thing that goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are breaking down the usual practice of approving a loan in principle if the prospective buyer has met the conditions. Instead they are now forcing borrowers to spend large sums of money before the loan is even approved. It is simply not fair to prospective borrowers or to those who have those businesses. They are almost going back to the 1960 mentality, when it was a common saying, `If a bank will lend you money, you don't need it any more'. It seems that is the case again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of examples I want to bring to the attention of the House. One is of a motel on the Sunshine Coast. The fellow wanted to borrow 52 per cent of the contract price; the valuation was within 0.5 per cent of the contract price. He had sufficient income from the business after wages to service 161 per cent of the principal and interest. He was competent, he was experienced in business&mdash;he had been in business for a long period of time. It was rejected; the reason, he was told&mdash;after all this evaluation&mdash;was that the motel was too old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a distributing business in Brisbane, with government clients. The businessman required $560,000; he was offered only $420,000, even though his assets were twice the amount he wished to borrow. He had first-class real estate security and he had $80,000 cash. His application was rejected and no reason was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that we need to have a hard, hard look at the banks. One could go on with all sorts of cases where they simply will not lend on motels and hotels; they are going against small business people. It is simply causing problems in the economy. They are not playing their part as lenders, as finance providers in this nation, which could help recovery. We should remember that small business employs hundreds of thousands of people. If we want to get this country back on its feet, as this Government is now doing, we need to make sure that small business can borrow the moneys it needs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to join in this debate. I noted that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), suggested that there should be a hard, hard look at the banks. This House, through its Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, has just conducted such an inquiry. It seems that the previous speaker has not read that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this motion before the House should be put into its proper context. It deals with only a very small part of the problem. It would be my view that this motion should be worded along these lines: `That this House expresses serious concern at the failure of the Government to adequately plan and implement the deregulation of the banking industry, resulting from inappropriate monetary policies and Government response to the economic climate of the time; the maintenance of a tax system which encouraged debt; the inadequate reactive rather than proactive prudential supervision of the banks; and the lax lending policies of the banks in the 1980s'. Then the motion could go on with its wish list of saying, `Please, banks, don't let the pendulum swing too far in a direction opposite to that of the 1980s, given that  it went  far  too  lax  in  that period'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may wonder how I can support that argument. Let me quote what was given in evidence from the Reserve Bank to the banking inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic cycles occur for all sorts of reasons including domestic and external factors and shocks, but the banking system is important in both trying to accommodate and to minimise those cycles and to take some of the fluctuation out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here are the critical words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authorities use the banks as the main mechanism through which monetary policy is exercised.</PARA>
<PARA>What, then, were the authorities doing in the 1980s?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they were doing was a consequence of their complete failure to understand the implications of the deregulation of the banking industry. I support its deregulation&mdash;have always supported its deregulation. But one does not deregulate something that has been in a straitjacket for many years, without studying in advance the likely consequences for those involved in the deregulated marketplace and making sure that all the participants are aware of those likely consequences. This Government hastily deregulated the banks, did not think through the likely consequences of it and, as a result of its failure to think them through, its inadequate economic policies during the 1980s, its hopeless tax system in relation to debt and equity during the 1980s, the Government is responsible for what is now occurring in relation to the banks. The banks, too, were not prepared for deregulation. In speeches on the banking committee's report I have said these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deregulation learning curve was a long and slow one. Bankers, regulators and bank customers were ill prepared for the changes which occurred. Even the Reserve Bank, like the Treasury,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for its advice clearly was inadequate, or the Government, having received adequate advice, did not apply it, the latter being the more likely situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">failed to anticipate or comprehend the impact of the forces unleashed by deregulation and their potential to undermine the safety of banks.</PARA>
<PARA>In undermining the safety of banks, through lax lending on their part, great pain and suffering were caused for the very people about whom the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has spoken. It is quite clear that the banks have made strategic mistakes during the 1980s. And it was put this way at a conference on banking held in Sydney earlier this week. Those mistakes included excessive lending to entrepreneurial, real estate and construction companies; a decline in credit standards with risk assessment being clouded by the enticement of high fees and spreads; participation in syndicated loans without applying appropriate credit assessment; and engaging in activities that were not a good fit or which did not have a suitable risk reward ratio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned risk several times, and it is risk that has been the problem. The banks going after profit, which they are entitled to do, blinded themselves by the euphoria of competition and the drive for market share, to a point where they were not assessing the risks related to the loans. And that was not only at the big end of town, it was right across the spectrum of their loan portfolios. What we found was that, in the early 1980s, credit growth as a whole had been between 15.7 per cent and 18.2 per cent up till 1984. Then what happened on deregulation? In 1985 credit growth rose to 23.2 per cent, to a high in 1988 of 28.2 per cent. Of course, there had to be a market correction. As always occurs when there is a market correction, where it has gone too far one way it goes too far the other way, not only in the macro context but also in the micro circumstances of individual borrowers applying to banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks changed their psychology. The bankers did not understand the change nor did their customers. Bankers became marketeers of money, vendors of money, whereas, previously, they had been allocators of rationed funds. The customers went into their banks believing their bankers were their advisers, but the bankers had become salesmen, rather than consultants who could objectively make an assessment of the credibility of the proposition put before them. They wanted to lend their money and they would lend it on high risk ventures. The customer believed that, because the banker would lend the money, the proposition must have been right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fraser and his colleagues spoke as though cocktail loans were new. Cocktail loans existed long before bank deregulation and, in fact, were one of the safety valves as far as customers and banks were concerned, because if one could not get it from the bank out of rationed funds that were lent on a low risk basis, because the risks were higher, one then went to a finance company. One got a risk reward assessment of the proposition and paid in accordance then with the estimated risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since deregulation the Government has failed the Australian people. It failed them because it said that there were advantages to be gained from deregulation&mdash;as there are and there were. But the price that we have paid for that transition from a regulated banking environment to a deregulated one is much higher than it need have been. It is not the banks' fault; it is certainly not wholly their fault. The major people to blame are the members of the Government. The Government did not put in place appropriate economic policies, it did not put in place adequate monetary controls and it did not do what the Reserve Bank said that the authorities normally do, which is to use the banks to moderate cyclical variations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it did not put in place an adequate supervisory arrangement. It is my view that, if there had been in place at the time of deregulation a prudential supervisory regime of the sort that is gradually, far too slowly, coming into operation now, the Reserve Bank would have taken a much more stringent and concerned view about what was going on in the way that banks were increasing their bank assets at a percentage far too good for the health of the banking industry as a whole. To the extent that the banking industry became unhealthy, the people who have borne the burden of that problem are the very persons to whom the honourable member for Fraser has referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, whilst I am concerned about inadequacies within the banking system about lax lending, it is totally wrong for this House to put the whole weight of the blame on the bankers themselves. A very large proportion of that responsibility should be laid at the feet of the very Government that the honourable member for Fraser supports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take issue with the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on one point; that is, that the Government has been successful in reducing interest rates and inflation. Many of us on this side of the House recall that in 1989 and in early 1990, when the former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), was pushing interest rates up through the roof, forcing businesses into bankruptcy and forcing home owners out of their homes, at no stage was a policy objective stated as low inflation and low interest rates. The policy was to soak up consumption&mdash;demand for imports. The effect of the fall in interest rates was as a direct consequence of the recession and not a long term policy objective of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before the House is a classic case of the chicken and the egg. The honourable member for Fraser argues that the banks' restrictive lending policies are prolonging the recession. I would argue, on the basis of my experience in my electorate in Queensland, that the banks' restrictive lending policies are a consequence of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), I was a member of the banking inquiry conducted during the course of 1991. The findings of that inquiry have been well documented, are well known and have also been covered by my colleague. Evidence before the inquiry showed that the banks can be less than proud of their performance in the early years of operation in a deregulated system. Also, bank management was not well prepared when banks moved from an ultra conservative lending practice to entrepreneurial lending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to deregulation, most of such high risk lending, particularly in property development, was carried out by finance companies at higher levels of risk and at higher levels of interest. The expertise in the finance company sector was not transferred to the banking sector, and was not utilised by the banking sector, when it assumed its less conservative and more entrepreneurial role during the course of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of the 1980s of massive accumulated bad debts by the banks is now history. It came about due to rapid asset inflation, as other speakers have said, which in the long term could not be sustained&mdash;leaving the banks dangerously exposed when the recession we had to have finally deflated asset values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the banks respond to economic indicators and policy. The economy does not respond to banking policy. Banks are a business and respond to economic conditions as do other businesses. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) quoted the case of banks refusing to lend to hotels. If you have a look at the economic indicators of retail sales released for the month of December it shows a steady decline in the turnover of retail sales throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poor economic management and forecasting by this Government is directly responsible for the attitude of the banks today. The miscalculations of former Treasurer Keating after the 1987 stock market crash resulted in massive injections of cash and massive injections of credit into the economy and brought about the boom of the late 1980s. Banks, as did other businesses, responded to the boom and the Government's lead by increasing lending, particularly for property development on inflated asset prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer at the time, realising his mistake, put the brakes on the economy by using monetary policy and increasing interest rates. We all know now that the former Treasurer put the brakes on too hard and gave us the worst recession we have had in 60 years. The bad debt book of the banks is now over $30 billion. The recession Treasurer Keating engineered increased rapidly and sharply the exposure of banks to bad debts as asset prices tumbled and security of lending diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the banks reacted sharply to economic management. Of course the banks are applying stricter lending conditions today. Of course banks are moving to reduce their risk exposure. Banks, like all other businesses, have lost confidence due to the recession. But the ball is in the Government's court. It is in the honourable member for Fraser's court. If the Government is prepared to take the tough decisions that are necessary, the banks will respond. Those decisions are in the Fightback package, they are not in its One Nation statement. It is hoping to kick-start the economy, but I am saying that a kick-start will not work when there is no petrol left in the tank. There is no confidence left in the business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House supports the request of the Isolated Children's Parents' Association for a significant increase in the Assistance for Isolated Children allowance as a matter of urgency, particularly in view of the rapidly deteriorating economic circumstances prevailing throughout regional Australia and the collapse in the real value of the allowance in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA>Notice of this motion was given by me in October of last year, and I thank the Government for accepting it. It was given at a time, I might add, when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had commented in its editorial that if Australia was in a recession, then rural Australia was undoubtedly in a fully fledged depression. So the situation out there is extraordinarily serious and is acknowledged to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the question of education assistance for children in the isolated parts of Australia, I believe that I must initially seek to dispel two particular myths which seem very hard to get rid of. The first is that assistance for isolated children, or the AIC scheme, is not some sort of hand-out designed to benefit mainly wealthy graziers so that they can more readily send their children to expensive boarding schools in the big cities. In fact, a wide range of families from isolated parts of this vast and very thinly populated land need access to educational facilities for their children. They include not only farmers, and not only graziers who are by no means wealthy at the moment in the current environment, but also property managers, farm workers, miners, outback shopkeepers, fuel suppliers and so forth&mdash;even lighthouse attendants. A whole range of people in isolated situations in this country need access to schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and I think this is very important to understand, we are not talking here about welfare benefits. Rather, we are talking about access to education, and the very important principle that all Australian children should enjoy the same opportunity to get to the school gate. An example used by the ICPA itself to illustrate the point is that of a Newcastle family, perhaps unlucky enough to fall victim to that terrible earthquake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though their home could be flattened and their car written off and water and gas could be disconnected, with the resulting financial mayhem, the fact is that mum and dad can still put the kids on the school bus, which will take them off for the day in order that they can enjoy access to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it makes no difference at all whether that family are welfare dependent, at one end of the spectrum, or are wealthier citizens of Newcastle, at the other; access to school is provided on an equal basis. This is not the case for isolated Australians. So far as it is possible to correct the situation, we as a nation must seek to do so, both for reasons of simple justice and fairness and for economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justice argument is simple enough. As I have said, all Australian children should have that essential opportunity for an adequate education. If there is no place for them in the bush, they need to be given the skills, the abilities and the capabilities to have an equal footing with their peers from urban areas, from populated areas, to enter the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic argument is also highly significant. The fact is that a great deal of Australia's export wealth is disproportionately generated by people who live outside the heavily populated areas of Australia. We have a vested interest as a nation in keeping people out there in those mining areas and agricultural areas. It needs to be kept in mind that educated people will, as a rule of thumb, be more productive people&mdash;the evidence is quite clear on that point&mdash;and that families will not stay in areas where they cannot educate their children. That means that they will not remain productive in those areas, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIC scheme was first set up in 1973. Originally, it funded 55 per cent of average boarding costs for children. At its peak, some 32,000 children were being assisted, at a cost of some $28m. Today, however, only around 12,000 are receiving assistance, at a cost of around $14m to $15m. The annual decline in numbers is of the order of 1,000 children, which, I imagine, reflects in no small part the already very worrying level of exodus from the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years from 1973 the base allowance slipped away from that level of 55 per cent of average boarding costs to a low of just 21 per cent, in the face of consistent inflation&mdash;the great cancer that this Government refused to properly address, let alone acknowledge, until it landed us in a recession or, can I say, a depression in the bush and it became convenient to point towards broken inflation as a big plus. As Max Walsh pointed out, inflation always is low in a depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago the Government, to its credit, increased the base boarding allowance to the non-means and non-assets tested portion to $1,500, which brought its value back up to 32 per cent of average boarding costs. Then, in the first of many lifts from our Fightback package, the Government increased the base to $2,500, or 51 per cent of average boarding costs. That was done just before Christmas. That very considerable improvement is greatly appreciated by isolated families; they commend the Government for it and so do I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, more help is needed. The total amount available to those in need who pass the means test and claim the second tier or, as it is known, the additional boarding allowance was increased by just $150 to $3,354; that is to say, all isolated children as defined receive the base boarding allowance of $2,500 and, if they are eligible, some additional $850 is made available, to a ceiling of $3,354. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with that is that most of those in deepest need were already able to claim that much before the increase in the base. They are no further ahead now than they were before the increase was announced before Christmas. If they are ahead, it is only by the order of $150-odd. That needs to be contrasted with the average boarding cost across Australia, which is now some $4,969 per student per year. In New South Wales, for example, State boarding schools charge $5,550 per year, and in Western Australia the Government hostels charge $4,900 per year. Probably it needs to be kept in mind as well that about 80 per cent of children cannot access these State boarding facilities in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some unknown reason, the maximum allowance is apparently tied to the maximum level in Austudy&mdash;the Austudy living at home allowance rate, which does seem to me to be totally irrelevant. Firstly, most of these children are not able to stay at home&mdash;that is precisely the point. Secondly, Austudy is an income support scheme designed to help kids stay at school, whereas the AIC is a mechanism to enable children to get to the school gate, to give them access to educational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major stumbling block remains, inasmuch as the assets test on the additional boarding allowance remains. We have committed ourselves to abolishing that because it is an anomaly, and it does have a very restrictive effect on the availability of this aid for isolated children. It is obviously not a fair test. A city family left without income can still access local schools on free, or very low cost, school buses and trains, regardless of the value of their assets. Therefore, isolated families should be freed of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation is, as I have mentioned, quite desperate out there. While acknowledging the Government's moves in the right direction, the Isolated Children's Parents Association has requested that, firstly, the base boarding allowance plus the additional boarding allowance should be adjusted so that they meet the full average boarding cost per student&mdash;at least for families on zero or negative incomes. This enables them to get their children to the school gate&mdash;nothing more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, they would like the assets test lifted on AIC school access allowances and continued through to year 12. In addition, they would like some attention to Austudy availability for isolated school students, and to the unrealistic levels of the correspondence allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost of these measures would be somewhere around $20m, which is chickenfeed when set against both the current and potential wealth generation capacity of isolated Australia. It is also cheap social justice. It should be kept in mind that it still would constitute something like a $7m saving on the 1987 cost of the scheme; that saving results from the lower number of children who are estimated to need aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend this motion to the House and I join with the ICPA in urging the adoption of these urgently needed measures to avoid further escalation in the already tragically high numbers of isolated children being withdrawn from education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion, I must commend the Isolated Children's Parents Association. Under the circumstances&mdash;difficult circumstances&mdash;it has done a magnificent job, and as a lobby group it has been very effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance to isolated children was, in fact, brought in in 1973 when there were 32,000 recipients. It was brought in by the Whitlam Government. At that time, the allowance made to children was about 55 per cent of the average boarding costs. By December 1990, there were 12,948 isolated children and there would be even fewer today. I think those figures themselves tell a story, for this motion goes far beyond just the content of the motion. It gets to the heart of what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Australia is in great danger of dividing as a nation. At a time when there is talk about unity, we have a situation where we are having people in the country&mdash;an area where most of Australia's wealth is still generated from&mdash;in danger of becoming second-class citizens. The city is becoming affluent and the country is becoming more prone to poverty. This is an untenable situation; it is a situation that will divide this nation. I believe it has to be addressed. I think the Government is to be commended for increasing the non-means tested allocation to isolated children to $2,500. It has once again restored it to about 55 per cent of boarding costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mainly want to speak about the non-means tested section, because I do not think it is clearly understood what we are about. There are two issues. One is access to schools. Every student in Australia should have access; and in my view it should be equal access. The other issue is income support. Parents in the country have the problem of getting education for their children. They have to bear a cost which is not borne by people in the cities. Therefore I think the non-means tested allocation should be the full average boarding cost across Australia. That would work out to a shade under $5,000, and I would be quite happy to round it off to $5,000. The payment of that amount would restore some access and equity to the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the truth is that the richest people in Australia can send their children to school in the cities of Australia for virtually nothing. The richest people in Australia living in the country face considerable costs. The richest people can obviously afford it, but there are many people in the bush who simply cannot. The figures from ABARE indicate that in this current financial year 30 per cent of primary producers will have a negative income. There is a very grave danger that those people will withdraw their children from school. Their children's education will therefore suffer at a time when we are trying to build a clever country. If we are going to have a clever country we need to have clever people in those industries which are vital to Australia. There are no industries more vital to Australia today than the mining and the agricultural industries&mdash;the very industries that are threatened by the cost of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits are considerable. If the education of these children were improved, it would mean that with increased efficiency in rural areas and an increasing decline in population, they would be equipped to get jobs in the cities. It would mean that if they stayed on the land they would be more efficient in their production of the export income that Australia desperately needs. It seems strange to me that, when the cost of providing this equity is so small, we do not do more about it. As the previous speaker said, if we were to grant the ICPA its entire wish list it would come to about $20m, or some $7m less than it would have cost in 1987. That would be $20m that would be very well spent. It would do more to help restore equity and unity to this nation than virtually any other expenditure I can think of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a lot of experience of isolated education. My brother's children were brought up on the School of the Air throughout primary school, and the education standard is very good. They have no trouble competing in conventional schools at an academic level, but they do have problems with social intercourse. I notice in my brother's children, even today, a shyness and a reluctance to meet people. We ought to be investing a lot more in isolated education. We ought to be using some of the funds that are poured into education to assist with more trips for these isolated kids, and to give them more ability to mix with their peers in regular schools. This would prove a great benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is anything particularly controversial in this proposal. As I have said, it was in fact the Labor Government that introduced it. It is the Labor Government that has raised the allowances. I am glad to see that this is being supported by the National Party and the Liberal Party. I hope that when the Government is framing the Budget it looks to implementing some needed reform in this area. We have pressures in Australia&mdash;and it was discussed in this place this morning&mdash;emanating from what I call the multicultural industry. While it costs Australia uncounted billions of dollars for people who are seeking to divide this country with a philosophy that Australia does not want, we are neglecting the simple areas where equity can be restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of confusion between the assistance for isolated children and Austudy. Austudy is about income support. It should be totally independent of any assistance to isolated children. Any assistance to isolated children should not be counted when looking at Austudy calculations. As I have said, all that the assistance for isolated children does is provide them with entry to the school gate. We have not yet got to full compensation. I certainly hope that we can move in that direction. The costs vary considerably across Australia. I am told that at the convent in Quilpie a child can board for something like $2,900 a year. That sounds rather austere. In Western Australia, the average cost for government boarding schools is about $4,900. In New South Wales it is somewhat higher, but that seems to be an average figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are simply not enough hostels and they are not located strategically enough to cover all isolated children. We must be flexible in the construction of these hostels and we must realise that there is always going to be a demand or a need for children to attend schools in the cities. This is not about giving handouts to the rich, to the squattocracy; this is about simple equity&mdash;providing education to children on an equal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that it is going to become increasingly important for Australia to do better in those areas in which it does well. We are going to have to look at downstream processing of a lot of our minerals. It is likely that we will even see an increase in the number of children requiring this assistance. That is something that the country should not baulk at or shy away from. As a nation, if we are going to have unity, we must have equity in the system, and equity is certainly overdue to these people. I have heard it said on many occasions, `If you do not like it in the country, why do you not move to the city?'. If everyone did that, the economy of this country would crumble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, in the past, mining companies have adopted the rather macho attitude that people who work in export producing industries are somehow more important than people in other industries. That is nonsense. We certainly cannot convince the people who are driving buses around some of our cities that they are not working very hard. In fact, they are working harder than many people. What we should realise is that work in the country produces lots of jobs in the city. If city people can be taught how much their jobs, their employment, and the affluence in the cities rest on people who develop things in the country, then I believe we will be well on the way to giving the sort of justice to country people that is long overdue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who in his contribution talked about justice and fairness. It seems to me that, when we talk about this issue of assistance for isolated children, we talk about not an issue of access but one of equity. There is a lack of equity because we cannot afford to build primary schools, secondary schools and tertiary institutions through the outback of this great and vast nation. Any support of equity demands that we support those families who inhabit the vast regions of Australia, who contribute to our wealth and contribute to our social cohesion, as a matter of equity, by making sure that their children can afford to go to school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the Government and congratulate it for its initiative at Christmas time in increasing the base allowance for isolated children. I am not sure that the Government has gone far enough, as the secondary portion of the allowance has not been increased by more than 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that in March of this year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, in bringing down a report into student financial assistance, recommended to the Government that it increase the portion of the assistance to isolated children allowance that is not subject to the means and assets test. That was in March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to bring to the House's attention the fact that in November the Opposition, in its financial package called Fightback, also offered to increase the base portion of the allowance. The Opposition went further and said that the secondary portion of the allowance should be means tested but not assets tested, that it should in fact be assets test free. It is interesting, but not funny, that DEET advises us that in 1990-91 the expenditure on AIC was $15.5m, $0.824m less than the appropriation, because both the average benefit and the number of students assisted were less than had been estimated. That was so, I would maintain, because of a deep recession and because of country people leaving country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the assets test is questionable on equity grounds. For the children of parents who live a long way away from all three levels of schooling, both assistance for isolated children and Austudy are a matter of means but not a matter of assets. One might own several hundred thousand square miles and not have a cracker to be able to afford to send one's children to school, or afford even the correspondence course. It is my view that the assets test in this instance is not equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this year the Department's form 9 caused many families in the bush a great deal of trouble. Form 9 is really quite obtrusive. If you want to obtain assistance through the AIC program or if you apply for Austudy, for most farm families the filling out of this form is likely to require the assistance of an accountant and therefore further expense at a time when the families have little or no income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Isolated Children's Parents Association makes the point that it was an isolated child who discovered the Chinese boat people wandering around the Top End of Australia this past year. Where the Government and the military surveillance failed to find these people wandering free in our nation, it was an isolated child who found them. The families who inhabit the vast regions of this country are important to our economy, they are an important part of our infrastructure and they play a very important role in Australian society. As a matter of equity, we must support the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that all members of parliament who represent country electorates and regional electorates have been conscious of and have been pressing for. It has come back to a matter of funds, but this Government has acted in providing another $8.6m to underpin these costs and to ensure that young people in isolated areas can get to school. I agree that there is always need for more, because even $2,500 is not very much when one is trying to send a person of 15 or 16 off to secondary school. It is not very much when one realises that there are income tests on the additional living allowance. </PARA>

Whilst the honourable member for La Trobe talks about assets tests, it needs to be placed on the record that this Government is conscious of the problems that he mentioned about someone owning so many hundreds of square miles of land but having no income, because only half the value of the asset is taken into consideration. Also, there are times when the assets test is not even considered. Under the rural adjustment scheme, if a rural family is on a pension, then there are special exemptions again. So the Government is conscious of the problems. This has been seen in the fact that these latest increases are going to benefit some 8,500 students across Australia. That is about 65 per cent of all the students receiving assistance under the isolated children's scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that I see concern those who are not on the land. Many of my constituents, who work for local authorities, who work as fettlers, really are caught up in earning a little more than the $20,700, which is the income test level, but do not have assets. They do not have the capacity to go to the bank and say, `I have got $500,000 worth of land: what can I borrow?'. These are ordinary people who are caught up in the same sort of problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst they are able to get that extra allowance in some cases, it is income tested up to $3,300; and there is a need to review that. There is also a need to review the distance criteria and the general problems in children living away, because $50 a week simply is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for what it has done. A shift from $1,500 to $2,500 is praiseworthy. The Opposition is acknowledging that, the organisation is acknowledging that and the families are acknowledging that, but we do need to reconsider the situation further. There are real problems in geographical isolation. There are real problems when families are trying to eke out an existence working in those small isolated areas. I have in my electorate towns such as St Lawrence, 150 kilometres from Mackay and 105 kilometres from Rockhampton, virtually in the middle of nowhere, which are facing major problems. Many of these people work for local authorities; they work in the council areas; they work on properties. But they do not have the assets to go and borrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for what it is doing and for what it is trying to do to equal up the situation to ensure that these young people are able to get an education. But we need to ensure that we monitor it further. There is a review going at the moment; there is an options paper out. I would hope that the special problems faced by the low income families in these areas are also acknowledged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to express a grievance on behalf of my constituents, the constituents of the Gold Coast, but I divert for one minute to refer to a radio program I heard this morning on the subject of Canberra. It was a local Canberra radio program, of course, on which both Geoffrey Blainey and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) were interviewed and gave views on the current controversy of Canberra being bagged by a journalist from another State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gist of the program was that Canberra residents are resentful of being referred to as `Canberra', as though it is synonymous with the Federal Government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are doing it extremely hard on the Gold Coast, a matter about which I will be expressing my grievance very shortly. They are very badly hurt by this Government's policies. Canberra residents really need to understand that they are not alone in this stereotyping. They ought also to understand that they are as guilty as anyone else in Australia in stereotyping other areas of Australia. It is, after all, Canberra residents who advise this Government on disbursements of funds. As somebody who represents the Gold Coast, I have said several times in this House that I resent the stereotyping of my constituents on the Gold Coast as wealthy spivs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to say that to a certain extent Canberra brings it on itself. There is no better measure of this than its voting patterns. For example, in 1990 the coalition actually gained a majority of the vote Australia-wide but did not gain a majority of seats. However, the vote in Canberra was out of kilter with trends in the rest of Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those 1990 election results came out, I was reminded of what happened in the United States of America in 1984 when President Reagan was running for re-election and he was opposed by a previous Vice-President of the United States, Walter Mondale. Mondale carried the vote in only two parts of the United States, his home state of Minnesota and Washington, DC. Given that the vote was so far out of kilter with the rest of the United States of America, a friend of mine, who is American, said that he found it fairly depressing to think that the policy-makers in Washington, DC, could be so far out of step with the sentiment and feelings of virtually the rest of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unfortunate fact that voting patterns throw up exactly the same pattern here in Australia. Canberra's voting patterns are out of step with the rest of Australia. When one lives and represents an area such as I do, an area which is itself prone to stereotyping, it becomes all the more depressing because that attitude of certain Canberra residents towards people who are resident on the Gold Coast shows up with depressing regularity in correspondence that I receive from various Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gold Coast is stereotyped as wealthy and, on occasions, some of that wealth having been earned in questionable ways. There are a large number of wealthy people on the Gold Coast. There are two good reasons: first, it is the best part of Australia to live so that, when people get the opportunity to retire, it is their number one choice for retirement and quite a number of wealthy people take their retirement wealth to the Gold Coast. The second thing is that it is a beautiful place to visit, and probably the most desirable place to live is either on the beach front or on the riverfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourists go to the Gold Coast and they walk on the beaches and they see some conspicuous consumption by the local residents. They go for boat cruises and, similarly, they see the beautiful mansions that are on the riverbank. But people forget that they can go to Sydney and see wondrous mansions on Sydney Harbour and not see the western suburbs of Sydney or Redfern or other places such as that. There is conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast and it is very apparent. But all objective factual measures indicate that that is totally atypical of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recently had a census done and I am looking forward to the analysis by electorates of the various statistics that usually come out of a census. The 1986 pattern showed that the residents of the two Federal electorates of Moncrieff and McPherson, for example, ranked amongst the lowest in Australia in average household income. The stereotype of wealth is not borne out by that basic statistic. However, the statistics show a few other very important facts about the Gold Coast. They show that the residents of the two Gold Coast electorates have the fewest number of government employees as a percentage of their work force. In other words, we are not pork-barrelled by government, either State or Federal. The wealth and the jobs that are created locally are created by private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics also show that employees there basically work in small business. We have the highest proportion of all Federal electorates of people either self-employed or working for small enterprises. So the Gold Coast is very much small business driven. That is against the stereotype of the five-star hotels which are very important employers. However, in the sense that they are significant employers, and one hopes that is a part of the economy that will grow because they bring in tourists who spend a lot of money and the benefits flow, they are atypical of the pattern of employment and of industry on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have basically a tourism industry and a small business economy, we have a very low-paid work force. A very large proportion of the work force works in retailing and in tourism, which are two areas of relatively low pay. The fact is that many people who live on the Gold Coast are retirees who are self-funded, pensioners, or living on very modest superannuation. That brings with it very particular needs, and an area of need which is becoming acute is that of aged care and the health needs of the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very recently the local State regional health authority released a report which tipped a huge bucket on both the State Government and the Federal Government for the underfunding of health care in the Gold Coast region. Just a little while ago I wrote a letter to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in which I pointed out that the Blue Nursing Service on the Gold Coast, despite having to cope with nearly twice as many cases as allowed for by the level of funding that was struck back in 1984, is getting no more money. The Minister in his reply said that in the area of aged care he was looking at the capacity of people to look after themselves, and not just the raw data. He did not go on to say, `Mrs Sullivan, you come from the Gold Coast and we all know everybody is dripping wealth there. What about their paying for their own aged care?', but the whole tone of the letter implied that. </PARA>

I would like to tell the people of Canberra, who are very influential in government policy, to cut out the stereotypes and to go and look at the facts. They should not be happy when innocent Canberra residents are resentful of the stereotype, but work to overcome the effects of the stereotype and how it affects people who live in my part of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, because my time is nearly expired, I have to say that the figures will also show that the most rapid growth in youth unemployment in Australia is on the Gold Coast. It is not the stereotyped surfie dole bludger; not at all. It is local young people who can no longer turn to the traditional small business employer for jobs. Certainly the tourism industry is still doing well, and it is an important employer of young people. But the second area, and a far more significant area traditionally, is that of small business. Small business is collapsing at a record rate on the Gold Coast, because people are frightened of the future. Many people are unemployed, many people's neighbours have become unemployed, and they have become frightened of what that means. Small business is going bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad indeed that the best the Prime Minister can bring to this Parliament and to the office of Prime Minister is the old, tired, worn-out Labor stereotype of class warfare. It is a stereotype which has served this nation badly, and it is serving my constituents particularly badly. This is a time, indeed, for one nation, and not for setting one group against another, and that will only be done when the facts are looked at objectively and are judged on their merits. If that were happening, the aged and the young in my electorate would not find themselves in the extreme difficulties they have at the moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the oldest tricks in the book is to blame someone for something he did not do. Over the past few days we have seen the Opposition in this Parliament doing this in regard to the Treasury's analysis of its so-called Fightback program. It is also a ploy used in industrial relations, as employers try to portray the workers of Australia as wreckers of the Australian economy. This always gets the union bashers opposite very excited as they rush to criticise the workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representing, as I do, the Illawarra region, I am well aware of industrial disputes&mdash;especially disputes involving the Big Australian, whose record in industrial relations would not be a case study of how to run industrial relations successfully. There will always be disputes in a major industrial area like the Illawarra, but disputes brought on by the obstinacy of BHP are usually distorted. BHP usually stops short of deliberate lying, being prepared to mislead or confuse; but recently it engaged in a campaign of deliberate lying to discredit local unions, especially the South Coast Labour Council and its secretary, Paul Matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Coast Labour Council took a principled stand on the Dili massacre and engaged in some picketing of a ship loading steel for Indonesia late last year. On 3 January the following press release was issued by BHP:</PARA>

<PARA>Not surprisingly, the local media ran strongly with the story, as indeed did the national media. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, in Brisbane, was especially critical in an editorial calling on the ACTU and the Federal Government to discipline the South Coast Labour Council. Quoting from BHP International Marketing Manager, David Burgess, who said such things as that Krakatau had been forced to switch to an alternative supplier, Illawarra industry and commerce leaders seized on the BHP statement to condemn the South Coast Labour Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were the usual personal attacks on Paul Matters by those apologists for the conservatives, the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Manufactures. One failed Liberal candidate by the name of Warren Steel, now Secretary of the Wollongong Chamber of Commerce, even publicly boasted that Paul Matters should be run out of town. He said, quoting from a telephone call he got, `Can't someone take him out and dump him at sea?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chamber President, Malcolm Heard, called on rank and file members to dump Paul Matters. Most statements were made with malicious intent. There was an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> and various heavies were asked to comment. The local Federal members, aware of BHP's reputation, did not comment. But Senator Michael Baume, who bills himself as Liberal senator for Wollongong&mdash;although I must say that no-one ever sees him in Wollongong&mdash;went on his usual union bashing tirade, as did the shadow Minister for Trade, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Indeed, from Brisbane to Adelaide the South Coast Labour Council was condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find? We find that a little bit of investigative journalism by the local ABC revealed that the Big Australian had been up to its old trick of telling the big lie once more, despite the fact that Paul Matters had consistently stated that industrial action had not lead to the loss of any steel contracts to Indonesia. It took a telex from Krakatau Steel to prove the point. The telex referred to a fax as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Krakatau Steel did not cancel the contract with BHP to buy 32,000 steel from Port Kembla.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Approximately 30,000 steel was shipped from Port Kembla on December 30, 1991 and arrived at Krakatau Steel . . . on January 15, 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.An official from BHP came to Indonesia in December 1991 and clarified the matter. He stated that apparently an incorrect statement had been issued in Australia by an unauthorised BHP personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.Both Krakatau Steel and BHP Australia are willing to continue their business cooperation now and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>This was signed and sent by a Mr Ariwibowo, who is not only President of Krakatau Steel but also Indonesia's junior Industry Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the lie was proven, what do we find? What was Mr Burgess's response when he was found out to be lying? What was the man, who claimed that BHP had lost an $8m contract in January, now saying? He suddenly became very silent. This man  Burgess, who said, `The loss of the contract was a blow for the Illawarra', when it was proven that he had deliberately lied, had no comment. The big lying Australian BHP said the matter was closed. BHP Port Kembla Manager, Graham Parker, has refused to respond to local media inquiries. He said that the matter was closed and nothing could be gained from further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BHP should apologise to the local trade union movement. So should all those others so quick to jump on the union bashing bandwagon. Burgess should be sacked for deliberately lying to the Illawarra people and the media. We can speculate why BHP has lied. This lie would have been accepted had it not been for the work of the local ABC journalists in the Illawarra, especially Julie Persetti and Kerry O'Connor, who read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Review</EMPHASIS> about this matter and followed it through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we know that BHP will not upset Indonesia as it hopes to profit from oil in the Timor Gap. But, far from gaining favour with Indonesia, this lie by BHP has embarrassed Indonesia. It is not that it was a mistake&mdash;it was a deliberate lie. According to Krakatau Steel, an official from BHP visited Indonesia in late December. Indonesia at that stage indicated that it had not cancelled any steel order. Why then did BHP put out a press statement, on 3 January 1992, saying that, because of militant union activity, it had lost an $8m steel contract? It did this for one reason and one reason alone: it was an exercise in union bashing. It was an attempt to portray the union in the worst possible light as a wrecker of Illawarra jobs. It was an especially vindictive attack on the Secretary of the South Coast Labour Council, Paul Matters. As Paul Matters has said, BHP's decision to blame the union for the loss of Krakatau's interest in the steel contract was nothing more than a propaganda exercise. That is what it was, a propaganda exercise. Like all propaganda, it is based on lies. Perhaps we can add another name to the Big Australian&mdash;the Big Australian as the big liar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are hearing a lot today about buy Australian and be Australian and Australian made and so on. I direct a few remarks to points that appear to me as a grievance with regard to the need for us to be more Australian and, by looking back on our colourful Australian heritage, to find out a little bit more about how we can be more Australian. Of course, to look back over our history, we have a period that is called our `wild colonial days'. This is equal to and, in many ways, surpasses that of nearly every other country in the world. Unfortunately, this period is almost totally ignored by our education system and by many bodies which ought to be doing more about bringing it to the attention of the Australian people. I have in my electorate a very colourful, well known and excellent historian, Edgar Penzig, who gets a lot of help from his wife, Megan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, hundreds and thousands of school children seem unaware that mail was carried overland by horseback between Melbourne and Yass, before it finished the trip by coach, and this was 23 years before the American pony express began operations in the early 1860s. Australia had the richest goldfields, especially of the alluvial type, ever found in the world. Likewise, we had the largest pure gold nugget and the largest quartz-gold nugget, the Beyers-Holtermann nugget, found at Hill End in New South Wales. We had towns with larger populations and many more hotels than any in the so-called American Wild West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the American Wild West outlaws take a back seat to the local variety, which were known as bushrangers. For instance, Jesse James in the American Wild West committed 21 hold-ups in 16 years, whereas our notorious bushranger John Gilbert, nicknamed Happy Jack, committed over 630 robberies in just over four years. The villain Ben Hall committed over 600 robberies, as did many others, such as Morgan the Murderer and Fred Ward, alias Thunderbolt. All honourable members, and especially the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), would know all about Thunderbolt's history. All those bushrangers had tallies of several hundred. As for Ned Kelly, his tally was only about a dozen. If he had not put that tin over his head, we probably would not even have heard of him again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the American Western period several people carried five revolvers, a few dozen carried two and the majority carried one. One can compare this with John Gilbert, Ben Hall and company, who were always armed with six or eight. In one hold-up Hall had nine pistols and revolvers in his belt. No American outlaw ever held up a whole town, but the Gilbert-Hall gang held up three country towns during their infamous careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coaching history of our country also surpasses all others. In the early 1870s, every day Cobb and Co. was putting 6,000 horses into harness and its coaches were travelling 28,000 miles every week. Mr Penzig points out that miles is the proper language. That local firm was the largest of its kind in the world. It was larger than Wells Fargo and the Adam Express Co. of the United States put together. On top of that, we had the largest coaches in the world. The biggest in America's west carried 36 passengers, which is not a bad load for a coach, whilst the Australian model, of which two were made, built in about 1860, were pulled by 22 horses and weighed in at 5 tons&mdash;not tonnes, as Mr Penzig points out. They carried 89 passengers and were the largest horse-drawn vehicles ever constructed in the world. </PARA>

All the teenagers and, unfortunately, many adults are using that word because of the influence of television in every home. The mudguards on all our motor cars are turning into fenders overnight. What was the bonnet of the motor car ever since the car was invented has, over the years, turned into a hood. All our headmasters during the same span of time have turned into American principals.

One of the terms we have used ever since the 1850s is the goods train, but in the past two years we have begun to hear from newsreaders and to read in our papers `freight train'.

Not only does the boree-log sound just as good, but it is Australian, it is ours. So no more Yankee barbeques; let us have more boree-logs. </PARA>

We used to put petrol into our motor cars, but many petrol stations now advertise gas. For the uninformed, petrol is a liquid, not a gas. Instead of wearing moleskins, which will outlast 10 pairs of Yankee jeans, every Australian youth and many adults wear the latter. Even one of our leading country entertainers, who continually talks about Australia getting a new flag and becoming a republic, always appears at his concerts and public appearances wearing a denim shirt, jeans and striped jogging boots.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you wish, Madam Deputy Speaker. I withdraw it. The National Party, in my couple of years in this place, has shown itself to be absolutely incapable of effectively putting the views of country people. That absolute inability is shown very effectively by the lack of performance in the production of the Opposition's Fightback program. That program has absolutely no initiatives that are likely to be of advantage to country and rural people, or the people of my electorate on the north coast. The National Party really needs to comprehend the types of people who make up its electorates. It has not done this and it has been snowballed by the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party, which represents the wealthy city electorates, has dominated the Fightback statement. The National Party members have lain down like dogs and allowed themselves and their electorates to be crushed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, when we examine the proposals and the initiatives of the One Nation program we find many initiatives that are of real and direct benefit to the people of the north coast of New South Wales and to rural and country people throughout Australia. The National Party really needs to understand how its electorates are composed, and the sorts of categories that its constituents fall into. My electorate, which would not be very different from many National Party electorates, is made up predominantly of low income earners. It comprises families on low incomes, pensioners and elderly people, small business people, with the emphasis on `small', and small farmers&mdash;once again with the emphasis on `small'. What has the National Party done? It has agreed to a stance that favours the rich at the expense of the low to middle income earners of Australia&mdash;the very people who make up its constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document demonstrates some very interesting facts which will be of great interest to the members of my electorate and to the members of all country electorates. Under the Fightback program, 70 per cent of wage and salary earners would be worse off; 60 per cent of the self-employed and farmers would be worse off. Those figures would be even worse for my electorate because those wage and salary earners and those self-employed people and farmers by and large fall into the low income earners category at a greater rate than they do in other electorates. </PARA>

That same group, with incomes up to $57,000 a year, would be worse off by $400 a year. Self-employed and farmers with incomes up to $61,000 would be worse off by $600 a year. Taxpayers with incomes up to $30,000 a year would be worse off by $10 a week. While at the other end of the scale, people paying tax on $100,000 would be better off by over $70 a week. </PARA>

The Federal National Party people should be saying to the Leader of the Liberal Party that the $1.1 billion spent on infrastructure on the roads and rails that will rebuild this country are of direct benefit to country and rural people. In particular, north coast people have suffered from the cuts to rail services and many other services made by the Greiner State Government.

This initiative gives those businesses and those farmers the opportunity to trade out of their problems and will assist in maintaining their viability in the long term. The additional funding to export marketing programs should be shown by National Party members to the Leader of the Liberal Party as an initiative that will assist many small businesses in rural areas to take up export opportunities. Many rural businesses will be able to gain access to export markets through the initiatives of the One Nation program. That is good, but in contrast the Professor is to cut spending in that area by $175m. </PARA>

While they are at it, they should be asking their own leader why he has not fought for the interests of country people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing new about the grievance I wish to vent on behalf of the people of Robertson today. It is a perennial problem which my duty to my constituents demands be constantly brought to the attention of this Parliament. I refer to the recurrent urban flooding suffered by many thousands of people on the central coast of New South Wales. When the good folk of Nyngan and other towns along the Murray-Darling system faced flooding, the eyes of the nation were focused upon them. Wide media coverage and visits by our nation's leaders were orders of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, this sort of flooding normally occurs once or twice a decade, and usually affects only a couple of thousand citizens. In Robertson, severe flooding has become a way of life. Some 8,000 of my constituents get flooded each and every year. Some are inundated as many as three times in a year. They suffer exactly the same destruction of their houses, as floodwaters destroy floor coverings and furniture and put their lives at risk, as well as the lives of their loved ones. Very little notice is taken of this widespread devastation because it happens so often. Regrettably it is no longer news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 and 10 February last, a severe rain storm following two days of soaking rain caused devastating flooding in Narara and Erina Creeks. Flood levels were higher on Narara Creek than they have been recorded in living memory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indications are that the flood on the Narara Creek considerably exceeded the one per cent AEP flood levels between Haggerty Close at Narara and Dignity Crescent at West Gosford. The industrial area of North Gosford in Brooks Avenue suffered badly with indications of more than 1 metre. Night shift workers at the Angel Pie Co. were given only moments notice of the onrush and were forced to swim to higher ground in water infested with leeches and snakes. Their cars were submerged in the car park. Management lost thousands of dollars in lost product, ingredients, production and damage to machinery. The Gosford City bowling lanes are a total loss with a full rebuilding program necessary. In the Showground Road area the water level in houses was well above the windows. The West Gosford industrial properties between Manns Road and Narara Creek suffered similar damage. The Tascott Basin and Point Clare area also suffered similar damage with Brisbane Water Drive cut for a considerable period and many houses flooded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the main township of Gosford, floodwaters entered many commercial properties up to three metres deep between Carbow Arcade and Burns Place. Flood liable areas at Erina along Barralong Road, Winani Road, Lingi Street and Nerissa Road experienced a flood of approximately 10 per cent AEP magnitude. All areas normally flooded suffered yet again. Rainfall figures indicate that the rain falling on Narara Creek exceeded one per cent AEP design figures</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The torrential rain the following weekend also caused severe flooding in the Narara and Erina Creek areas and resulted in substantial damage to the city's road network. Council staff were kept busy dealing with numerous emergency calls reporting damage and seeking assistance. Substantial damage to road shoulders and major scouring occurred along Brisbane Water Drive with localised flooding of properties. Similar damage occurred at Empire Bay, Green Point, Copacabana, Woy Woy, Pearl Beach and Umina. Road closures were required at various sites in Gosford including Showground Road, Avoca Drive, Terrigal Drive, Brunswick Road and the Pacific Highway at West Gosford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of the storms were also felt in the Mangrove Mountain area with numerous trees being brought down and major scouring of unsealed roads. Wisemans Ferry Road was closed because of that scouring. Repair works will eventually cost millions of dollars but that is but a drop in the ocean given the Gosford City Council already has a backlog in flood mitigation and road works exceeding $50m. The Government gave Council a $1.2m flood mitigation grant last year but obviously a great deal more is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give particular attention today to what happened at Tascott on the morning of 9 January this year by way of illustrating just how dangerous this flooding has become. On that morning a severe flood not only caused extensive property damage but also a washaway on the main northern railway line from Sydney to Newcastle. A disaster of the dimensions of the Granville rail disaster was narrowly averted that morning. My constituents advise me that some three minutes before the ballast between the tracks was washed across Brisbane Water Drive, a northbound electric passenger train crossed the area of the washaway. If that train had been a few minutes later and coincided with the arrival of a southbound goods train, then the chances are that they both would have tumbled into the Brisbane Waters with catastrophic results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem at Tascott has been critically dangerous for several years. It is the usual story of several government authorities buck-passing and refusing to get their act together. The flooding is caused by three totally inadequate culverts. The first under Glenrock Parade is the responsibility of the Gosford City Council. It has five cells at the moment and Webb McKeown Engineering Consultants reported to Council in 1989 that a larger culvert was required. They also told the Rail Authority that it had to install a new culvert under the railway line and the New South Wales Road Traffic Authority that a new culvert was required under Brisbane Water Drive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Tascott, horrified by the dangers involved and fed up with being flooded because of the procrastinations and buck-passing of three government bodies, called a protest meeting recently. I attended and agreed to take up their cause with the authorities in question and immediately wrote letters to the New South Wales Ministers for roads and railways as well as the Gosford City Council. Gosford City Council was no problem. It readily agreed to allocate funds and got on with the job of building the culvert at Glenrock Parade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 February I received a letter from Mr Wal Murray, Deputy Premier and Minister for Roads in New South Wales, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, the national recession has severely eroded the level of funding available for roadworks and there are no uncommitted funds at my disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked the RTA to maintain close liaison with Council to ensure that the RTA's share of the cost is given suitable priority among the many proposals for works on classified roads in the city of Gosford.</PARA>
<PARA>No joy from Wal Murray. On 28 February 1992, I got a letter from Mr Baird, the Minister for Transport in New South Wales, responsible for the railway line that washed away. He said that Tascott presently rates seventh in the current list of 13 culvert amplification priorities in that area. As I say, a huge loss of human life was very narrowly averted, and yet that priority is only seventh out of 13. The people of Tascott are certainly getting no joy from the State Government of New South Wales, although their lives are being ruined by this constant flooding and risk to lives of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these sorts of disasters are to be averted, then I think it is time for the New South Wales Government to take up the proposals in the One Nation policy that relate to our national rail system. A great deal of money was being given in that proposal which will allow railways like that in New South Wales to give priority to the sorts of works that involve questions of human safety and the loss of lives in disasters. I would hope that Mr Baird and Mr Murray can see fit, having been given all this money for both roads and railways, to change their priorities on behalf of the long-suffering people of Robertson, who have been flooded far too often and who deserve a far better go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must compliment the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) on his measured, rational and balanced approach to representing his constituents in the speech that he just gave to the House. I think it contrasted rather amazingly with the excited shoutings of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), the previous speaker on the Government side, who tended to devote the whole of his time to attacking the National Party. But I suppose that is fair enough in politics; and my intention when I came in today was to talk about the conduct of parliament to a certain extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I certainly believe in lively debate&mdash;there must be an exchange of views across the chamber&mdash;I happen to be one of those who think that if one is going to be a parliamentarian, and a member of the national Parliament above all, one has to learn to play the ball and not the man. Our prime offender in this way is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who does really rant and rave. He has given up the `scumbag' vocabulary, it seems, since he has taken on the new aura of dignity&mdash;dignity?&mdash;of Prime Minister, and he does not use that sort of abusive language quite as much. I notice, too, that in the five months that he spent in the wilderness on the back bench before he became Prime Minister he must have spent a great deal of that time standing in front of a mirror learning how to smile. I have known him for seven years. He has smiled more since the coup which put poor old Bob out than he did in the previous seven years. His minders are certainly looking after him to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is important that the people of Australia should realise that this is a place where there is exchange and interjection. I often find that people who come and visit Question Time, particularly the kids from visiting schools, say, `If we behaved like that at school, we would be in real trouble'. Question Time needs to be improved, because at the present time Question Time in this House of Representatives is not producing the sort of parliamentary behaviour or the activity that it should. What the people of Australia should realise is that there is a very good reason for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions should be answered. Unfortunately, we have a front bench of Government Ministers who specialise in not answering questions, unless they are asked by members of their own side. In that case the Minister's office has already written the question and passed it out to the backbencher so that the Minister has the answer already prepared in front of him. Anybody from the public who has been here at Question Time can see that any one of those Ministers, when they answer a question from their own side, has the answers already written out. Surprise! Surprise!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when they get a question from the Opposition benches they make no attempt to answer the question. Rather, they say what they want to say and completely ignore the question. The reason the Opposition is vociferous about this matter is that, if a Minister is making the most outrageous claims and saying the most outrageous untruths, then if we do not reject those claims that implies acceptance. If I were to say that 99 per cent of the members of the Labor Government have AIDS, they would jump up and down. Look at their horrified faces. Of course, it is wrong, and we should properly reject that. Equally, the Opposition in doing its job for Australia has an obligation not to let the untruths and, quite frankly, the false claims go by unchallenged. That is why Question Time is fairly noisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great attention to the honourable member for Page in his contribution. As I said just a moment or two ago, he seemed to spend all of his time attacking the National Party. It comes back to the question of truth. It is the question of truth that is of prime importance in this Parliament. On the one hand we have the Liberal and National parties' Fightback package and, on the other, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has produced his One Nation answer to it. Quite frankly, it is only a half-baked answer. In the last few days we have had the Government doing nothing else but attack the Opposition, not trying to sell the benefits of what it is trying to produce with its One Nation policies, but telling the most outrageous untruth about what the Fightback package will do. The Government has based this on an analysis which uses different ground rules. We cannot compare fish with beef and we cannot compare what Labor is saying about Fightback with the actual truth that it does contain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Page suggested that a vast majority of farmers and self-employed people and wage and salary earners would be far worse off under Fightback. This is not true. It is a false statement. The Government has doctored the books to produce a result which gives the answers that it wants. As Benjamin Disraeli said, `There are lies, damned lies and statistics'. What we have with this present Labor Government is a perversion of the use of statistics to produce answers for its own ends which have nothing to do with truth or reality. I am delighted to see the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) sitting at the table because only yesterday he gave this House the figure that youth unemployment was only 8.8 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He says it is correct. Yes, but 8.8 per cent of what? It is not as a percentage of those seeking jobs. The actual figure of youth unemployment in Australia is 34.8 per cent. That is the real figure for young people who want a job and cannot get a job. But if we clog up the books with all of those still at school, all of those at TAFE, all of those doing other courses, who are not in the labour market, and who are not looking for a job, then we can come down to 8.8 per cent. But bear in mind that the Bureau of Statistics says the correct unemployment rate for youth in Australia is 34.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not only a shame, it is an outrageous disgrace that the kids of this country have been put into this situation. They have been put into this situation deliberately by the Prime Minister, and the man who was Treasurer for all those years since 1983. It was his recession, his policies, that have done this. This is the recession that we had to have. We have one million people unemployed. A figure of 10.6 per cent of the work force is unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that will happen is that the honourable member for Petrie will fiddle the books again and tell us that the unemployment rate is only 2.5 per cent. That is what it would be if one used the same basis that was used for the other figures. The honourable member for Petrie is not being consistent, he is not doing it properly and he is not telling the truth of it. That is the problem with the Labor Party and this Government. They are distorting the truth every time they open their mouths. It is not for the good of Australia. It is for the good of one man; it is for the good of the Prime Minister&mdash;One Nation: one job. We have to look at all of Australia and not just at the sectional groups. There is no doubt that in the coalition's Fightback package there are just so many things of great benefit to everybody. The Labor Government says in the `One Broke Nation' statement that it has reduced sales tax on motor vehicles, on sedans, from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The choice of 15 per cent is not just by accident; that is what the GST will be. That does not apply to four-wheel drive vehicles and it does not apply to utilities. People in a business of any shape or form should understand that, under Fightback, if they need to buy a car to run that business, they will not pay a 15 per cent sales tax; they will pay no tax. The GST is rebatable for business inputs. This goes right along the line. Every Australian family will benefit from the abolition of the fuel excise. For my personal car, I will be paying 19c a litre less under Fightback and every business will pay 26c a litre less under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ensure that the debate in this Parliament is based on fact, not on lies and not on outrageous untruths.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a great possibility that one of the crucial issues at the next Federal election will be immigration and Australia's intake. We have already had attempts by the Opposition to give subliminal or code messages to the Australian electorate. This is obviously an attempt to utilise a degree of racism in the community, a concern with the change in our intake and increased stress on Asian migration. That code will say that we will insist upon a greater requirement of English with regard to who comes here. It will ignore, and it will not emphasise to the Australian public, the reality that countries such as Malaysia and Hong Kong are characterised by very high levels of English usage. Some longer term communities in this country, particularly from Europe, are already complaining that the current emphasis on English discriminates against those European countries in favour of Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we are seeing an attempt to give a very coded message to the Australian public that by requiring English we will change the intake. The facts of life are that in recent weeks the corporate sector in this country has said that it will not allow that if the Opposition is elected. Already some companies have said that they will take a stronger position with regard to supporting a heavy intake because of Australia's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is a very subliminal attempt. The Opposition is trying to tell the Australian people that we can go back to the old days when immigrants came from Cornwall and Ayrshire and there were also a few Germans and Dutch and that we are going to change this by bringing in a requirement for English. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) strutted around Sydney's Vietnamese community a few weeks ago telling it that it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, that it has done so much for Australia, that we love it and that the people are beautiful. This shows the contradictions in the concern of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to talk about some of the down to earth realities in my electorate, and to commend the work of the Auburn Asian Welfare Centre. In a leading work on the spread of the Indo-Chinese population in Sydney, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spatial Distribution and Concentration of Australia's Three Indo-Chinese Born Communities 1976-86</EMPHASIS>, James Coughlan clearly calculated and looked at the movement of those communities in Sydney. Of course, the reality is that there is a very heavy concentration still in Cabramatta, but a distribution of those communities throughout Sydney has also occurred. One of the greatest increases, of course, has occurred in the municipality of Auburn within my electorate, which, as of the 1986 census, accounted for 7.4 per cent of the total Vietnamese population in New South Wales. That particular community represents about 15 per cent of those born overseas&mdash;and I am not talking about their children&mdash;who in turn are 35 per cent of Auburn municipality's population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, with this growing population there is a need to provide services, and the Auburn Asian Welfare Centre is one group that is attempting to do that. The Centre's efforts have been characterised by great diligence; it is not a typical social workers' situation, with people sitting around drinking cups of coffee and empire building by stacking the local community committee with friends and other social workers. This is a group that has done a very thorough effort for the community. It was characterised by its document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indo-Chinese Residents in Auburn Municipality&mdash;Community Profile</EMPHASIS>, launched in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That survey, of course, followed a very important government inspired effort from the Administrative Review Council which looked at the Vietnamese community in Melbourne and the Turkish community in Sydney. It showed that, despite the urban myths about how everyone is on social security and everyone is unemployed, there is a great lack of knowledge in the Vietnamese community about their access to government organisations. For instance, in 1990 only 11 per cent of the Vietnamese community in Melbourne knew of the existence of the Ombudsman and only 13 per cent knew of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw in that study by the Administrative Review Council, over the period 1990-1991, by using Vietnamese newspapers and by using phone-ins, public meetings and the three half-hours the Vietnamese have on Melbourne radio, was an attempt to demonstrate to the community their rights of appeal and their access to these government bodies, and to see whether in that effort the knowledge would spread. Certainly by the end of that year knowledge of the Ombudsman increased from 11 per cent to 35 per cent and of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from 13 per cent to 23 per cent. That survey demonstrated a very great need. It came up with a lot of suggestions for both communities in regard to what government bodies should do to publicise their availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auburn Asian Welfare Centre relates to those problems. It has existed in the area since 1989, when it was sponsored by the western Sydney area assistance scheme&mdash;once again an initiative that everyone in New South Wales, except the Greiner State Government, thinks was quite reasonable. That Government, of course, has made very dramatic attempts to castrate the western Sydney area assistance scheme in the last few years&mdash;eventually being forced to back down, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, this group started from that funding in 1989 and it has produced the profile I earlier commented on. What it showed was a need for a variety of activities by the local council and government authorities. Included amongst those was a general community service agency. It was found that the fact that Cabramatta had such a high Vietnamese population meant that government agencies tended to depend upon people getting on a train and going up to Cabramatta; there were no local agencies that had these services. It said that the group itself should seek funding for bilingual staff; that local services should be responsive to avoid this travelling; and that there should be specific labour market programs, because one of the realities is a very high unemployment situation in the Vietnamese community, way over the Australian average. At the time of the comparative survey the Australian average was 8.8 per cent, against a Vietnamese rate of over 30 per cent.

His description of Councillor Pennell as a country bumpkin and a dill has naturally outraged local government people. This anger came to a head last Friday when the councils of the honourable member's own electorate censured him and condemned his repeated criticisms of local government leaders. The resolution of censure was carried without dissent at the Burnett Local Government Association conference and reflected growing dissatisfaction with his regular and insupportable allegations about even his own council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Apparently the honourable member is upset about the ongoing campaign by local government to have more of the Government's petrol excise rip-off allocated to roads. The facts are that the councils' pressure for more road funding has the overwhelming support of the community. To make such an unprovoked attack on a colleague in another tier of government who has no right of response not only reflects very poorly on the honourable member but also damages the reputation of the Parliament as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, when honourable members opposite talk about cowardice, I would like to talk about the Fightback package, which is a cowardly attack on the living standards of farmers, who are struggling at the present time, and working families. It is a king hit. It is a cowardly package. What it is meant to do is to shift money from the battlers to the yuppies at the top end of the market. Honourable members opposite have the audacity to come in here and stick up for special privilege. The National Party of Australia has been sold a lemon. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has been conned. Even their mate Sir Robert Sparkes, with whom I do not agree very often, said that National Party members will not be able to sell this package in the bush. They will not be able to, because they want to put a tax of 15 per cent on fruit and vegetables, meat, bread, milk and other dairy products. They have the hide to talk about compassion. They have the hide to talk about courage. It is not being very brave to tax working families and women and kids. That is what they want to do. Over the next 12 months we are going to ram this package right down their necks.</PARA></TALK.START>

Chief Superintendent Fox of the O district described people who did not wear seat belts as lazy. He said, `Not only that; they are just stupid. They are putting their own lives at risk'.

I have absolutely no intention of responding to this fifth attempt to ask again the same question that was asked yesterday on four separate occasions, and on each occasion I answered the question fully. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to make this additional point just to ram home a very unpleasant reality for the Opposition: this is essentially an argument&mdash;a fairly arcane argument, I might say&mdash;about how one should adjust the tax scales to account for the effects of inflation or the effects of wage movements. On the one hand, the Opposition essentially is now saying&mdash;this was made perfectly clear a couple of nights ago when the Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement saying that the adjustment should have been on the basis of a 3.5 per cent movement in earnings rather than a movement in the CPI&mdash;that if you want to maintain the position of a taxpayer at one point in time compared with another point in time, and if you are going to preserve the equality of that taxpayer's position, you should adjust the tax scales in the intervening period by the movements in earnings in that period, whereas the Treasury said, `No, that is not right. You should adjust the tax scales for movement in the CPI'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During yesterday's discussion, somebody asked me what practice has been followed in relation to this issue. I went back to a period when the taxation scales were indexed, and that was a period from July 1976. The Leader of the Opposition ought to remember this because he at the time was advising the then Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch. The then Fraser Government decided that it would index the tax scales from July 1976 in order to cope with this question of bracket creep, in other words, to index the tax scales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did it use as its measure? What was its legislative measure? Did it legislate to adjust the tax scales for movements in earnings, or did it adjust the tax scales for movements in the CPI? What does Budget Paper No. 4 in that Budget say? It says the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indexation provisions of the law embrace the income brackets of the rates scale, the general rebate, rebates for dependants&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and other things. Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are to be automatically adjusted each year for increases which have occurred in the consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA>So this was the mechanism decided upon by the Fraser Government, decided by Sir Phillip Lynch as Treasurer and advised as he was by the now Leader of the Opposition.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="834" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Calwell, I can say that it has been a major element of the Government's industrial relations strategy in recent years to move to a system of enterprise, or workplace, bargaining as the principal means of wage determination. That has been pursued through the award restructuring approach, section 115, relating to certified agreements in the Industrial Relations Act and, more recently, the enterprise bargaining principle and the national wage principles which require any wage increase to be based on actual implementation of efficiency measures designed to effect real gains in productivity. So we now have in the system a principle which is driving enterprise bargains based on increased productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to advise the House that this strategy is now bearing fruit. Although it is relatively early days since the implementation of that principle, there are over 40 enterprise agreements which have been ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission to this date. There are also a substantial number of agreements which have not come to the Commission&mdash;and they are probably not likely to&mdash;which will remain as over award agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the move to enterprise bargaining is on and it is likely to become very widespread in the next year or so. All of these agreements are designed to increase productivity and improve competitiveness. Perhaps none bears that out more so than the Toyota agreement, which covers 6,000 employees. Its objectives are linked to obtaining international best practice manufacturing standards, including things such as: achieving international quality levels; realising cost structures similar to those of other sister plants overseas; supplying product to the marketplace on a timely and cost-effective basis; and providing a rate of return on investment comparable to other Toyota operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that everyone in the House would agree that those are worthwhile objectives. There is an array of productivity improvements to achieve that. We have all of this happening under the umbrella of the accord, with agreement about the overall wage outcome and with agreement that the inflation rate coming from all of this should be such as to keep us at a rate comparable to that of our major trading partners. As we have announced in One Nation, it is our intention to move shortly to amend the Industrial Relations Act to further facilitate the making of enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to all of that&mdash;which clearly shows that there is an effective strategy in place to develop enterprise bargaining&mdash;we have from the Opposition a demand that there be a major industrial relations reform to bring on enterprise bargaining, as though nothing was happening; whereas in fact, as I have already shown, there is a major move in that direction and a very effective implementation of enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have from the Opposition in this area is a policy which is ill-defined, confused, confrontationist, inflationary and exploitative. The Leader of the Opposition said in Fightback that this was the most important part of the Fightback package. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centrepiece of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> is industrial relations reform. I know the focus has been on tax. Well, there is a 20-point plan in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, and the most important point is industrial relations and wage determination reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in the whole 656 pages of Fightback, guess how many pages were devoted to this central point&mdash;two. Of those two, one was devoted to expenditure cuts dismembering the Department of Industrial Relations and most of the programs. Only three-quarters of a page related to this most important area of policy. So I do not think the Opposition can really say that it regards this as so important if it gives so little time to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy is incredibly confused and misleading.

It is also very confrontationist, with talk about slashing the power of the unions, beefing up the Trade Practices Act and widening the scope for deregistration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. What the Treasury papers tabled the other day did reveal, to the acute embarrassment of the Opposition, is that the overwhelming majority of Australians do very badly indeed under the Opposition's proposals. It is fairly simple to understand why when we bear in mind that, as a result of the imposition of the new tax on food, clothing and a few other things, the revenue that is raised comes from each and every Australian&mdash;man, woman and child&mdash;to the tune, on average, of $23 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>

What members of the Opposition have been trying to tell us through all the $40 billion smokescreen is that somehow every Australian will be better off. The reason they get to that is that they are basically obsessed by models. But most Australians are not that obsessed by models.</PARA>

They know that there are real Australians out there who know just how much they are going to hurt. You recall, of course, that the Minister for Finance referred on an earlier occasion to this shopping basket&mdash;the food link survey which the Leader of the Opposition has waved around as evidence of the fact that most householders will not be badly affected by the imposition of this tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very great risk of subjecting Louise Sylvan of the Australian Consumers Association to the criticism that she has joined the conspiracy which is dedicated to destroying the Liberal Party and propping up the Government, it is worth quoting what she said the other night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, they laugh, of course. Because she had something critical to say, she is automatically to be disparaged, automatically to be denigrated and automatically to be dismissed. What did she say about the food link survey? She stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foodlink survey was not a good representation of the average family's fortnightly shopping. In that survey only $7 was spent on meat, for example, yet $22 was spent on cleaners, another $18 on personal hygiene products, like toothpaste and soap, about $14 on confectionary type products and another $13 on pet food.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Harpic and Pal story. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is out of a total budget of $142 for the fortnight. So this is quite an unnatural family. One would have to say, in fact, that they have a predilection for junk food and that they probably have too many pets and an absolute fetish for cleanliness.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that one has to look for unnatural people and unnatural families in order to find beneficiaries under this particular proposal or else one has to find sort of jacked up models, which the Treasury, of course, has been able to systematically demolish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, there are real effects on real Australians as a result of the proposals from the Opposition.

So it goes on until one comes to some preferred examples of the Leader of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tourism industry has experienced record growth during the 1980s. In fact, the number of arrivals in 1991, at about 2.4 million, was an all-time record. It is particularly noteworthy in that the first part of the year was clearly suffering a hangover from the Gulf war period. The latter part of the year showed very considerable growth rates, in a world context where the international tourism industry was flat.

What the Government did in its statement was to make a very substantial change to the cost of capital regime in this country. For things such as aluminium smelting with 20- and 30-year timeframe investments, 20 years will now be written off over 7 1/2 years and 40 years over 15 years. That means there is a dramatic acceleration in the cash flow, that is, the depreciable amounts, and therefore the cash flow of the business.

It establishes a rigour against which we can make economic analysis, but it cannot be the blueprint for reform, and yet your document proposes that you adopt industry policy based on Industry Commission recommendations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nine years ago today this Government came to office promising jobs, jobs, jobs. It now presides over an economy in which over one million Australians cannot find the jobs that they want and in which the unemployment of young people is becoming a matter of the gravest national concern. We are witnessing the demoralisation of a generation of young people; the creation of a new under-class in this country comprising young people who neither can find work nor, under this Government, are likely to have any prospect of finding work. On the most recent figures, 34.8 per cent of the young people of this country under 19 looking for full time work are unemployed. Over 40 per cent are either unemployed or underemployed. What that means is that 320,000 young Australians cannot find the work that they want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst unemployment, not surprisingly, has been in the Labor-governed states of Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. In regions such as south-west Victoria, Mackay-Fitzroy and North Adelaide, unemployment rates amongst young people are approaching 50 per cent or more. Even these sorts of rates massively understate the real disaster which Labor has visited on Australia's young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1991 some 91,500 full time youth jobs simply disappeared. Over 80,000 young people who would have filled these jobs have disappeared completely from the unemployment rolls. Many of these have simply gone back to school, where their unemployment is hidden from public view. Many of these, unfortunately, are unwillingly in the classroom, and this affects the standard of behaviour in classrooms and makes the tasks of the already grossly overburdened teachers even more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January this year there were 630,000 families with one or more members unemployed. Of these some 227,000 had unemployed offspring&mdash;young dependent members of the family. When family members are seeking work and cannot find it, families are placed under enormous stress. Indeed, family breakdown becomes more likely and young people are more inclined to leave home. The fruitless search for jobs eats away at the self-respect of this country's young people, and the collapse of self-respect in turn makes it increasingly difficult to take effective action. Over 90,000 young Australians under the age of 24 have been out of work for a year or more. Many have simply stopped looking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases the loss of self-respect becomes self-destructive. The rise in youth suicide is, regrettably, attributed by researchers in this area in significant part to the rise in youth unemployment, and I regret to say that the area of Australia most neglected by this Government&mdash;rural Australia&mdash;shows this problem in its starkest extent. Whereas the male suicide rate amongst young people in Sydney has remained relatively stable over the last 25 years, this rate has more than doubled in rural cities, and increased more than fivefold in rural shires and smaller towns. The rate of suicide has increased most in the past five years. Professor Brent Waters and Dr Michael Dudley of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Sydney's Prince of Wales Children's Hospital attribute this to a loss of identity and the economic crisis in rural Australia. They identify youth unemployment as very likely to be a major factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have emerging here are the ingredients for a permanent under-class of alienated young&mdash;Labor's truly forgotten people. A forensic psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 15 February this year as saying that we have prime social conditions for the emergence of American-style organised gangs, with the associated violent crime, drug and alcohol abuse, depression and despair in teenagers from a range of backgrounds.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a generation of alienated men and women with powerful resentments against a society that will not provide them with work or education or any short-term prospect of getting either.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent weeks the Government has been engaged in a cynical and callous exercise to lie about the figures for youth unemployment. We have seen the Minister's claim that the real figure for youth unemployment is 8.8 per cent. </PARA>

Is the Government going to include all retired people and all those engaging in home duties in its statistics for unemployment? Of course it is not. It knows that such an exercise would be ridiculed. The fact is that the youth participation rate in the work force at 59.8 per cent is not far below the participation rate for the total population. The effort of the Government to suggest that there is some special factor that justifies a completely different method of counting youth unemployment is total nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this unsavoury exercise in statistical manipulation reveals, however, is that this Government has given up on Australia's young people. It has run out of real policy solutions and it is now resorting to lying&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw that; it is now resorting to misrepresenting the situation with statistics&mdash;in an effort to sweep under the carpet what has been a major policy failure for which the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is there a human tragedy involved in the inability of the Government to address this issue, but also the taxpayers of this country&mdash;this will be of interest to the Minister&mdash;have invested some $48,000 in each and every student who completes 12 years of schooling, $40,000 in each student who completes year 10, and, on average, $74,600 in a student who does three years higher education after 12 years of schooling. The total investment of the community in the education of young school leavers who are now unemployed can conservatively be estimated at over $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That vast commitment by the community to these young people has been betrayed by the failure of this Government to ensure that international standards are promoted and achieved within the schools; that the very significant minority experiencing major problems in acquiring literacy and numeracy skills are properly identified and assisted; that there is a flexible labour market which can accommodate these students; that there is a tax system which provides business with incentives to invest and employ these young people; and, above all, that there is an education and training system that can provide these young people with the access, the skills and the knowledge that they need to obtain and hold jobs&mdash;jobs that are internationally competitive. Unless our young people have the knowledge and the skills which will enable them to hold jobs against the educated and skilled young people of other nations in the international marketplace, those jobs will not be real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality, unfortunately, is that over a million Australians&mdash;many of them school leavers&mdash;do not even have the basic functional skills in literacy and numeracy. They have been betrayed by a government which, throughout its entire term of office, has failed to promote the proper monitoring and testing of the key competencies which young people need to make themselves attractive to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has totally failed over these nine years in office to exhibit any interest in knowing the standards of skills and knowledge that our young people are acquiring. We now have over one million Australians who do not have the skills to make them employable. Why has the Government not acted? The reason for this betrayal goes to the heart of the very character of this Government. Its union mates would kick up a fuss if the Government attempted to introduce the proper monitoring of standards. They are more concerned&mdash;wrongly&mdash;about embarrassment to their members than they are with the future of Australia's young people.

So it is a simultaneous attack on both equity and excellence in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the commitments that are made by the Opposition cannot be taken seriously because a $4 billion hole in the figuring of the Fightback package has been clearly identified by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, which the Opposition has never been able to answer successfully.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a couple of comments on the unemployment statistics because they are important. A huge amount of distortion goes on here. We see Opposition spokespersons putting out statements saying that one in three young people are unemployed. Senator Baume, in particular, likes to do this. The reality is that, due to a revolution in participation in education and training over the last 10 years which has been absolutely profound, we have seen a doubling of school retention rates and a huge growth in higher education. There has been insufficient growth in the TAFE sector, admittedly, but that has been a State responsibility up to now. We are now trying to negotiate with the States to massively build that sector. But there has been a participation revolution so that now 66 per cent of young people in the 15 and 19 years age group are in some form of education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, in terms of unemployment, the 30 per cent which is quoted is the number of young people unemployed as a percentage of those actually in the labour force, but the majority of them are not in the labour force. Looking at the population group in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures 8.8 per cent of people in the 15 to 19 years age group are unemployed and seeking full time work. That compares with a figure of 12.4 per cent when those opposite were in government. There are now 40,000 fewer young people unemployed and seeking full time work than was the case when the lot opposite were in power. That puts that figure into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not say for a minute that the current youth unemployment situation is acceptable; nobody has suggested that. Urgent measures have to be taken to address that problem. As a Government, we are taking a comprehensive array of measures to address it. We are looking at introducing a whole new system of entry level training which will greatly broaden access to training. We are underpinning and supporting that with a huge injection of new funds for the TAFE system over the next three years. We will continue to build the higher education system with further growth, with an emphasis on getting the funding rate per student up and having a proper quality assurance structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to improve the mobility between the various sectors by encouraging institutions and TAFE systems to develop improved articulation and credit transfer arrangements between higher education and TAFE. We are looking at the labour market programs to try to ensure as far as possible that not only young people but people generally who participate in these short training programs, called labour market programs, for the unemployed get some recognised qualification. Such competency based training will be the first step into a longer period of education and training.

Other graduates from physical and applied science courses are facing even greater employment pressures. The figures mask even greater difficulties facing the graduate market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the blatant betrayal of that present group of youth unemployed? Those opposite have a voucher policy.

Then there is the Opposition trifecta: the doom&mdash;they are going to slash the job market programs and the advisory and maintenance support. Really, Mr Deputy Speaker, the comments made this afternoon by the honourable member for Goldstein and the honourable member for Gippsland are just unbelievable. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the release of the economic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), it is patently clear that it is still this Government that leads the debate on all the pertinent issues affecting education, employment and training of young Australians. As certain as night follows day, no thinking person in this nation could think otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contributions this afternoon by the honourable member for Goldstein and the honourable member for Gippsland have been nothing short of contemptible. When issues affecting this nation's youth are debated in this House, more often than not what we get from the front bench is nothing but derision and contempt, and the backbenchers over there know that is true. The body language from the Opposition front bench, particularly during the last two weeks, has suddenly taken a decided turn for the worst. We can actually see it over there: the come-hither look, the glad eye, the smirk that they have had for the last two months has disappeared. It has done a disappearing trick; it has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite did not like the One Nation package. They do not want to believe it. They are in trouble. They are in trouble again; and they all know it. The reasons are quite simple. The coalition espouses, as it has in this debate, nothing but contemptible propaganda. Like all propaganda, the Opposition espouses nothing more than a monologue. It does not want informed debate; it does not want a considered response from the Australian people; it simply wants an echo. Well, I think the Opposition is in for a shock. The majority of the Australian people not only will fail to respond to the coalition package at the next election&mdash;they will silence the echo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">George Bernard Shaw once said that we are made wise not by the recollections of the past, but by responsibilities for the future. With that quote in mind it is well worth an examination of the Opposition's track record of the past and its ability to take responsibility for the future. The Opposition must think everyone in this nation suffers from acute memory loss. This Opposition is so skilled and so expert at circumvention and pious fraud; this Opposition is so famous for chicanery and pettifoggery; this Opposition has no shame: it is expert at contrivance, gimmickry, diversions, red herrings and sophistry. </PARA>

That was the year the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development recommended to the government of the day some pretty simple straightforward recommendations. What were they? I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) knows what they were. They were simple; they were straightforward; and, as far as employment, education and training were basically concerned, they numbered but one, two, three.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo knows it. The coalition continued with a resource policy based on agriculture and mining, with no value adding and no concentration on the resources between the ears. Not only did the coalition betray Australian youth, it betrayed this nation. In 15 years it increased retention rates from a miserly 25 per cent to 36 per cent. In 15 years it ignored vocational training and the disadvantaged of this country in terms of offering them places in higher education. The coalition operated on non-policies; it applied its energies to neglect and indolence, and its all-consuming passion for maintaining the status quo. I kid you not, Mr Deputy Speaker, the coalition could stand still in a cyclone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the coalition wants to go back with the Fightback package to the Australian people and say, `Trust us, nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Give us another go'. However, the coalition has contemptuously forgotten the past and refuses to acknowledge the present, and it has no idea of what the future is. This is 1992, not 1968. When members opposite go back to their offices and look at their little calendar dates, they read 1968. The coalition is 25 years too late with this debate; it is in a time tunnel of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare what this Government has done for higher education to what was done in the past. Could any coalition government in the past think of an increase of 120,000 students</PARA>
<PARA>over five years&mdash;the equivalent of 12 new universities? What has been the coalition's record in the past on vocational training, the Cinderella sector of education? What has it been with primary and junior primary schools? It has largely been by State responsibilities. Who has led the debate on those issues in this Parliament? Not only has this Government not betrayed the past or present generations, it will not betray future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a salutary experience to contrast the Government's achievements in higher education with what the Opposition proposes. Commonwealth funding through Department of Employment, Education and Training has increased by $1.2 billion, or 41 per cent in real terms. A further $300m or 7.2 per cent in real terms is planned over the next two years. Capital funding is up by the massive amount of 444 per cent and research funding is up by 260 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the Opposition promises some ups too&mdash;inflation up, interest rates up and unemployment up, but not much from the neck up. With the Opposition voucher systems, equity of access for our youth would go out the window. Few students, as the Minister has pointed out, could afford fees which would average $12,000 a year. The Opposition would ration the current rate of access according to ability to pay. In reality that would be in important but relatively expensive areas such as engineering, science and agriculture, some of the areas the honourable member for Gippsland was so concerned about. This Government will create a new high status, better resourced vocational training sector. Instead of an extra $720m in vocational training in three years, Fightback offers a one-off increase of $75m&mdash;a blank cheque for the rest. When it comes to vocational training, Fightback actually implies a reduction of numbers in the level of opportunities for Australian youth. </PARA>

The Government accepted all these recommendations from the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is gratifying to note the alacrity with which the Minister has moved to implement the major recommendations of the Committee, although this no doubt says something about the nature of the problems identified by the Public Accounts Committee. The Minister announced the winding up of the business migration program by accepting the key recommendations of the Committee on 25 July 1991, only five weeks after the report was tabled on 21 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action was followed by an announcement from the Minister of the acceptance of the recommendations concerning the replacement category of entry for migrants with business skills on 17 December last. This new category of entry will, as recommended by the Committee, be based on a points system and recognise the business and entrepreneurial skills and background of the migrant. It will also seek to ensure that these skills are maximised for the benefit of Australia by establishing baseline criteria for all applicants, which include: an overall successful business career; a genuine and realistic commitment to engaging in business in Australia; registration with a business advisory agency in the State or Territory of intended residence; and signing a declaration acknowledging the Australian Government's requirements in relation to his or her entry into this country as a business migrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has also taken measures, in line with the Committee's recommendations, to toughen the standards for business migrants. These include the provision of ministerial discretion, via legislative amendment to the Migration Act, to cancel the status of business skills migrants if they have not made a genuine effort to meet the objectives of the category within the first three years of their arrival. At the same time, the Minister has initiated a mandatory comprehensive monitoring system for business migrants, with financial penalties for those who default. The business skills category of migration has been in operation since February this year, which means that the Minister has taken only seven months to implement the recommendations of the Committee from the time the report was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorry tale of the administration identified in the Committee's report of the business migration program is one that signals to the Parliament the importance of the scrutiny work undertaken by a great many of the committees of both Houses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The Bill represents another major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill involves significant restructuring: in this case, of rail institutions, technology, management and work practices. Without such initiatives we will be unable to meet the community's current needs, let alone our future needs. It is an important transport reform. Transport affects almost every area of Australian economic and social activity. As a significant intermediate cost, efficient transport is vital to the competitiveness of the Australian economy. Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains. This is highlighted by a number of major studies in recent years, which have exposed the deficiencies in our transport system and the potential gains from reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90, the Industry Commission estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional $6 billion in gross domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributable to rail. More recently, in its October 1991 report on rail transport, the Industry Commission confirmed the importance of reforming the rail industry. Australia cannot afford to ignore such gains, particularly given their potential for contributing to economic growth and our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard. </PARA>
<PARA>This is due in the main to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement, and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail. That said, the position is not irredeemable. Industry has said that it would make greater use of rail if a reliable, quality service were provided. Indeed, rail can confidently be said to have a bright future, provided it can be operated efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some types of traffic where rail beats the competition hands down. The most obvious example of this is the carriage of freight over medium to long distances. If rail undertakes the tasks to which it is best suited, and is efficient, it can carry goods at a lower cost to the community than road transport. And there will be savings in terms of accidents, air and noise pollution and energy costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Federal Government has positively promoted the revitalisation of the interstate rail freight system. This is part of a broader set of transport industry initiatives and objectives within which each of the transport modes can undertake the tasks to which it is best suited. It is not a matter of favouring one mode over another. What the Government is striving for is an integrated transport system that will provide the community with an efficient and competitive land transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That rail can be a success in Australia has been clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth's own railway, the Australian National Railways Commission. AN has long practised the commercial approach that will be taken by the National Rail Corporation, and its success is clear for all to see. The Industry Commission acknowledged this achievement in its recent rail report. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate AN, its employees and management for the effort they have put in since its creation in 1978. I expect that the skills and expertise built up by AN will prove to be a valuable asset for the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment of the NRC</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the need for change, the Commonwealth and all the mainland States except South Australia signed an agreement establishing the NRC at the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. For the first time, all interstate rail freight operations will be brought under one management structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC has been incorporated under the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arm's length from government. The directors of the company have to comply with all relevant provisions of the company law, including the obligation to act in the interests of all shareholders. The company has been established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The company will:</PARA>
<PARA>.operate on a strictly commercial basis, with a financially viable corporate plan, and be subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974;</PARA>
<PARA>.have access, by ownership or other appropriate arrangements, to the assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability;</PARA>
<PARA>.operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award, which reflects best practice in productivity standards through efficient work and manning practices, determined by the technical capacity of its  equipment and commercial considerations;</PARA>
<PARA>.have the capacity to contract out activities where that is the most efficient approach;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide access on a commercial basis to the NRC network and to terminal facilities for private and public sector operators;</PARA>
<PARA>.have the capacity to provide services to governments, with the charging for such services being on a strictly commercial basis;</PARA>
<PARA>.not be responsible, financially or in any other way, for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and transfer of functions and assets to it;</PARA>
<PARA>.be subject to all rates, taxes and charges;</PARA>
<PARA>.not have the shield of the Crown; and</PARA>
<PARA>.be treated as an ordinary incorporated company. </PARA>
<PARA>Any new rail projects undertaken by the NRC will be subject to the normal State and Federal environmental legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that the cash equity injections of $415m provided for by the agreement, together with commercial borrowings by the NRC, will lead to the speedy elimination of interstate rail deficits. The NRC is expected to break even within three years and become totally self-supporting after five. The meeting of this target will, in itself, be a major achievement. Interstate rail freight deficits are currently around $375m a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC was incorporated in September 1991 and directors were appointed to the board. The board is recruiting a management team who will negotiate an enterprise award with the unions and develop a corporate plan, including an investment strategy. These must be completed prior to the injection of capital funds by the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enterprise award to be negotiated by the NRC with rail unions will reflect the most efficient work and staffing practices, determined by the technical capacity of its equipment and commercial considerations. It is proposed that the NRC employ only those people that it needs for its operations: other employees will remain with the existing rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC is scheduled to commence actual rail operations in the next few months, beginning with marketing and terminal operations. Customers will then no longer have to deal with up to five separate rail authorities to transport freight across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the NRC heralds an historic development in the revitalisation of Australia's rail industry. The Corporation will provide a strong impetus to overall reform in the rail industry and the land transport sector in general. For the first time in the history of this country, the NRC will ensure that rail investment decisions are based on commercial considerations with the needs of a national network being paramount. Problems of the past, which led to three different track gauges, different signalling technologies and varying work practices, will not be  permitted to continue. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Rail Highway</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister announced on 26 February funding of $454m over the next two financial years for the establishment of a national rail highway: a standard gauge network linking all mainline State capitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program will complement the NRC's own investment program. It includes:</PARA>
<PARA>.a substantial upgrading of the Melbourne-Sydney rail link, including a separate freight line from Campbelltown to Enfield, which will reduce transit times from 13.5 to 12 hours by 1994, allowing rail to provide a reliable, quality service and compete for a greater share of this market;</PARA>
<PARA>.similar improvements between Sydney and Brisbane to improve rail's reliability and reduce transit times from 18 to 16 hours;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that the company does not have the protection of the Crown. That is, it is simply a company incorporated under the Companies Code, subject to all Commonwealth, State and local government legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that the Commonwealth may pay money in accordance with the shareholders' agreement, but does not of itself appropriate such moneys.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the establishment of the NRC will have an impact on the deficits of railway systems. Total losses on interstate rail freight, including AN, were estimated to have amounted to $377m in 1989-90.

<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to set in place the final stage of the legislative framework to meet obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, so that Australia can proceed with ratification of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill was introduced in 1990 it was then said that it represented the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of the Convention. Ratification of this Convention is in accordance with the Government's ongoing commitment to the international fight against illicit drug traffic and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention seeks to ensure that the international community cooperates in the adoption of a wide range of measures aimed at stemming the illicit drug trade. It was said in August 1990 that ratification of this Convention will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States and Territories have been aware of the proposed Convention and the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time the Government has continued with a process of consultation and negotiation with all of the States and Territories to identify areas of the Convention which can be given effect to by State and Territory legislation. The purpose of this consultation was to preserve the existing balance of responsibilities between the States and Commonwealth in the drugs area. The Government has been, as was said in the second reading speech in August 1990, very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field, and fully supports the continuation of the cooperative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory governments and their law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Government has sought State and Territory cooperation in enacting legislation to meet the mandatory obligations which the Convention imposes on parties. This includes legislation relating to money laundering where the money or property has been derived from a drug trafficking offence against State or Territory law. Unfortunately, there have been delays in some of the States and Territories, and some legislation is still to be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Outline of Proposed Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments give effect to particular obligations created by the convention. These are obligations with respect to criminalising money laundering, and confiscating the proceeds of drug offences. The legislation relies on the external affairs power and therefore follows the terminology of the Convention where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Bill provides a shorthand description of various forms of conduct which are called `dealing in drugs'. The conduct identified as `dealing in drugs' reflects the activities required to be prohibited under the convention. Most of those activities are already subject to criminal sanction under existing State and Territory laws. In this Bill the expression `dealing in drugs' does not create offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill defines an offence called `a State drug offence'. This is conduct which is both a drug trafficking offence in the terms of the convention and a serious offence under the law of a State or Territory punishable by at least 12 months imprisonment. Use of the phrases `dealing in drugs' and `serious State drug offences' is merely a way of simplifying the reference to these activities in the later provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Bill creates the required offences of laundering money or other property that is known to have been derived from a `serious State drug offence'. These offences are described in much the same terms as those used in the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill makes provision for regulations to prescribe States and Territories to which the legislation will not apply. This means that the operation of the offence provisions in the Bill will be limited to those States and Territories which have not legislated to create offences of money laundering. Once these States and Territories have enacted conforming legislation, the regulations will be amended so that the legislation does not apply to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that these Commonwealth offences will, in the event of a conviction, attract the confiscation provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 with respect to `tainted property'. This is intended to enable compliance with the confiscation requirements of the convention in relation to those States and Territories which do not yet have confiscation of proceeds legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In applying these new Commonwealth money laundering offences, it will not matter that the conduct which is the `dealing in drugs' offence, for example manufacturing drugs, occurred in one State or Territory, and the money laundering conduct, for example the transfer of property, occurred in another State or Territory. Also, it will be possible that confiscation of proceeds action might be taken against property in a third State or Territory. Even where the State or Territory law is adequate to meet the obligations imposed by the Convention if all of the relevant conduct had occurred there, it may not cover conduct that crosses State or Territory borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not affect the validity of any State or Territory legislation creating money laundering offences or any confiscation of proceeds provisions, and does not limit their operation. </PARA>

<PARA>The reference to the Law Reform Commission which led to its report was given by the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, on behalf of the Attorney-General in 1982. The reference resulted both from concern that the Act was in need of reform, and from suggestions from several State Attorneys-General that the Act should be extended to the process and decisions of tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>The State Attorneys were concerned that the process issued by tribunals, such as a consumer claims tribunal, effectively stopped at State borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Law Reform Commission found that, while the Act had remained largely unchanged, changes in Australian society since 1901 have been dramatic. Business outlook is increasingly national and, for many purposes, State and Territory boundaries have become artificial and even meaningless. Reflecting these findings, the Commission recommended a major updating of the procedures in the Act, and their extension to the process and decisions of tribunals. The Act is, of course, concerned with the effective operation of State and Territory process and so of State and Territory bodies&mdash;the courts, police and correctional authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, since the Law Reform Commission's report was tabled in December 1987, the Government has carried out an extensive and detailed program of consultation with the States and Territories about the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and about proposals to improve on those recommendations. The Government has been particularly concerned to focus on the practical application of its recommendations for State and Territory courts and agencies. We are grateful for the helpful comments and suggestions provided by State and Territory law departments, police forces, correctional authorities and tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to civil proceedings in courts, the Bill greatly simplifies procedures for the interstate service of process and enforcement of judgments. In particular&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>.The Bill sets out an exclusive method for interstate service of process. At present a plaintiff can use procedures under the Service and Execution of Process Act, or under State laws. This can cause problems especially where a plaintiff attempts to use part of the procedures under the Act and part of the State procedures in the one proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>.The Bill adopts the Corporations Act 1989 rules for service on companies, and the same rules for service interstate on natural persons as apply for service intrastate of similar process on natural persons. </PARA>

<PARA>.No endorsement will be needed on process commencing a proceeding against a person in another State. Solicitors will be able to use the one document for service anywhere in Australia, supplemented by an information notice as prescribed when service is interstate. </PARA>
<PARA>.Also abolished by the Bill is the need for a particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which proceedings are commenced. Instead, the Bill provides for a stay of proceedings in an inferior court where there is a more appropriate forum to determine the matters in dispute between the parties. Combined with the cross-vesting legislation which provides, amongst other things, for transfer of proceedings between supreme courts, this will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient venue. </PARA>
<PARA>.The Bill abolishes the requirement to obtain leave to serve a subpoena interstate. It also provides improved procedures for the making and determination of applications for relief from interstate subpoenas. </PARA>
<PARA>.Under the Bill judgments can be enforced interstate by a simple registration procedure in the appropriate interstate court. The judgment will be registered on lodgment of a sealed copy of the judgment, or of a fax of a sealed copy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where the Bill diverges significantly from the Law Reform Commission's recommendations is the interstate service of subpoenas on persons who are under some kind of restraint which affects their ability to comply with the subpoena. Examples include persons on bail subject to reporting requirements, on parole, home detention, periodic detention or various forms of alternative sentencing options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person subject to a restraint which might be breached if he or she complied with an interstate subpoena will be required where State law permits, in the first instance, to apply under State law for `consent' to comply with the subpoena, for example, where a witness is on bail, by applying to a court to vary his or her bail conditions. If no `consent' is given a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody. The Bill also provides for interstate service and execution of process of State and Territory tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that the Law Reform Commission's recommendation for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991. Under the Bill initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill can be served interstate. This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function, for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judgments of tribunals performing an adjudicative function will be enforceable interstate by registration in a court in the same manner as judgments of a court. It will be possible for subpoenas issued by tribunals to be served interstate where leave is obtained from a court, judge or magistrate. Differing requirements apply about who may give leave depending upon the function being exercised by the tribunal and its jurisdiction. The Bill will streamline procedures for the return of persons interstate to give evidence or to face criminal charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the State of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables copies of warrants, including fax copies, to be acted upon. This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate. The Bill substantially reproduces Part IVA of the Act which provides for the interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in 1963, has been subsequently amended, and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is an important law reform measure. It makes radical changes to existing procedures and moves into new areas relating to interstate process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 is a measure to reduce the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent and is part of the package of measures the Government brought forward in its so-called `One Nation, One Job' statement, which was revealed to the Australian public last week. It is interesting that this particular issue has not generated a great deal of interest amongst speakers on the Government side of the House. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has only had one speaker in this debate, other than the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), who introduced the Bill, and no-one else in the Labor Party seems in the slightest interested in discussing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is because the Labor Party, since the `One Nation, One Job' package announced last Wednesday night, has actually not been interested in talking about the package at all. Indeed, in the eight days that have elapsed since the introduction of that package, I do not think more than 10 or 15 minutes of the Parliament's time has been taken up by Labor members proclaiming, as they would see it, the great merits of their package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that since the introduction of this statement, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described as the most important economic statement made in the history of Australia, Labor members have spent practically no time talking about it, and instead have spent nearly all their time talking about the Opposition and the Opposition's policies, and producing all kinds of spurious and amazing claims about how, if the Opposition is elected to government, we will all be washed away by tidal waves and the sky will come crashing down and kill those few people who are left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to this Bill, it is, as I said, a Bill that reduces the tax on passenger motor vehicles. I notice that this has led to some comparisons between the sales tax treatment of motor vehicles under the Labor Party, compared with the tax treatment of motor vehicles under the coalition's goods and services tax proposal. One of the claims that the Labor Party members love to make is that under the coalition's goods and services tax, expensive cars such as Ferraris and Maseratis will be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor members love to use Ferraris as an example, not wishing to be reminded of the current Prime Minister's E-type Jaguar that he once owned and the fact that he was an enthusiastic member of the Antique Cars Society, or something, in New South Wales some years ago; a reference in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's Who</EMPHASIS> that he has had struck from its pages in recent editions. Interesting! The serious point I am making is that they love to claim that we would reduce the price of expensive cars, and they feel that they are onto a better argument now that they have actually reduced, or are proposing to reduce, the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in response to that argument that it is worth remembering that during 1991, and during the current Prime Minister's term as Treasurer, the Government reduced the luxury car tax&mdash;that is, the tax on cars which were valued above about $44,000&mdash;from 50 to 30 per cent, and in doing that, reduced the price of a new Ferrari series 348 by $30,000, which is the equivalent of average weekly earnings. It is interesting to reflect on the quality of the Government's argument that the coalition will bring down the price of Ferraris in its goods and services tax package, when it brought down the price of Ferraris last year by $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a slightly more mature level of debate is required from the Government, and if it wants to get into those sorts of slanging matches about those sorts of issues, I say to it, `Be careful, because there may be some quite scary skeletons sitting in your cupboard, and we are the first people, you can rest assured, to rush around and open those cupboard doors'. I have actually been doing that during the day and in the context of this Bill. As my speech progresses I shall, one by one, open a number of cupboard doors and pull out the skeletons left there by the current Prime Minister in the context of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this Bill let me make this point: it is clearly nothing short of a political stunt. It is actually not an attempt by the Government to improve the taxation system in relation to the motor vehicle industry. If it were, first of all it would ensure that where purchases of motor vehicles were made as business inputs, the tax paid would be fully refundable, so that we would not have the effect of sales tax cascading through into prices, thereby increasing prices, not only to consumers but also of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the sales tax on cars, in one way or another&mdash;be it a tax on cars of company sales representatives or on company cars used for other purposes&mdash;is all passed on in the form of higher prices in the goods sold by individual firms or, indeed, the services sold by those firms, and they flow through into export prices, where exports are relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were serious, that is the sort of change it would have made&mdash;but it is not. The Government has not done that. If the Government were serious it would do another thing: it would not only reduce the tax on passenger motor vehicles&mdash;voters' taxes, I suppose&mdash;it would reduce the tax on commercial vehicles as well. The interesting thing about this legislation&mdash;this demonstrates the complete irrationality of the legislation&mdash;is that the sales tax remains as it was on vehicles that are used by businesses, such as utilities, vans, four-wheel drive vehicles and so on, in an endeavour to earn income. In the worst recession in 60 years the Government retains that tax, which is ultimately passed on to consumers or in higher export prices, or both. However, the Government reduced the sales tax for voters by five percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the public will fall for that. I think it is so manifestly a stunt. It is too manifestly a stunt. I am sure the advice of Government departments was to do something that was rational. We might reflect on the fact that one of the prouder boasts of the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer was that he rationalised the wholesale sales tax system so that there were only three different rates of wholesale sales tax, or four if we count zero as a rate&mdash;10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. This was a boast of the present Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer not long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill introduces a fourth rate, so that we now have 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. It is not done in an attempt to introduce a measure which is economically rational and makes long term sense for the future of this country; it is just a bribe for voters, and I think voters are getting fairly sick of bribes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) really brings us to a broader debate about whether a wholesale sales tax regime is an effective regime to have. Would it not be better to have a goods and services tax as do 59 countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Germany and Japan and many South American countries; indeed, certainly every continent, and most countries of most continents? Having gone through a cupboard in which I found some skeletons, the material I found states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main advantages of a (consumption) tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is a criticism of it and, by the way, it has an extra rate in this Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, if one wants to fund one's reductions in personal income tax rather than blow out one's budget by $22 billion, as the `One Nation, One Job' statement does. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the fourth rate&mdash;the fifth rate if we include zero&mdash;applying to our wholesale sales tax. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a consumption tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a crucial design feature. It will assist both administration and compliance. . . </PARA>
<PARA>For businesses, this is a simple tax. They will also benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale sales tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks. I am really going to rub this in. The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the tax system contains three major indirect taxes,&mdash;customs duty, the excises, and the sales tax levied on manufactured goods at the wholesale level.</PARA>
<PARA>They are similar to the wholesale sales tax, which is the subject of this debate. That statement is not true&mdash;there is also the fuel excise and payroll tax. They are effectively indirect taxes; they are consumption taxes of a sort. The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This structural of indirect taxes is highly discriminatory&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is interesting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with services, particularly in a society which has seen services replace goods as the dominant field of economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the existing wholesale tax is fraught with anomalies and complexities, which render administration and compliance unduly burdensome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among its other feature which make it an undesirable tax are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the wholesale sales tax, which is the subject of this debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its multiple rates and exemptions, which distort both demand and supply decisions</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Valuation difficulties in determining a wholesale price in a world of widely varying distribution arrangements</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the tax must be carried by retailers when goods sit in stock, with retail margins applied to the tax-inclusive wholesale price</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A high proportion of the tax, about a half, is a tax on industry inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all of these reasons, we are inclined to scrap the entire sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . few people are aware that they are paying the tax when they buy their car, their washing machines, their bottles of lemonade or dishwashing liquid, it is politically a quite attractive tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is referring to the wholesale sales tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, could be excused for thinking that the demolition job on the existing wholesale sales tax was done by none other than the present Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson); the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith); or another member of the coalition. But no, all those words were the words of the present Prime Minister back in 1985 when he absolutely demolished the existing wholesale sales tax in very fluent speeches and in very fluent arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having done so, he suddenly discovered that it was politically inconvenient and, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>not long after, decided that the great hope for the Labor Party was to go out and campaign against the tax and pretend that if it was introduced everybody would be plunged into dire poverty&mdash;that ordinary Australians' living standards would fall way below the living standards of people in southern India, or somewhere such as that. Of course, people are not going to believe that. They will believe it even less when they are continually reminded what the honourable member for Blaxland, the Prime Minister, thought when he was the Treasurer and which, no doubt, he secretly believes to this very day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the arguments we get from the Labor Party now is that the goods and services tax&mdash;I have alluded to this in the context of the Ferraris and so on&mdash;will reduce the price of luxuries. Remember this? On 9 June 1985 the present Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the things in the 30 per cent schedule are today everyday items, such as TV sets, video tape recorders, biros, these sorts of things. And there are very few which are luxuries. . . I mean, I just don't think we ought to skew the whole tax system around to worry about a couple of items like that.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that people believed that if a goods and services tax were introduced and personal income taxes were reduced that would somehow be a slug on the poor. However, the honourable member for Blaxland, when he was Treasurer, not the Prime Minister as he is now&mdash;unbelievably&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the public understands that they now have to buy all these necessities &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the necessities of life&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and they have to buy after they are slugged every week, and if we relieve their tax with large net tax cuts they are better off.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment we all have to buy the necessities; if you're not buying them you can't live.</PARA>
<PARA>Brilliant! I continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And you buy them now out of your after-tax income, after it has suffered these very high, oppressive marginal rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are saying is you buy the same necessities, but out of your relieved tax income.</PARA>
<PARA>Why was that such a strong and convincing argument in 1985 but now our proposition is supposed to be the most terrible ever put forward by humanity&mdash;this cruel and wicked goods and services tax, which was such a favoured son of the current Prime Minister back in 1985?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These quotes are the most revealing quotes that I think have been read out in this chamber for some time. It is just unbelievable that people such as the Press Gallery simply do not have the capacity to rake over some of these quotes every time the Prime Minister stands up and attacks the Opposition for introducing a goods and services tax. Come on!  One does not expect 17 million people in this country to be completely stupid. But the Prime Minister is trying to treat them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that the Prime Minister used to use just go on and on. The argument about how a goods and services tax would be inflationary is an argument that he passionately argued against. I do not have time now to read out the quotes, but he passionately argued against it when he was Treasurer. He utterly rejected the arguments and, no doubt, regarded people who put that proposition forward as scumbags, scum and all the sorts of things he likes to call people. Now he is arguing that the goods and services tax is somehow massively inflationary and that it is going to have a terrible effect on this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent International Monetary Fund survey of 35 countries which had introduced goods and services taxes showed that in 29 cases there was no effect on the underlying inflation rate&mdash;only a shift increase in the price level at the time of introduction. In the six countries where there was a change in the underlying rate of inflation, to quote the IMF, `this was associated in each case with expansionary wage and credit policies'. In three of those six cases, the introduction of the goods and services tax was associated with an increase in the overall tax burden. In other words, it was not offset with personal income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party now claims&mdash;although it did not use to claim this&mdash;that a goods and services tax is somehow regressive. This is despite the fact that the Prime Minister used to argue that people buy the necessities of life out of their after-tax income and not before they have paid income tax; they are de facto taxed because they are bought out of after-tax income. In any case, the wholesale sales tax, the fuel excise and the payroll tax all impinge on the purchases of so-called necessities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How equitable is the present tax system?  The Labor Party, with its one million unemployed hanging round its neck, loves to argue that it cares about the poor and that what it does is equitable. The 1988-89 household expenditure survey showed that, in relative terms, the wholesale sales tax burden on grocery items bought by the lowest 20 per cent of income earners&mdash;the poorest one-fifth of Australians&mdash;is three times as high as for the top 20 per cent. Those low income earners pay 1.38 per cent of their income in wholesale sales tax, while the top 20 per cent of income earners pay only 0.44 per cent. What is so equitable about that?  Where is the equity in the current wholesale sales tax system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by opening the cupboard and pulling out one of the skeletons of the now Prime Minister for the last time. He said this on 7 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this.</PARA>
<PARA>Guess who is doing it now? The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be all to easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest denominator.</PARA>
<PARA>Ho-hum, Prime Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation.</PARA>
<PARA>Ho-hum! That must make the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, blush. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the question is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that not say it all?  He is right. This country does have the maturity to absorb a change which has taken place in every significant country in the world. When people are confronted with these constant quotes of the Prime Minister from 1985, the scare campaign that the Labor Party runs simply will not wash. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). This Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 gives effect to the Government's announcement in One Nation to reduce the rate of sales tax on a limited range of cars from 20 per cent down to 15 per cent. I take it that the Government, in selling its One Nation package, is relying almost totally on the filibuster that we have put up with and the tirade of abuse that we were subjected to during Question Time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and one or two others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating an important proposition and I wonder why there are not more members of the Government here in the chamber or prepared to debate us on this issue. Unless I read the speakers list incorrectly, there are no Government speakers involved in this debate at this time. Yet this is an important matter. As the honourable member for Mayo has said at some length, the whole question of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;not only this particular change to the law which is being proposed by the Government, but the whole range of issues related to wholesale sales tax&mdash;is absolutely fundamental to an understanding of what the Opposition proposes in its Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposition is very simple:  rather than fiddle around with wholesale sales tax, which the Government has been doing for years and attempts to do once again in this legislation, we will abolish all wholesale sales tax. That is our solution to the ramshackle range of wholesale sales taxes that we are subjected to at present. This particular legislation picks up on the proposition that the Prime Minister put to us in his One Nation statement in respect of family cars. As I think the Prime Minister pointed out, this will result in a price reduction of a little over 3 per cent, or about $800, on the average sedan. To the extent that that happens, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has already been said about the One Nation package and I am quite sure that the debate on it will go on from now until the next election. In legislation that was debated yesterday we were talking about how the Government proposes to hand out tax cuts to rich people at the expense of the poor. When we look at this particular measure&mdash;perhaps a little critically notwithstanding our intention to support this legislation&mdash;we must also wonder about the rationale for it. The Prime Minister said in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To stimulate the demand for passenger motor vehicles (other than luxury vehicles), the rate of wholesale sales tax applying to sub-luxury passenger motor vehicles will be reduced from the present general rate of 20 per cent to a new rate of 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I found this statement&mdash;as did, apparently, a number of constituents who were in the process of buying cars&mdash;rather misleading. In other words, it did not at that time define what sorts of motor vehicles the Prime Minister was actually talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, I had one constituent who was negotiating at the time to buy a Toyota Four-Runner SR5 Limited, which is a small four-wheel drive sedan. After hearing what the Prime Minister had to say, this constituent relied on that information in his negotiations to purchase that particular vehicle. Of course, he has subsequently found out&mdash;having done the deal&mdash;that that particular vehicle is not subject to the sales tax reduction. When we did look at what the Prime Minister actually proposed, we found that the sales tax reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent applied only to a fairly limited range of vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech the Minister said that this reduction in sales tax will help stimulate the demand for those particular vehicles. We are speaking in general terms about family sedans&mdash;Commodores, Falcons and so on. I would question whether that will happen. I have talked with some of the dealers in my electorate and asked them whether there has been a rush to buy those particular cars. The answer is no. I was quite disappointed to hear that, because that is the rationale for this legislation&mdash;at a cost to revenue, I think the Prime Minister acknowledges, of approximately $40m in 1991-92 and $185m in 1992-93. That is a fair bit of revenue forgone, particularly if the idea does not work. But I suppose that if it does not work, it will not cost any money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theoretically, the reduction in price ought to stimulate demand, but the plan makes a couple of assumptions which I do not believe are tenable. Firstly, it assumes that people have the money now to rush out to buy a new car. We all know, of course, that there are not many people at the moment who are able to do that. People have been so badly affected by this recession that I do not think this reduction of $800 in the price of a car, assuming it is passed on&mdash;and I will come to that in a moment&mdash;will assist people to rush out to buy a new car. Secondly, the proposition assumes that people are confident enough about the future to want to buy a new car. After talking with a number of my constituents, I believe that buying a car is the furthest thing from their minds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On simple economics, if one wants to talk about price elasticity&mdash;and we do not want to get too theoretical here&mdash;the reduction in price, to the extent that it occurs, will have a very limited effect on the demand for these particular cars. In that sense it merely becomes yet another cheap little electoral bribe. The whole range of issues outlined in One Nation have been illustrated by us, I believe with some effect, to be really just an attempt to buy votes. Of course, we have the prospect of the Wills by-election, the date of which was announced today. That will be the Government's first priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would challenge any honourable member to refute that dealers have been just about willing to give cars away in recent times. My local dealers have been trying just about everything to sell cars. They have cut their profit margins to the bone; they have offered to give just about every conceivable extra to convince people to buy a new car. There has never been a better time to buy a new car if one is interested in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales of new cars have declined so markedly in recent times because of the economic downturn, as the Prime Minister acknowledges in his speech. He said that the sales of passenger motor vehicles had suffered heavily in the economic downturn. They will continue to do so, of course. People needing or wanting to buy a new car would have done so by now because they could have done a really good deal. Of course, they will not do so now. I do not believe that $800 will have a great effect at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to question whether the $800 will be passed on to the public. The Prime Minister made the point in his speech that the Government expects this cut in tax to be passed on in full to car buyers. That is some expectation! Dealers' profit margins have been cut to the bare bone; they are hardly making any profit at all on the sale of new motor vehicles. I would not blame them for one minute if they quite reasonably took the opportunity to get a little bit of profit. As I have already pointed out, they will have difficulty selling motor vehicles in the future, just as they have had difficulty doing so in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that he expects the reduction will be passed on. It is a bit like his statement in respect of speeding up the construction of Brisbane Airport. He said he will urge the Federal Airports Corporation to speed that up. So far his urging has fallen on fairly deaf ears, I can assure him, so I am not sure what he means by `urge' or `expects'. In any case I do not know whether he was aware when he made his statement that retail prices on these cars are set to increase in the next few weeks, so those increases will virtually absorb the impact or effect of the $800 reduction in wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that, in this economic climate that the Government has created, sales tax could be lifted completely, it could be wiped from 20 per cent to zero, and it still would hardly stimulate demand. If the Prime Minister had gone that far and said, `I am wiping sales tax on new motor vehicles',  I doubt whether even that would have caused people to rush out to their Holden or Ford or Nissan dealer to buy a new car the next day. That is the economics of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we do not oppose the legislation, we point to it as yet another measure that has not been fully thought through. To me at least, the rationale for it is not entirely clear. The plain fact is that the people of Australia have completely lost confidence in this Government and in its ability to manage the economy. I can assure the Prime Minister that in these times a new car is the furthest thing from the minds of Australians. That is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have been hurt by this recession, and they have been hurt badly. We have said time and time again that it is our worst recession in 60 years. We have almost one million Australians unemployed, the highest number of unemployed people in the country since the Depression. We have record levels of bankruptcies. We could go on. The Government's response has been fiscal stimulation. We have said, and we will continue to say, how risky that policy is&mdash;although, of course, the chickens will not come home to roost in respect of the outcome of that until after the next election. As it is a risky policy, we question whether it is wise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, totally misread the signals in the economy at that time and strangled the economy. Of course, now the Government claims we have low inflation. It is a wonder we do not have deflation. Now the Prime Minister will embark on a fairly significant stimulus to the economy at a time when there are some signs of recovery on the doorstep. Of course, we run the risk of going back into another severe boom-bust cycle in 12 or 18 months time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other response of the Government has been through handouts, poorly targeted, with the prospect of creating 800 jobs. I can assure the Prime Minister there will be very few of those jobs in the motor vehicle industry as a result of this particular proposition. In fact, the motor vehicle industry has been scaling down employment for years. The irony is that when we look at this attempt to create jobs in the motor vehicle industry, and look at that industry alone, we find that it stands as an incredible indictment of every aspect of Labor Party policy. The motor vehicle industry, which this Bill is designed to assist, has been heavily protected for 40 years. Behind that wall of protection trade unions have introduced work practices which have led to appallingly low productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is, interestingly&mdash;and, as I say,  almost ironically when we are talking about legislation to reduce the price of cars&mdash;that cars in Australia are far too expensive. They have always been too expensive. The average motor vehicle in Australia is thousands of dollars more expensive than it ought to be. Is it not interesting that in the One Nation statement, where the Government talks about restructuring and so on, we find an attempt to bring down the price of motor vehicles? Yet we need only to look at that industry to find an indictment of Australian work practices and productivity levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that only the Opposition will act to make Australian industry competitive. Under our goods and services tax proposal, all cars&mdash;not just a limited range&mdash;will be made more affordable. The important point that the Prime Minister does not want to talk about&mdash;and neither did the Treasurer in Question Time today&mdash;is that cars purchased for business purposes will be tax free. At the moment, even when people buy a Falcon or Commodore at the reduced rates, they pay wholesale sales tax at the rate of 15 per cent. Under the goods and services tax, the GST that applies on the purchase of a motor vehicle used for business purposes will be completely rebated. If that term is too technical, let me say that it simply means that there will be no sales tax on motor vehicles purchased for business use. I think that is a significant advantage for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have an honest, intellectual debate in this chamber about the effect of the goods and services tax rather than, as I said earlier, the sort of tirade of abuse we cop here in Question Time from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I wonder when I listen to them whether anyone understands them. I am glad the Treasurer was never a schoolteacher, if that is the way he learned to put his case, because I do not think anyone understands him in here, let alone in the community. If we were to have an honest debate about the effect of the GST we would see in terms of motor vehicles alone significant advantages for business in that it will not have to pay any sales tax at all. Any goods and service tax that applies to the sale of new motor vehicles will be fully rebated, effectively meaning that there will be no taxes on the sale of new motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax, as we understand it, is beyond fixing. We have described it as a hidden tax, which it is. People do not know how much they are paying. On motor vehicles alone, counting the zero rate that applies, people are paying some five different rates of wholesale sales tax. Different rates of sales tax apply to a whole range of goods. People do not know how much they are paying. Here again is a real benefit of the goods and services tax system. People will know what they are paying. They will know what the Government is taking from them at the time they purchase a particular item. At the moment they do not. The average person one speaks to in the street has no idea what the sales tax is on a television set or on numerous items on the supermarket shelves. In my view, all we get from the Government is what amounts to misinformation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite talk about the few products which will be subject to GST on which there is no wholesale sales tax. At least we got almost an inkling of honesty today when, for the first time in my memory, they actually acknowledged that the price of these things was not going up 15 per cent. I thought that was progress. At least they were prepared to acknowledge that the price of some of the things they talk about will go up significantly less than 15 per cent, for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even today members of the Government failed to recognise that people will simply be compensated: they will have more money to spend. The move that we propose from direct to indirect taxation, with all its inherent benefits&mdash;and the present Prime Minister is one of its greatest advocates&mdash;means that people will have more money to spend, more disposable income, and will be more than fully compensated for the effect of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, as I say, does not oppose this legislation. We have some grave concerns about the economic impact of the One Nation statement.

The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992, which is before us this afternoon, makes provision for the measures announced in the Prime Minister's One Nation&mdash;albeit `Ruin Nation'&mdash;economic statement. I anticipated this type of legislation coming before the House on 12 November last year when addressing the Parliament on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. That Bill was about removing sales tax from oil for agricultural production and from vehicles used exclusively on the production premises. As I said when I was addressing that Bill, and as we have always said from this side of the House, this is not the way to go about addressing sales tax problems. Clearly, that amendment to the sales tax laws has done nothing to help our productive sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was claimed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) this afternoon that we on this side of the House have got the Fightback package wrong as far as agriculture is concerned. Let me tell the Minister that the amendment to the sales tax laws of November last has done nothing to help a farmer wanting to buy a vehicle for use in primary production. Most farmers, while they certainly want to use their vehicles on the property, also want to use them off the property, and they have been unable to make any use of that sales tax amendment of November last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a further apology to the Australian people for the ill-conceived, ramshackle wholesale sales tax system operating in Australia today. It has made a half-hearted attempt to reduce the burden on a small section of the community.

However, I know this not to be the case. I must say that the 15 per cent sales tax rate is a very curious figure.

Chances are they would love to, but chances are they cannot, will not and do not. Many rural families purchase four-wheel drive vehicles out of necessity owing to the appalling road conditions which are a direct legacy of this Government's neglect of the road systems in Australia. This is a reflection on the manner in which the Government has treated the motorist, as well as the fuel tax arrangements that have been used as a milch cow for propping up other parts of Australia. These families will receive no relief from the temporary Prime Minister's economic statement. The open letter from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) to the Prime Minister confirms that he is a temporary Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has been totally preoccupied with the golden triangle&mdash;Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra&mdash;and the better cities program, and has neglected the wealth generating rural areas of Australia. The 20 per cent sales tax rate will still apply to all motor vehicles except those specifically identified as passenger motor vehicles. Passenger motor vehicles have a very narrow definition and do not include those commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles I spoke of earlier. Clearly, we have an iniquitous regime where some vehicles have attracted the 20 per cent sales tax and will now become cheaper, while others remain the same price. In Australia, motor vehicles are now taxed at 15 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent, depending on the whim of the Government, whether it is logical or not. </PARA>

Coach lines and tourist buses are two of the few exceptions where sales tax exemptions are operative. If these vehicles, whether they be coach lines or tourist buses, are operating for reward, that is, charging passengers a fare, they are considered sales tax exempt. That is where they differ from the privately owned bus. They are, therefore, not burdened with the 15 or 20 per cent rate of sales tax. That is certainly a sensible scenario. A vehicle operating in such circumstances is running as a business; the bus is in fact a business input and should not be taxed. By exempting buses from the burden of sales tax the Government has accepted the principle that business inputs should remain free of such a tax impost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn my attention back to the man on the land and raise a further objection to the levelling of the 20 per cent sales tax on the humble Australian farm ute. This vehicle is made in Australia and its sale would promote Australian jobs. Sales tax exemption laws, as they apply to primary production and mining, allow for the purchase of a four-wheel-drive, one tonne, tray-top vehicle. The miner or farmer may purchase this vehicle free of sales tax if an undertaking can be given that it will be used 50 per cent of the time in the process of production. Ironically, this vehicle is not manufactured in Australia. The Australian made farm ute&mdash;the Falcon or Commodore&mdash;is, and its manufacture would create jobs; but it cannot be bought sales tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the farmer would be permitted any number of sales tax exempt four-wheel-drive, one tonne, tray-top vehicles, he would be denied sales tax exemption on the Australian made farm utility, unless giving an undertaking that it would be used exclusively in the process of production, that is, within or between contiguous properties but otherwise not off the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, so many of these vehicles are used on-farm and off-farm to run to town to pick up supplies. In 1991-92 alone approximately 40,000 four-wheel drive vehicles were imported into Australia. I believe this figure reflects the fact that one-tonne tray top four-wheel drive vehicles are tax exempt for farmers, but the Australian-made farm ute is not. This figure, as I said to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is quite alarming. If we are to get jobs, we have to consider and address the inconsistencies in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purchase of these vehicles could well be at the expense of the Australian-made utility. What does reducing the sales tax rate from 20 per cent to 15 per cent on a few selective cars do for Australia's employment rate? The Government has made a new family sedan $800 cheaper while vehicles such as the four-wheel drive remain at the same price. However, the one million unemployed or the four million Australians earning less than $20,700 do not have the spare $25,000 to $35,000 to purchase a new Holden Commodore or Ford Falcon, regardless of whether it is $800 cheaper or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures this Bill brings into effect will not assist Australians to become more able to buy a new car in the future. These measures do not make Australians more productive; they do not induce competition and they do not make business imports any cheaper. This Bill achieves very little other than to cause massive headaches for those answering inquires at the Australian Taxation Office; in fact, since the statement was made last week many members' offices have been inundated with calls from motor car dealers wanting to get the fine print. That has been very difficult to find; the Australian Taxation Office sales tax department was not quite sure itself&mdash;it had lists, supplementary lists and revised lists, such are the complexities of our sales tax law, to which this Bill has just added another dimension. </PARA>

Furthermore, the 15 per cent collected on all new motor vehicles under a coalition government would be completely refundable if the vehicle were bought for commercial or business purposes, no matter whether the vehicle was a tourist bus, a prime mover or the humble Australian farm ute.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of deja vu about this debate. We have heard it several times in this Parliament, usually when the conservative parties are in Opposition. However, I have to take strong exception to the remarks made by the honourable member for Mcpherson (Mr Bradford). He obviously has no knowledge whatsoever of the Australian car industry, nor the people who work in it. He has his standard line that if people work in Australia for wages, they are responsible for any problems that may exist in their particular industry. He takes no account of anything that happened during the periods when there were conservative governments in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might interest some people in this House, particularly those on the other side, to know that in recent reports published on the motor car industry in Australia&mdash;the Industry Commission report and reports by the Motor Industry Authority&mdash;it has been made clear that productivity in the Australian motor vehicle industry is comparable with that of Europe. It is not comparable with that of Japan or Korea, and that is understandable: nor is any other part of the world comparable with those markets and it must be said that the production runs in those places are certainly hardly comparable with that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson said that this Government had built walls of protection around the motor car industry. Anyone who knows anything about the motor car industry knows that is a totally false statement made for political purposes, with no basis in fact. The motor car industry's protection has been reduced under this Government from 140 per cent in 1980&mdash;the last time it was adjusted by the conservative governments under the 1980 plan; they are official figures&mdash;to 25 per cent at the end of the current plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant difference between 140 per cent and 25 per cent, and that has occurred during the period of this Government. It is not additional protection, but less protection. I will not kid the House or say to the House that I am entirely satisfied with that arrangement. I believe the competitive problems of the industry in Australia competing with certain Asian countries on price, production or volume are extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it ought to be mentioned, seeing that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) also made some suggestions about protection, that it was the McEwen plan that built the bad practices into the motor vehicle industry in Australia and which changed the structure of the motor car industry to a one six-cylinder sedan vehicle industry which very nearly destroyed the industry when the market moved to  four-cylinder cars because it totally lacked flexibility. I do not remember Sir John McEwen ever leading the Australian Labor Party. I do not think many people in this place would now be prepared to stand up for the McEwen plan for the motor vehicle industry. The McEwen plan applied for a considerable period of time and was only replaced by the Whitlam Government, only to have protection increased and altered after the advent of the Fraser Government. So do not let us talk about who provided the protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that bad work practices were in the industry, but one has to take into account that productivity in almost every section of the Australian community fell during all the years of the Fraser Government. It might even be interesting for some of those opposite to know that at the end of the Fraser period the government was spending a greater proportion of gross domestic product as a government than when it came to office. </PARA>

There is an attempt to suggest that 15 per cent wholesale is the same as 15 per cent retail; it is not. In fact 20 per cent wholesale is the equivalent of 15 per cent retail so that people who suggest there is going to be a reduction in those 20 per cent vehicles by a change to the 15 per cent wholesale tax are misleading. The tax on the two levels of vehicle, because of the different places at which they are applied, will turn out the same and there will be very little difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax reduction was brought in to try to halt a slide in an industry which is very important to my electorate. The class of vehicles is clearly set out in the Customs definitions. These definitions were not thought up a fortnight ago; they have been there for some time. If dealers do not know, it is because they did not find out&mdash;and I doubt that they do not know. This tax reduction is an attempt to encourage people to buy vehicles which are made in Australia, because all of the Australian made vehicles, with the possible exception of the two at the top of the Holden and Ford ranges, fall into the category of cars which are in the 20 per cent range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there have been falls in employment in the car industry. It is also true that over a long period of time restructuring has been taking place in the Australian car industry. It has been modernising and becoming more competitive. By definition, that means an increase in production per person, the mechanisation of plants and that the number of employees required to operate those plants is reduced. I<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>f some of those opposite, when they were in government, had concentrated on the equipment which was being provided to Australians in some industries by their managements, and on the amount of resources which was being invested in lurks and perks, such as the free executive motor cars&mdash;which are to be brought back under the Opposition plan&mdash;there may have been some investment in plant and equipment, thus increasing the productivity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half the effort of management in this country was directed to looking for ways to get tax free income and some form of benefit for which they did not have to do anything. What about the worker&mdash;the bloke down on the floor? If we put an old-fashioned crane on a wharf to unload a ship, it is unloaded slowly, no matter how hard the wharfies work. If we put a decent crane on a wharf to unload a ship, the productivity goes up. The Opposition, under its policies, is  always looking for someone to blame other than the people who should have been carrying out those reforms and introducing that form of productivity. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us in Question Time about the sorts of increases in productivity that have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take some umbrage at the suggestion that the tax on the vehicles that ordinary people buy should be made equivalent to the tax on luxury cars&mdash;all of which, incidentally, are imported. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said we should not talk about Ferraris because there is some unfair connection&mdash;and there probably is, but there is for most of the things said in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the goods and services tax actually do in respect of a $250,000 motor car? It gives a $15,000 reduction in tax. The same person who buys that car is getting a 17 per cent compensation package in income tax&mdash;much more than the 6 per cent compensation given to a person on a lower income. Where does the money come from to pay for that $15,000 reduction? It is equivalent to the goods and services tax on 100,000 $1 loaves of bread. That means that 100,000 $1 loaves of bread will be 15c dearer&mdash;not to produce revenue or redistribution, but to make one $250,000 car $15,000 cheaper. That is what the Opposition calls looking after the poor. The person who buys that car will save 17 per cent on his or her income&mdash;which, to buy the car, would have to be $200,000 a year. There is another $34,000&mdash;the tax on about 40,000 loaves of bread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A goods and services tax has only one virtue: it enables the Opposition to hide the redistribution of income to a small section of the community behind what is said to be an equitable tax. The crocodile tears which come from those opposite about people with incomes under $20,000, who have benefited from a number of changes which have been brought in by this Government, pale into insignificance when we look at how they achieve their compensation on $120 or $130 a week&mdash;they have to save about $30 a week to break even under the goods and services tax. How can they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear the honourable member for Mayo citing percentages of amounts spent on sales tax. One per cent of $1 is 1 cent, one per cent of $100 is $1 and one per cent of $100,000 is $1,000. There is a difference. It is still one per cent, but the person who pays the higher percentage, according to the honourable member for Mayo, does not spend nearly as much money because he or she does not have nearly as much money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two honourable members opposite have already said that the goods and services tax will have no effect on the sale of cars. It may or may not have any effect. If it stops the fall in the sale of cars and, therefore, maintains employment in that industry, I will be satisfied but disappointed. But I am prepared to say to this House that there will be an increase in car sales in the areas where the sales tax reduction has taken place. As the majority of cars in that area are substantially manufactured in Australia, people in my electorate&mdash;who work for the Ford Motor Co., in that case&mdash;will gain employment. If they gain employment, or maintain employment, it is a worthwhile move. There will be no benefit for them from reducing the price of luxury vehicles, as is proposed under the GST. As I have already said, under the GST there will be a $15,000 saving&mdash;$12,000 on a Jaguar. But compared with existing arrangements, the price of a Falcon will go up $700 under the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member for McPherson did the House a disservice when he stood up and attacked Australian workers who work in one of the most modern industries in this country, in which there is large scale investment taking place now. The Ford Motor Co. has recently invested $40m in Australia. It did not invest it because it thought its workers were not good. The company is in trouble in the United States, as I think everyone knows, but it has invested $40m in new plant and equipment and it has another investment package on the way. It has confidence in Australians to produce motor cars in a competitive form, even though it will not take as many people to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence exists, but we have knocking, whining, ill-informed people in this House who see their political future, not Australia's future, as paramount, who stand here and talk about who brought in the overprotection of the car industry. Do not let us have any mistake about that. The first was John McEwen and the second was Phillip Lynch. There was 140 per cent protection when we came to office&mdash;and the honourable member for McPherson stood up and said that this Government has created protection in the industry! I hope the industry can stand the reduction in protection that has taken place, because it has been massive over the last eight years. I support this Bill. I hope it achieves the purposes for which it was set out: to maintain and create jobs in the car industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, but I should like to make a comment or two about the remarks made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). As the member for a large rural electorate, I do not claim to have the understanding of the motor vehicle industry that he clearly displays, given the location of the electorate of Corio. I respect both his comments and the impassioned plea he made on behalf of the voters within his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, however, that he was at the very least ungracious in the remarks he levelled at the Opposition. He presumed that we have been guilty by association of being prepared to offer protection to the car industry, and he failed to point out that this Opposition&mdash;the Liberal and National parties&mdash;has been supportive of the Government for the past 10 years in the changes that have been made to tariff protection in Australia. He might have given a good deal more credence to his remarks had he been prepared to pause and recognise that it is a damn sight easier for the Opposition to oppose the Government than to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respect the knowledge that the honourable member for Corio has of the industry, but I think he allowed his emotions and his political prejudice to colour the remarks he has just delivered in this House. He went further than that. He stood up and said that the GST, proposed as an alternative to the sales tax being debated in this House, was being put forward to deliver everything;  that we, the Opposition, had painted some sort of utopia arising in Australia as a result of the GST. That, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, is arrant nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has been prepared to concede that this is not a solution to all of Australia's woes, and the honourable member for Corio and every other member opposite would do well to pause and ask themselves why on earth an Opposition, which could sit here on its hands and watch the Government fall into its lap, would propose a tax change. The honourable member for Corio says that the GST is blatantly dishonest and deceitful, and designed to hide various tax changes. Exactly the opposite is the case. Why would we, probably 12 months from a poll, propose so dramatic a change and document it in such detail if we were not prepared to debate it? They are the sorts of truths the honourable member for Corio might ponder before he allows his political prejudice to paint us as the villains in this piece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing tonight with the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No 1). I am speaking to an amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). It might be helpful at this stage of the debate to remind the House and those who are listening what the amendment says and precisely what we are debating. The honourable member for Curtin has moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "while not opposing the passage of the Bill, the House notes that the Bill adds a further complexity to an already complex wholesale sales tax system and calls on the Government to abolish this ramshackle system and replace it with an efficient and more equitable goods and services tax</PARA>
<PARA>Colleagues who have spoken before me have made the point that the object of all the reforms sought by the Opposition is to remove much of the complexity that currently exists in wholesale sales tax and offer the people of Australia a tax which is not hidden but is conspicuous and to which any changes would be so conspicuous that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fisher) have said they would be obliged to resign if rate changes were contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House suggests that sedan cars manufactured in Australia should have the existing wholesale sales tax reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Along with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I am a little cynical about the 15 per cent figure. It parallels all that is proposed in the GST and the Fightback program. It suggests that the Government is wanting to say to the electorate, `We would like to offer you the advantages of Fightback without the disadvantages that you think are part of the GST'. There is almost a smack of `all gain and no pain'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point, as I said earlier, the people of Australia should ask themselves:  why would an Opposition suggest anything as painful as a change to the sales tax system in Australia if it did not believe it was absolutely essential to do so? If the Opposition was not prepared to be answerable to the electorate, why would it document it in such detail in the Fightback package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tragedies of this Parliament this week is that the debate about tax changes has been so much about semantics. While the Government has wanted to trundle in all sorts of statistics, without necessarily giving them a base and making a direct comparison between its One Nation package and the Fightback package, the people of Australia have been left perplexed, not knowing whether one option or the other is attractive. I suggest to the people of Australia that they would do themselves a service if they paused, not to be confused by all the statistics that have deceitfully come into this Parliament, but to ask themselves why on earth an Opposition would be prepared to put in such detail and table it in the Parliament if it were not prepared to stand by those statistics and did not believe they were in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy Speaker, you know why. The shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), knows why, and I know why. It is because this nation is so far in debt that only a dramatic change in the way in which we can go about levelling tax will provide an opportunity to lift us out of debt&mdash;$163 billion in debt, so the newspaper told me yesterday, having gone up from about $38 billion when we lost office. This is what this Government is bequeathing to the people of Australia and we, the Opposition, as the alternative government, have proposed sales tax changes to enable us to go about repaying that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not easy;  it is not comfortable. There is no easy option. Somehow&mdash;this is not a matter of Opposition propaganda&mdash;we have to raise Australia's export performance by 3.5 per cent and sustain it. In 20 years, under both Liberal-National Party and ALP governments, that has never been done. That is why we say that our attitude to sales tax has to change. Australians have to get the message that, unless they are productive, they are doomed to a growing debt and doomed to bequeath that growing debt to their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose dramatic changes, dramatic changes that directly affect the legislation currently before the House. We propose to remove the wholesale sales tax altogether and replace it with a goods and services tax. Why? Because the application of a sales tax, on Australian motor vehicles and all sorts of goods, is unfair. Does the House know that, for example, we do not pay a wholesale sales tax on an in-ground pool, but we do pay it on an above-ground pool? What does that say to the people opposite who pretend to represent the people who are more likely to put in above-ground pools than in-ground pools? People do not pay wholesale sales tax on built-in wardrobes, but they do if they buy a wardrobe and bring it into the house. They do not pay wholesale sales tax on toothpaste, but they do on toothbrushes. They do not pay it on cotton buds, but they do on cotton wool. It is an absurd tax. In order to change the Australian attitude to tax, we propose to take away sales tax altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House suggests that there ought to be a change in the attitude we take to sales tax on sedan vehicles. We agree with the change, so we support it. But, as the amendment clearly points out, the change does nothing to address the confusion that currently surrounds the wholesale sales tax system. As the amendment says, for that reason we will commit ourselves to the people of Australia when we are in government, and the ALP, if it had any gumption, would stand as it did when its present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) advocated the very changes that we see are now necessary in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, this Bill supports the inequity that already exists in wholesale sales tax. Why?  Because it applies only to sedans and not to other vehicles. As the honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, a small businessman who drives a utility or a delivery van or a farmer who says, `The way in which I run my farm means that a ute is an essential part of my business' would not be able to get the reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent that is being offered in the One Nation package. There is another inequity in the way in which this sales tax applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses, plumbers, people who mow lawns&mdash;those very people we want to encourage to come off the unemployment queues and into business&mdash;will not get the advantage that the Government is prepared to offer Australian families with this one-off reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Why not? Perhaps the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, will offer us an explanation. But may I suggest that there are fewer voters who drive vans and utes than there are families who drive sedans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about farmers and the implications of this Bill for those whom I represent, I acknowledge that the Government has been prepared in its One Nation package to offer farmers $10.8m this year and $6m next year as a one-off payment to encourage them to plant crops. But, frankly, grateful though my constituents are for the gesture, what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is doing in the GATT negotiations is far more important to them. A determination by the Minister at the table and the Government that we ought to take a new attitude to industrial relations and accelerate waterfront reform would be far more valuable to them than this gesture as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mean to be mealy-mouthed in saying that; we are grateful for the $10.8m.

I could not believe that he would be so economically ill-informed as to not recognise that the payroll tax being paid by every big business in Australia&mdash;54 per cent of New South Wales employees are employed by businesses which pay payroll tax&mdash;is most surely passed on to the consumer, invariably the farmer&mdash;</PARA>

As if that were not carrot enough for the changes we propose, in addition all export goods moving off the Australian shore would be GST rebated as well, providing a deliberate incentive to Australians to be part of the export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From rural Australia's point of view, what happens when we remove the wholesale sales tax? We do not merely take a 20 per cent tax and reduce it to 15 per cent; we take every trucking operator and tell him that on his rig, on which he is currently paying 30 per cent wholesale sales tax, he will pay nothing at all. It will be replaced by a GST and the GST will be rebated to him because the rig is part of his business cost. The tyres, the fan belt and the spare parts that make up that trucking rig, and which currently bear a wholesale sales tax, will not bear it any more because the wholesale sales tax goes under the Fightback package and is replaced by a GST which is rebated to that trucking operator because it is an effective business cost. And as if that were not enough, in addition we remove the petroleum excise from fuel and replace it with a GST. But that is tax neutral because the fuel, wherever it is incurred as a business cost, has the GST on it rebated as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, for farmers there are direct benefits in the Fightback package, particularly through the tax system where we lift the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000 and for incomes up to $20,000 the tax rate is reduced from 20 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Compare that with the Government's One Nation package, which almost mysteriously discriminates against low income earners, in that people with incomes up to $20,700 a year receive no tax cuts whatsoever. They will continue to pay the 20 per cent tax rate. It is amazing that the Government would abandon four million workers and income recipients&mdash;farmers, students, retirees and low income earners making up almost half the work force, or half the Australian adult population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put to one side, once and for all, the nonsense that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) tried to perpetuate in Question Time today by arguing&mdash;fruitlessly to anybody who has studied the Fightback package&mdash;that farmers are not winners. They are direct and indirect beneficiaries of a low tax regime as set out in the Fightback package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of speakers have referred to the fact that not all vehicles are going to have their rate of wholesale sales tax cut. Without going into any detail, the basic rationale is that the ones on which the Government has reduced the rate of sales tax are those which are subject to the relatively higher rate of customs tariff, for instance, 35 per cent on imported vehicles. It was felt that, given that most of those other categories of motor vehicles&mdash;commercial vehicles&mdash;do enjoy a significantly lower rate of customs tariff, and given the relatively high proportion of those that are imported, the basic set of decisions that we have taken is appropriate. I also say that this issue, in a sense, reflects the general distinction between the Government and the Opposition. We are seeking a structure of the wholesale sales tax which, while it does have different rates, is inherently progressive; whereas the Opposition is going for a flat rate which the Government and I would argue is inherently regressive.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill which makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. Essentially, the Bill makes three key proposals. It also includes a number of minor technical amendments. Before I turn my attention to the detail of the Bill and the amendments which have been put in place, I would like to express my concern to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) in the strongest possible terms about the time given to both the coalition and the industry to study the Bill. The Bill was introduced into the House only last Wednesday, the day before the failed `One Job' statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We are debating this legislation just one week later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth putting on the record that the representatives of the industry who are most affected by this legislation, namely, the customs agents and importers, received their copy only last Friday&mdash;three working days ago. Given that most of the industry representatives operate their own businesses and participate in industry activities outside working hours, the Minister has given them little or no time to convene a meeting and to give the Bill the full scrutiny which it deserves. However, in spite of this the Minister probably expects support from these organisations for the initiatives which we are debating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that this legislation was scheduled to be introduced into the House of Representatives late last year. But because of a lack of time the Bill was held over until this parliamentary session. I am making this point for a simple reason: the Bill obviously has been ready in its final form for quite some time&mdash;since December of last year at least. I see no reason why the Minister could not have circulated a draft copy of the Bill to me, to members of the customs agents' industry and to the Law Reform Commission to give us all time to study this Bill thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am raising this matter because I understand that two other Customs Bills are to be introduced and debated this session. Perhaps the Minister will give his assurance in the course of his final remarks that in debating that legislation we will not have a repeat of this week's events. Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to the head of the Legal Services Branch of the Australian Customs Service, Mr Ken McInnes, for making himself available over the weekend to provide a briefing on the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to the provisions of the Bill. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill. However, I give notice that I will be moving a second reading amendment toward the conclusion of my remarks. Also, I foreshadow the coalition's intention to refer this Bill, for reasons that I will outline later, to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, as well as a number of minor technical amendments, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill makes three key proposals: it provides the legislative framework for the electronic lodgment of information relating to imported goods; it provides for the advance reporting of prescribed information for ships and aircraft at all domestic ports of call; and it amends the administration and accountability of claims for rebate under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that each of these amendments proposes significant change, I would like to address each of them individually. The first proposal amends the Customs Act 1901 to put into place the framework to facilitate the introduction of the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods. It also provides for the electronic lodgment of import entries and entry authorisation in respect of such goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system to be implemented, known as Compile, will be along the lines of the current structure for the electronic lodgment of export data; indeed, the Compile system has been developed to complement and operate in conjunction with the existing electronic export lodgment regime. This amendment will result in some benefits to both customs agents and importers. To start with, the administrative arrangements will be streamlined and the paperwork burden reduced. This will have a positive impact on agents and importers' cost structure, although I suspect it will be quite minimal. Obviously, the coalition welcomes this. Any reduction in the burden placed on business can only be a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that the benefits that will accrue to business from this measure pale into insignificance when compared with the comprehensive initiatives contained in the coalition's Fightback package. Just to illustrate, the coalition will remove the burden of wholesale sales tax from all inputs to business. In the case of customs agents' business, we will abolish the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on computers, phones, office furniture and all office stationery. The sales tax on a company motor vehicle will be removed, as will fuel excise&mdash;something which I will refer to later in the course of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will complement this measure by rebating all of the GST paid on business inputs as well as eliminating payroll tax, the training levy and customs duty. In contrast to the Government, the coalition will undertake comprehensive and meaningful reforms which will result in significant and sustainable benefits to business. Indeed, compared with the coalition's program, one could say that the initiatives proposed by this Bill merely tinker at the edges of a highly uncompetitive and expensive business cost structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the electronic lodgment of import information, as provided by this Bill, will allow importers faster access to their cargo. As the procedure currently stands, customs agents are required to manually convey to customs officers all of the appropriate material regarding the importation of cargo. Customs officers are generally located in a Customs house in each capital city and major regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assessment of the application and advice on authorisation to collect the goods take a minimum of four hours; although it is interesting to note that 10 years ago the same procedure took two weeks. The system which the Bill will put in place will cut the assessment time from four hours to around 10 minutes&mdash;a substantial saving in anyone's language. This is achievable because all of the information which previously had to be hand delivered will now be conveyed to Customs electronically. Likewise, the assessment of a cargo, including risk assessment and the notification of authorisation to collect the goods or, alternatively, of the need to provide additional information, will also be communicated back to the importer or agent electronically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, much of the Compile system has already been developed and is in place. Indeed, those elements which classify</PARA>
<PARA>goods into tariff categories and which assess the duty payable can already be used by customs agents. The passing of this legislation will allow customs agents to press the button, so to speak, so that they can convey and receive all the information via computer. Given that the Compile system is already in place and largely operational, it is prudent to make some remarks on its performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the users of the system that it is efficient and most effective; indeed, I understand that last year Compile received a Public Service award commending its efficiency and operation&mdash;although I suspect that the significance of this award is undermined somewhat given that Compile was compared only with other government computer systems rather than the entire private sector system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, a number of problems with both the profile element of Compile and with Tap-in&mdash;a computer system designed by Customs to complement the Compile system. Tap-in is the reference tool leading to the creation of an import entry and its subsequent transmission to Customs via Compile. Tap-in provides a database containing the Customs Act, tariff classifications, rates of duty, as well as other information. The operational capacity of Tap-in, from a Customs agent's perspective, is less than desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in spite of the system's potential benefits, many customs agents refuse to use it. There is a desperate need for this system to be re-figured and updated so that it is in line with current legislation, tariff classifications and valuations. Similarly, there is a need for some amendments to the profiles contained in the Compile system. I am advised that it is difficult for brokers to determine the differences between the requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Australian Quarantine Service and the community protection obligations of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Compile fails to differentiate between different types of sporting goods. The system will ask for quarantine details on all sporting goods which are entered into the system, when it is really only sporting goods using animal or natural fibres which need to be assessed for quarantine purposes. This increases the administration of import entries, adds to the assessment time of goods and represents some delay to importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should take the opportunity to update and upgrade the profiles contained in the Compile system in the lead-up to its becoming fully operational. It should also use this opportunity to upgrade and modify the Tap-in system so that it is more user friendly and responsive to the needs of customs agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other concerns about the Compile system lie not so much with the legislative framework as with the introduction and administration of the scheme. Specifically I am concerned about the content and the format of the new deed of agreement between the Australian Customs Service and individual agents, which authorises and outlines the conditions of use of Compile and, more particularly, electronic lodgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the electronic lodgment of Customs entries, as opposed to the transmission of these entries, was introduced the Australian Customs Service presented to customs agents the deed of agreement, which was, they stated, final. Indeed, it was presented to the agents as either take it or leave it, in a manner of speaking&mdash;hardly a fitting attitude for a government department which relies on extensive public contact in order to successfully carry out its brief. It is gratifying to note, therefore, that Customs did weaken and allow discussion on the agreement. However, it took some three months of ongoing negotiations before a final position agreeable to both parties was reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is not a satisfactory state of affairs. Consequently, I am seeking from the Minister an assurance that these circumstances will not be repeated in the course of developing the new Compile deed of agreement. Indeed, the Minister should take some action to ensure the draft agreement is circulated for discussion and the appropriate negotiation period is allowed&mdash;although, as I understand it, the Australian Customs Service undertook to supply the Customs Brokers Council of Australia with a list of the changes proposed to the existing deed of agreement for consideration. The Customs Service undertook to distribute this by the end of January. It is now nearly the middle of March, and we have not yet seen anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In scrutinising this Bill, albeit in the very short time given, I was pleased to note that the Customs Service has put in place appropriate measures to guarantee the security of information supplied by importers. The security measures introduced by this Bill include the allocation to each importer of a unique identity code known as the PIN number. The computer system will cross-reference this PIN number with other information contained in its database to verify the legality of the user and will hence allow access to the network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, some confusion about legality regarding the use of the PIN number, namely, whether it falls on the individual user or on the corporate identity. This is something which needs to be studied more thoroughly. I am sure this will occur as the Bill moves through the Senate and through the committee process. Secondly, there is some concern about issuing the new passwords over the phone. While this is only done when an old PIN number has been lost, it still represents a high risk operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my remarks on this portion of the Bill, I would like to point out that the use of the electronic lodgment system is optional. The current manual lodgment system will remain in place. As such, there is no need for importers, unless they so desire, to spend vast sums of money to purchase new computer hardware. As I have already mentioned, the Compile software is compatible with the existing export lodgment system software, thus removing the need for business to upgrade or purchase new equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal in the Bill provides for appropriate information to be transmitted by an aircraft or ship prior to its arrival in a domestic port. Under the previous legislation ship masters and aircraft captains were required to present to Customs officers upon or within 24 hours of arrival the details of cargo being carried. A 1990 amendment to the Customs Act provided for this information to be lodged electronically prior to the arrival of the vessel at the first Australian port of call. The prescribed information is still to be presented by hand upon arrival at all subsequent ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advanced reporting regime has given Customs the opportunity to better scrutinise cargo and assess and target risks. Indeed, it is in line with the Customs community obligation protection requirements. The regime has given importers faster access to cargo carried on board vessels when that cargo is unloaded at the first port of call. Again, this can only be of benefit to business. I should point out that there are some anomalies in that this facility is only available to importers when the goods are unloaded at the first port of call. There is still some time delay when cargo is unloaded at subsequent domestic ports of call. It is pleasing to note, therefore, that the Bill removes this anomaly by extending the advance reporting regime to all domestic ports of call or ships or aircraft. Consequently, all importers nationwide will have the same speedy access to their cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the information to be provided has been extended to include the number and names of crew members on board, as well as the number of passengers carried. This will provide for the advanced checking of crew numbers and crew members and allow for the appropriate number of processing officers to be available for the passengers when the ship or aircraft arrives. The initiative should result in a more streamlined method of processing passengers and crew, something which overseas travellers will welcome and which could possibly be described as well overdue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will support this amendment. Anything which facilitates better community protection and at the same time modifies a cumbersome administrative procedure and assisting business deserves support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the third element of the Bill, namely, the changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. That scheme provides for rebates of excise or customs duty on diesel fuel purchased for specific off-road uses in mining operations; primary production, including agriculture, fishing and forestry operations; and in residential premises; hospitals; nursing homes and homes for the aged. Excise and customs rates of duty on diesel fuel are adjusted in February and August each year in line with the movements in the CPI. Rebates differ between different categories of claimant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last financial year over $836m was paid in respect of 229,131 diesel fuel rebate claims. This is an increase over the previous year of just over 11 per cent in the amount paid and of just over 5 per cent in the number of claims submitted. In 1989-90, 217,086 claims were submitted with over $752m being paid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of quite significant problems with the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. This was confirmed by the Australian National Audit Office in its 1991 audit of the scheme. It found, and I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of weaknesses in the current procedures which are adversely affecting the processing of claims. Some of those weaknesses stem from the design of procedures and some from their implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office went on to identify the following key problems with the diesel fuel rebate scheme: the complexity of the eligibility criteria caused difficulties in determining which operations were eligible for rebate and to what extent; the payment of the rebate was based on a forecast of eligible use prepared by the claimant, as against actual use; weaknesses in the rebate control procedures included the fact that a variety of documentation was being accepted as proof of purchase of fuel; the extent of overpayments under the scheme was not known; and investigation functions were compromised to achieve processing targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reassuring that this legislation is designed to address in part some of the administrative problems of the scheme. The resulting streamlined administration scheme will be welcomed by users. The coalition also believes that this is a step in the right direction, albeit a very small one. But this is something which I will address in more detail later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before doing this, I take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House what I regard as a very serious problem with the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, a problem which, I might add, has had severe repercussions on business. Late last year it was brought to the attention of my office that the Tasmanian regional office of the Australian Customs Service had adopted an unofficial `go slow'. This was, I understand, in protest at the reduction in staff numbers in the Tasmanian regional office. Staff numbers were reduced from 101 in 1988-89 to 85 in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not have thought that this was unusual, given the efficiency gains which were supposed to be achieved from award restructuring and other productivity measures. Customs officers obviously thought otherwise and indicated they were, in fact, overworked. One of the casualties of this `go slow' was the processing of claims for the diesel fuel rebate. Instead of the two to three weeks normally taken to process claims, the time ballooned to eight to 10 weeks. Some claimants waited well over three months to receive their rebate. We are not talking about insignificant amounts of money here. The average claim is for around $22,000, although a number of the claims were for amounts between $57,000 and $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out to the House that the claims were of this size because many loggers, who are large users of diesel fuel, submit their claims every two or three months. This is for a number of reasons but primarily to reduce their own administrative burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, many loggers use their diesel fuel rebates as a financial safety net or as a means of meeting larger bills when they become due. Consequently, this unofficial `go slow' and the subsequent withholding of payments has had a devastating effect on the businesses of the claimants, something which will only compound the impact on businesses of the worst recession for 60 years. Indeed, one logger that I know of has been forced to put two of his trucks up for sale in order to pay his debts, which otherwise could have been met by this rebate. This is a deplorable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The livelihoods of many of Tasmania's struggling small businesses are being put at risk because of the wilful action of a few Customs officers. It is distressing, to say the least, that a number of government bureaucrats can hold the private sector to ransom in this way. Moreover, it is a direct consequence of this Government's poor policies that businesses have to pay excise on their fuel and hence have to be put through this cumbersome procedure in the first place. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House regrets the Government's failure to take advantage of the opportunity provided by this Bill to introduce more extensive changes to customs and excise legislation, including:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Petroleum excise is a heavy consumption tax levied on a particularly narrow base. The petroleum products excise currently collects around 25c from every litre of fuel. This tax is so onerous on individuals and business that the revenue collected by government has increased from $1.3 billion in 1982-83 to $6.6 billion today. The Industry Commission stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that a significant proportion of existing excises fall on intermediate or business use. It is a general principle of taxation that taxation of intermediate goods has costs which can be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission concluded further that rates of petroleum excise were too high; that a strong case could be made for exempting the intermediate use of petroleum products from excise; and that a broadening of the community tax base by introducing a value added tax would have a number of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the coalition would scrap the fuel excise. That is what the Government should do if it is serious about fixing the problems in the economy today. It would abolish the fuel excise levy rather than proposing any more amendments. The benefits from the coalition's action plan would be substantial, particularly for all business. It would mean our businesses would become more productive and more competitive and able to gain a true world competitive standard. For business it would mean that fuel prices would drop by 26c per litre, as all input costs to business would be rebatable. The present wholesale sales tax system is a cost on our exports of $1.7 billion. If we are truly to get our industries and our domestic market world competitive, we need these sorts of amendments and changes to the system. This Bill does not pick up that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the coalition's position on this Bill. We support the broad thrust of the amendments being proposed by this legislation. We are, however, concerned about the haste with which it has been introduced and rushed through the House. The natural consequence of this is that both we and members of the industry who are most affected by the amendments have had little time to study them. Indeed, we have not been in a position to give the Bill the full and frank scrutiny it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are concerned about the lack of consultation undertaken by the Customs Service, particularly with regard to what will be a revolutionary new scheme. Therefore, to allow community discussion and to facilitate more thorough scrutiny of the provisions of the Bill, when the Bill reaches the Senate chamber we will be seeking to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. There are three main proposals in this Bill. The Opposition has moved a second reading amendment which the Government will oppose, and which I will certainly oppose. The Bill proposes firstly to amend the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods, and the electronic lodgment of import entries in respect of such goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes secondly to amend provisions of the Customs Act relating to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo, passengers and crew, to enhance the operation of that scheme. The third amendment proposed to the Customs Act is to improve the accountability and administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme in response to the Audit Report No. 27 of 1990-91 by the Australian National Audit Office, tabled in the Parliament on 16 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments for the electronic communication and lodgment of import information are a continuation of the improvements and updating of entry facilities which were initiated by the EXIT amendments for export information introduced into the Customs Act by Act No. 111 of 1990. With regard to cargo reporting, the proposed amendments will enhance the ability of Customs to fully risk-assess incoming cargo, crew and passengers for the detection of narcotics and other prohibited imports by ensuring that all advanced reports are communicated to Customs at each port or airport of call in Australia rather than only at the first port or airport of arrival. This is important because drugs certainly are a massive problem for the Western world. It is necessary for us to streamline our efforts through every avenue open to us to prohibit the entry of prohibited drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and is designed to streamline the present claims procedures and improve the accountability and administration of the scheme. There are also other minor proposed amendments to the Customs Act and the Excise Act. From 1990 to 1994, in dollar values, the cost of implementing the new scheme will amount to a total of $1.883m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compliment the Australian Customs Service. It does an admirable job. It is always very easy to find fault with or to criticise various departments, but Customs has always done an outstanding job, particularly these days with sophistication, massive air travel and shipping, particularly in the north of this country. There should be recognition of the dedication of the men and women involved in our Customs Service. In relation to diesel fuel rebate, there is a benefit to agriculture of approximately half a billion dollars per annum, something that deserves recognition. Of course, this leads to a reduction in input costs, which also deserves recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also compliment the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) for the way in which he is handling his portfolio. There is often rhetoric and emotion involved in accusations of dumping in this country and accusations of action that should be stopped immediately. There are proper procedures through the Customs Service and through the Anti-Dumping Authority. When one goes through these procedures one finds that the case is often much different from what one has originally read in the paper. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS> recently, the editor, John Cameron, pointed to what we should do if we want to achieve the labelling of food products&mdash;which has a big bearing on imported foods. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If so, tell your retailer or an Australian food producer. But do not tell the governments because they will do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA>I had already informed the editor that the Government had an inquiry under way and we needed the cooperation of the six State governments to achieve labelling of foods products. As of 28 February the new National Food Authority foods standard took effect, which means that now all the imported, unpackaged fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts on sale to the general public must have their country of origin or a sign with `Imported' clearly displayed nearby. I do not know whether the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS> will recognise that and put it in the paper, but it is important because primary producers and the general public will know the facts only if they are properly informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rhetoric and the nonsense that comes from particularly National Party politicians and supporters in Queensland often disappoints me. They use rhetoric and say that any produce coming into this country is dumped or is heavily subsidised and that we should ban it, without regard for bilateral trade or for the effect that would have if we placed protective barriers on those products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for primary industries in Queensland, Trevor Perrett from the electorate of Barambah, recently came out in a scattergun approach and said that heavily subsidised and dumped products are flooding into Australia and destroying Australian markets. The point is that $6.3 billion worth of processed and semiprocessed Australian food product is exported annually&mdash;right now! If we took the advice of this character, the shadow Minister for primary industries, we would see retaliatory action which would devastate the beef industry, the sugar industry, the wheat industry, the wool industry&mdash;the large industries. We have to find markets for some 80 per cent of these industries because we have such a small domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time there is a bit of pressure put on these politicians, instead of telling the truth and saying that we have a proper procedure through Customs and through the Anti-Dumping Authority, they simply say that the product is being dumped and the Government should do something about it. It is just unfortunate that they do not have the courage to tell their own supporters the truth. It is a great pity that the National Party does not pay some of these clowns to go over to Europe and find out what the real trade scene is about instead of attacking the Customs Service, the ADA or the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> an article headed `Pick `n Pay critical of Golden Circle'. I am not criticising Golden Circle, because it does an outstanding job; I have visited its processing plant. But the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pick `n Pay grocery chief, Peter Dove, has criticised Golden Circle for not being able to supply canned sliced pineapple during the peak summer months from November to February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dove said Golden Circle complained about import competition but never had enough stock to supply the market throughout an entire season.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because seasons are often cyclical and there are down times in the market. Some processors actually have to import to keep production up. For a period we have often had rhetoric about banning products and then found a shortfall at the same time. It would be handy if in Queensland the National Party told the full story. That would mean that it would be unpopular, perhaps, but it would be better if its supporters and all farmers were better informed of the facts instead of the nonsense that certainly does the rounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move on to the amendment moved by the Opposition to the second reading of this Bill referring to the abolition of the excise duty on fuel, including diesel fuel. The Opposition has been asked several times how it is going to fund roads and it has not responded. The Opposition has said that it is going to use road user charging. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has a large electorate like mine and I would like to ask him what level of road user charging he is going to put on semitrailers, four-wheel drives and ordinary vehicles. If the Opposition were to take fuel excise away, unless it would allow roads to run down it would have to put thousands of dollars of registration fees on people, up front&mdash;a one-off hit, a one-off whack. It would not be user pays as under the present system, but a one-off whack. As I have said in this House before, I would like to see the local government authority in Queensland put those opposite under scrutiny, because so far it has been very quiet on an issue that directly affects its livelihood, that is, roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition should come clean and say exactly what level of road user charging it is going to use if it abolishes excise, because at this stage it has not said what it is going to do. As to the rhetoric about the money from excise not all going into roads, which has been doing the rounds for ages, I point out that all bar about 5c per litre goes into road use and road trauma; only about 5c does not. That amount goes into education, defence and all the other services that are provided in this country. Again, when the Opposition is put to the test as to what areas it will fund if excise is taken away, it simply does not answer. That is why I would like to see this issue of road user charges answered by the Opposition, because we have to fund roads and, if the Opposition wants to abolish excise, it would have to find the money from somewhere. That has not been said. That is a challenge that needs to be met. </PARA>

Neither Jim Pennell, Alec MacIntosh, Chairman of Kilkivan Shire, nor Bill Roberts, Chairman of Murgon Shire, ever raised one whimper of criticism because their mates were in the State National Party Government in Queensland. They were prepared to sit back and cop that. Every time we come to a Federal election these same clowns come out and attack the Federal Government. But I could not expect much more from Bill Roberts.

Of course over in Britain there is a difference: food, newspapers, travel and children's clothing are zero rated. It is a bit different here: food would be taxed at 15 per cent. I do not think that is fair, particularly given the fact that people on low incomes would be those worst hit&mdash;the disabled, the aged, farmers, many of whom will not have an income or at least only a very small income this year&mdash;and many households will be much worse off. In fact 60 per cent of farm and self-employed households will be worse off under the goods and services tax of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that these two amendments, which would change the revenue base and inflict the weight back onto those people, should be supported. I totally oppose these amendments. In doing so, I will say what I said earlier today in this House and what I will keep saying: under a goods and services tax primary producers would have to pay a 15 per cent tax at the retail level on their products&mdash;the dairy industry would have to pay 15 per cent on its products; the cereal producers would have to pay a 15 per cent tax for the domestic market; the fresh fruit and vegetables industries, the poultry industry and the pig industry would all have to pay that 15 per cent tax on their products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that the shadow Minister for primary industries in Queensland, the member for Barambah, was complaining about imported pork but he does not mind the Federal coalition wanting to put a tax of 15 per cent on the retail sale of pork produced in Australia. If we followed his line and banned imported pork, I wonder what he would say when the United States of America and Canada retaliated and banned our beef exports. I suppose he would then try to find a genie to pull out of his hat or to blame somebody else. The problem is that these cowboys need to get their facts straight if they want to get into the real world. If they want to talk about trade, they need to know what they are talking about, not simply to try to please the preselection process of their own local National Party of Australia and the League of Rights in the South Burnett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst aspects of the goods and services tax would be the inflationary effect at a time when Australia has inflation whipped and down to the best levels I have seen in my time. That gives us a competitive ability to see wool sold overseas. The Opposition would run inflation into double digits and destroy Australia's competitiveness. That does not make sense. The only reason that has been done is to shift the burden from the top end of town down to the bottom end, down to the Aussie battler, to make them pay for food, for meat, fruit and vegetables.

What did honourable members opposite do? They opposed one of the most equitable taxes we have ever brought in. That money goes into the family allowance supplement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I listened to the chairman of the country task force of the Prime Minister I wondered whether he really understood the country. I always find his comments quite disturbing. As a member who has a large rural electorate, I hope he listens to what I have to say because our amendment tonight goes to the heart of the problem that is in much of rural Australia and certainly in much of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill this evening, I would like to direct my comments exclusively to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The legislation before the House is designed to correct deficiencies in the administration of the scheme. The requirement to lodge original purchase invoices with each claim will be removed and during 1992 the Government expects to present new regulations to enable invoices to be replaced by a schedule of fuel purchases prepared by the claimant. I must say that this is a sensible approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me to ignore the more alarming deficiencies, and indeed inequities, in the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Diesel fuel rebate exemptions fall into nine categories. They are farming, forestry, commercial fishing, residential premises, mining, medical institutions, hospitals, nursing homes and aged people's homes. I have to wonder how the Government arrived at these categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a bit like a game we used to play when we were kids, pin the tail on the donkey. The Government is not sure what it should exempt, how it should exempt and where it should exempt so it is taking a wild guess and, as I said, it is a bit like pinning the tail on the donkey in order to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that exemptions exist denotes the importance to the belief, upheld by the coalition forces&mdash;the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia&mdash;that taxes on business inputs should be fully rebatable. As we examine the list further, we can see that mining and farming are eligible for a diesel fuel tax rebate. But what about Avgas? What about petrol that is used in these industries?  So often a petrol-driven machine is seen working beside and complementing a diesel-driven machine. We are faced with the ridiculous situation where a diesel-powered machine is operated tax free while its petrol-driven counterpart is subjected to fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House an example. I hope the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) is listening because he has condemned these amendments tonight. Just look at the statistics of how many new tractors, new headers or new harvesters have been purchased by farmers over the last nine or 10 years. There has been very little investment in new machinery. There is a very good reason why this is so and it is certainly one of the reasons agriculture is in decline, because farmers have not been able to afford to upgrade their machinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take a diesel-driven harvester out in the paddock harvesting grain. There are still quite a lot of petrol-driven machines harvesting grain. There is the diesel-driven machine, with no tax on it, going down the paddock and beside it is one driven by petrol, with a tax on it. It delivers the grain into a truck and the grain will be taken to the on-farm storage. The truck will be a petrol-driven truck, or it could be a diesel, but in either case this same inequity exists. If a farmer has a diesel harvester, he will get a rebate; if he has a petrol one, he will be paying the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grain is delivered to the silo, the on-farm storage. As many as 99 per cent of farm elevators putting grain into silos are petrol-driven machines. They are not machines that drive along the road; they are stationary engines driving an auger, putting grain into a silo, yet the farmer has to pay tax on the petrol. If it is a diesel machine, he gets it tax free. I have never seen a more glaring inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Aviation gasoline, which is used in agricultural aerial work, including mustering, is also subject to a fuel excise. The farmers and graziers are footing the bill for airport infrastructure and air traffic control that they derive no benefit from. Avgas excise amounts to $6.5m per year in the agricultural sector. These machines, helicopters and light aeroplanes are used in mustering; they are used in the day-to-day operations of checking waters and fences on properties. They rarely see a civil airport. Most of the maintenance is done on the property, yet the farmers and graziers are paying $6.5m a year in avgas excise, for no benefit. It is purely and straight out a tax on the day-to-day operation of the farm. Another good point about our Fightback package is that we are going to abolish fuel tax. No ifs and buts; no diesel only or petrol. It is diesel; it is petrol; it is avgas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another blatant inequity is the example of the commercial fishing boat, compared with the tourist vessel. Whereas the commercial fisherman can claim a diesel fuel tax rebate, the tourist operator cannot. I have to ask the honourable member for Hinkler why the commercial fisherman can claim a diesel tax fuel rebate but the tourist operator cannot. Does this mean that the Government is placing a greater emphasis on the commercial fisherman over the tourism operator who takes the boat out to the Whitsundays or the Barrier Reef? We all know how important the tourism industry is to us, so why should we want to discriminate between the two? After all, tourism is Australia's fastest growing industry, the largest private sector employer and the biggest earner of foreign exchange for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must qualify `biggest earner'. In Question Time this afternoon the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) said that it is a very important industry&mdash;and I acknowledge that; it is. However, it provides gross income to the nation, not net income. I hope that the Minister takes note of that. Whilst we may earn $7 billion a year gross from tourism, Australians also travel overseas and spend almost the same amount out of the country. Nevertheless, tourism is a very important job creator, and I ask why we discriminate between the commercial fisherman and the tourism operator. I really do not believe that we have had an adequate answer from any members of the Government in their speeches. It is just a case of the Government not knowing the donkey's head from the donkey's rump&mdash;to revert to my `pin the tail on the donkey' analogy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The diesel fuel rebate scheme is absolutely riddled with inequities. For example, why are residential premises entitled to a diesel rebate on electricity generation, while electricity authorities are not? I have four or five towns in the west of my electorate: Bedourie, Birdsville, Windorah and Jundah, all of which get their electricity through the electricity authority putting a diesel driven generating plant in their towns. They are very small towns, but those electricity authorities pay fuel tax to generate that electricity for those small towns. Yet if the electricity were generated at a residence, there would be no tax. I suggest to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) that he would certainly have been well off in here tonight addressing some of these problems, because he would have quite a few towns in his electorate with similar problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Fuel tax was originally introduced for the sole purpose of funding road maintenance and construction. Over the Labor Government years, fuel excise tax has been used to fill the Government's coffers. It has become a revenue raising mechanism. It is not being used for the original purpose for which it was brought into this House. Despite a 120 per cent increase in fuel taxes over the Labor years, road funding has fallen by 20 per cent in real terms. I know that that contradicts the honourable member for Hinkler, who I notice has left the House. I guess it is just that he does not like to hear the truth of the matter. Furthermore&mdash;and conveniently for the Government&mdash;it is no longer necessary to introduce legislation to increase excise payable. It is adjusted automatically twice a year with the CPI. It requires only the stroke of a pen. Surely this is a case of inflation breeding more inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The railways of Australia are a very important part of our infrastructure. In 1990-91 the Australian railway systems consumed a massive 514.3 million litres of diesel fuel. The railways paid a total product excise on that fuel of $130.14m. This Government has just woken up to the fact that it had better do something about these shiny railways. It is saying, `We have been using them as a revenue source, but now we had better start putting some of the money that they have been paying all the time we have been in government back into the rail system of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Government railways alone&mdash;and this will interest the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table&mdash;paid $23.75m to the Federal Government in excise. A lot of this fuel tax ultimately is paid by the consumer. I would have thought that the honourable member for Hinkler might have stayed in the House and listened to this because he has cane trains in his electorate. The cane industry is a very important industry in his electorate. These cane trains are pulling cane from the farms to the crushing plant, and they are attracting fuel tax because they are diesel driven. The passengers, the tourists who come to Australia, pay the fuel tax in the price of the ticket they purchase to travel the coast of Queensland on the railways. In Queensland alone, $23.75m worth of fuel excise was paid to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition government is going to abolish fuel tax and replace it with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. However, this GST will be refunded to business inputs, saving the Australian railways, for example, $130.14m. That is not an insignificant amount. It is a massive amount of tax which ultimately is paid by the consumer. So often it is an export industry that is paying that tax because so much of our export commodities are moved by rail for some part of the journey. The coalition is not talking about dabbling with the existing flagging wholesale sales tax regime; we are talking about comprehensive reform. The impediments to production propagated by this Government must be removed for Australia to have any hope of becoming internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to touch on another aspect of fuel tax&mdash;the iniquitous way it affects local government, particularly in my electorate of Maranoa. It is an area of immense agricultural resources and wealth, very much like much of rural Australia. It is a very large rural electorate. It is three times the size of Victoria. Flying from east to west is the same as flying from Brisbane to Launceston. Like much of rural Australia, it has been unrecognised by this Labor Government. The Labor Government has actively promoted policies to eliminate rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Barcoo Shire, which is in the electorate of Maranoa, covers an area of 61,900 square kilometres&mdash;about one-tenth of the size of the electorate itself, which is 625,000 square kilometres. Barcoo Shire has a population of 454 men, women and children&mdash;about 120 families. The headquarters of the Barcoo Shire is at Jundah and there is another office in Windorah. The outstanding figure, however, is that the gross value of agricultural production for this area amounts to $31.7m. That represents the combined work and effort of about 120 families&mdash;as I say, 454 men, women and children. Last year the Barcoo Shire alone used 390,000 litres of fuel at an average cost of 66.6c per litre. Therefore, the Barcoo Shire paid a fuel excise bill of $90,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a ridiculous situation in which we have graders grading the roads in these shires, paying diesel fuel tax, then constructing roads and paying tax.

It is a shire with an area of 94,690 square kilometres and a population of 243 people&mdash;about 50 families. The gross value of agricultural production and the combined work and effort of the people within the shire amounts to $15 1/2m. That figure is down a bit compared with the figure for Barcoo. The reason is that, in the last four to five years, the Diamantina Shire has been totally destocked because of the TB and brucellosis eradication campaign and is only now starting to restock. Even with those low stock numbers, the latest figures show that $15 1/2m&mdash;mainly in export income&mdash;has been generated in the Diamantina Shire. </PARA>

The sealed roads are around the towns of Bedourie and Birdsville and a little way out of town; yet last year and the year before, it sent $75,000 to Canberra&mdash;and it will probably have to do it again this year. What has it got for it? Nothing. Most of the roads are unformed. They have 7.5 kilometres of sealed road out of a total 1,671 kilometres of road and they contribute $15 1/2m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the House this evening. The Government strongly opposes the amendment moved by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), the shadow Minister for small business, housing and Customs. In an attempt to have Fightback adopted by stealth, the Opposition has tried to sneak in this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that the honourable member for Forrest said that we should accept the Industry Commission's reports in toto. I am not sure that his colleagues, the National Party members, would accept that view in relation to the dairy industry. I think the Industry Commission's view on the dairy industry is radically opposed by the members of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest made a couple of points and I would like to address them. He sought assurances that the new agreements contemplated in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill for the Compile system would involve consultation. Naturally that is the case, as has always been the case with these measures in the past. Usually agreements will deal with technical matters, including training, commercial agreements, fees payable and other terms and conditions by which parties will communicate using the Compile system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the agreement we outlined the rights, deliberations, liabilities and indemnities of the users of the system. With the Customs Service as the receiver of messages transmitted via the system, it is, therefore, appropriate and essential that the potential users be consulted on the proposed terms of any new agreement. I assure the honourable member for Forrest that this will occur in the new Compile user agreement in the Bill, as occurred when electronic lodgment was first introduced Australia-wide on a completely contractual basis in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest was critical of a lack of consultation in this process. It may stand as a valid criticism if this was a new proposal, but this proposal has been around for approximately two years. It mirrors the EXIT program that was introduced. The electronic lodgment initiative is not new. I wrote to the honourable member for Forrest on 25 February about the proposal and provided him with a great deal of detail. As usual, we offered a briefing and any exchange of information that he required. His office contacted my office on Friday. His office spent considerable time in discussion with an officer of the Australian Customs Service on Saturday. The office of the honourable member for Forrest also rang, leaving a message for the officer to brief him on Monday of this week at 8 o'clock. Unfortunately, as is normal, that was before the officer arrived at work, and then it was too late, according to the honourable member for Forrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing out of the ordinary in the way this Bill has been presented. A substantial amount of detail has been provided to the honourable member. It has been nine days since this Bill was introduced in the House and debate is taking place this evening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are ostensibly debating what is called the Government's economic statement, but I suggest the term is a misnomer; rather, it is a political statement. Its aim is to preserve one job&mdash;the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;and it is surely destined to fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast between the coalition's Fightback proposals and the Prime Minister's random mishmash of unfunded promises cobbled together with a wish list could not be greater. The unemployment problem this time around is worse because of the disappearance of a large number of unskilled jobs during the 1980s. Many of those jobs have disappeared forever. In the light of that stark occurrence, we need to examine the nation's skill base and ensure that Australians, and especially young Australians, are learning the skills that a modern, internationalised economy needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast of the Government's package with the Liberal-National coalition's program is dramatic, for the coalition has put forward a coherent strategy for jobs for the 1990s. The coalition's approach is to concentrate on growth through the creation of a more flexible economy, freed of the damaging centralised industrial relations system. Reforms to communications, the waterfront and transport will cut business costs and encourage new jobs in exporting industries. Enterprise bargaining and voluntary employment agreements will make wages, salaries and employment conditions more flexible; open job opportunities for young people; lift productivity; and create more wealth, more savings and, more importantly, more jobs. Education and training reforms will lift the skill levels of those seeking employment through more competitive, responsive and accessible training institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become painfully obvious that the Government is walking away from a whole generation of young Australians and burying its head in the sand over the extent of unemployment among young people. One reason for that may be that, in an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> earlier this week, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) showed himself to be completely unfamiliar with the statistics relating to youth unemployment. In fact, in answer to a question from Richard Palfreyman, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are far fewer young people actually looking for work . . . about 450,000 back in 1982-83. The number is now about 290,000.</PARA>
<PARA>That happens to be totally fallacious. The Minister has, in fact, shown that he cannot read a simple table. The figures that he quoted are the figures for those in employment in those two years in the 15- to 19-year-old category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the total number of unemployed, one finds that in 1983 there were about 216,000. The figure today is about 218,000. The actual rate of unemployment has risen amongst young people from 25.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent. The number of underemployed young people has gone up from 58,600 to 105,500. It is quite clear that the Government has no real conception of the problem and its extent. This is revealed by this dramatic blunder by a senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need to integrate economic reform with education reform. Without the latter, without a better educated, better skilled work force, we as a nation will not be capable of taking maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by a modern, internationalised economy in a truly competitive and productive Australia. Does the Government make the vital connection?  Does the Government acknowledge the overriding importance of education and training on the way not just to economic recovery but to fundamental restructuring and revitalisation of the Australian economy? The answer would have to be a resounding no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One indicator of the difference in scope of Fightback's comprehensive policy for education and training and that of the Government's `One Job' package is the sheer amount of space the two documents devote to education and training. The Government's package gives seven pages to education and training and to the labour market. Fightback contains a comprehensive strategy covering 57 pages for education and training and a further 14 pages on labour market training programs and active assistance to help the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These differences in scale reflect enormous differences in substance. On the one hand, Fightback presents program decisions across the whole field of education and training, totalling some $3 billion for new programs across this decade, together with a comprehensive strategy of structural change for making schools, TAFEs and universities more responsive to the needs of those they serve. Fightback provides a comprehensive alternative to Labor's doctrine of mediocrity and bureaucratic control, a doctrine which dooms young Australians to falling further and further behind their peers in other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's statement exemplifies the fact that education and training policy under Labor lurches from one preoccupation to the other, without any coherence or focus. In this statement schools are almost entirely neglected. The rigid centralisation and regulation of higher education which has locked out 50,000 qualified young Australians is maintained, and the focus has shifted almost entirely to TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before turning to what the Government has done in relation to TAFE, let me draw the very clear and sharp contrast between the approach of the two sides of this Parliament to schools and to universities. There is one commitment to schools in the Government's package:  an increase of $7m this financial year for upgrading facilities and equipment in non-government schools and to underpin increased student retention rates. Next year there will be a one-off $15m increase, and the following year a one-off $8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that has to be said about these increases in capital support for infrastructure spending is that they are derisory. Since 1981 the real value of capital grants per pupil has declined 29 per cent. Massive contributions to infrastructure spending are increasingly being called for from parents who want to exercise choice in their children's schooling. Existing needs and projected new needs for new schools have been costed by the National Catholic Education Commission at about $1 billion, yet on the present formula some 73 per cent of the capital expenditure will have to come from parish and community sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The families who have suffered most from the Government's irrational and ideological opposition to parents exercising schooling choice for their children are low income families. They are the ones who are most disadvantaged by the Government's efforts to prevent them exercising choice. Fightback proposes a major commitment of resources to assist low and middle income families to exercise educational choice. Under a Hewson Government capital support for non-government schools will be doubled and per capita grants for low and middle income parents will be increased by up to $490 per annum per child. Parents will also have opportunities for choice within the government school sector expanded by a schools of choice program for state school systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback recognises what the Government does not: that there is an urgent need to lift standards across schooling, to lift standards of literacy and numeracy, and to improve language skills and levels of attainment in vital areas such as science and technology. Fightback recognises that to do this there must be a proper monitoring of standards and a willingness to invest in quality teaching. A national standards monitoring program will be established and major professional development initiatives for teachers undertaken. Under Fightback the aim will be to encourage excellence and foster choice and opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Mr Keating's economic statement have to say about these vital matters? Nothing; it is all too hard for Labor and so the caravan moves on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Government's policy for universities, the gross over-regulation of higher education is a prime reason why thousands upon thousands of young, and not so young, Australians are currently being locked out of the system. The savage inequity in the system which allows overseas students to buy a place but denies that right to Australian students is enforcing an artificial cut-off&mdash;a dividing line that says who will have the benefits of a tertiary education and who will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of the coalition will return autonomy to the universities to manage their own affairs and will remove them from the centralised industrial relations system which has locked them into rigid and inflexible structures in regard to conditions of work and salaries. The commitment of increased resources to higher education in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Fightback is double that of the Government's statement, and the Government has failed completely to face up to the issue of structural reform and the creation of a student market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make one thing abundantly clear, because from his remarks earlier today the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) pretends not to understand: the coalition has an absolute commitment to fund at least an equal number of places for students as is provided for in the rolling triennial program. Therefore, any suggestion whatever that access to higher education will be narrowed by the coalition's program is totally false. The system will be better resourced, will have more places, and will therefore be more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, I regret to say, is intent on spreading disinformation about the coalition's policy. It is deliberately seeking to confuse people on the issue of full fee students. The Government's suggestion that under the coalition policy most students will be paying full fees or something approaching them is completely untrue. All students who are currently funded by the taxpayer and who meet their educational obligations will continue to be funded by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is proposing that students who do not otherwise have access to university should be allowed to gain entry on fees negotiated between the university and themselves. At present, these students are excluded completely by the Government's system of quotas. But, unlike the Government, the coalition believes Australian students are entitled to the same rights as overseas students. The Government's deliberate scare tactics do it no credit at all, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister has never proffered a satisfactory explanation for his refusal to accord Australian students equal rights with overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that TAFE has at last caught the Government's attention is welcome. There is undoubtedly a pressing need to lift the level of skills in the work force and to give young Australians training of international standard. TAFE was badly neglected by the previous Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). His preoccupation was the amalgamation of the universities with the colleges of advanced education, and TAFE was simply left out in the cold, with no attention paid to how it might relate to the new mega-institutions the then Minister was intent on forcing into existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deveson and Finn reports finally showed the tremendous needs there were in this area. Fightback made it clear that the coalition accepted the targets for growth in the training system set out in the Finn report. In particular, the Liberal and National parties accepted that by the year 2000 we should aim to have 50 per cent of 22-year-olds with at least some formal training certification, diploma or degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went further than that, however, and set out a comprehensive strategy to lift the capacities of the training sector to meet the needs of young Australians&mdash;and, indeed, older Australians seeking reskilling. This strategy involved an unconditional and immediate commitment to increase TAFE funding by some $520m over the rest of this decade. This was a fully funded commitment within the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also involved a commitment to work with the States to put them on a sound financial basis so that they were in a position to make their own financial commitments to fund growth in the TAFE system. This is a commitment we were able to make because, unlike the Government, we indicated we were prepared to accept, as a proper basis for discussion with the States, the tax sharing arrangements put forward by the Premiers which were rejected by the former Prime Minister in his panic about the challenge by his successor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Government, we did not rule out the possibility that a genuine partnership with the States for the development of TAFE was a real possibility. These two commitments together were effectively Finn option two. For ideological reasons, the Minister has preferred a complete Commonwealth takeover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has followed the lead of Fightback and recognised that there is a need for the Commonwealth to put additional resources into TAFE on a continuing basis. The new promises of TAFE funding in this statement are increases of $70m a year for each year in the 1993-95 triennium. These increases are, however, conditional on the Commonwealth getting the agreement of the States to surrender funding responsibility, and effectively control&mdash;whatever the Government may say&mdash;to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also states that it will develop a new and expanded system of institutes of vocational training. This new system will build on the TAFE network. There are no details about this new system. There are many questions to be asked about it. What will its relationship be with the schools and with higher education? When the Government talks about flexible use of funds for public and private providers, is it referring to a voucher scheme? Clearly, the Government has not thought this issue through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to take part in this debate tonight on the subject of the Government's One Nation statement which, undoubtedly, judging from the reception that it has received from everybody in the community&mdash;apart from the Opposition in this Parliament&mdash;seems to have hit just the right note.

I think it has been a great credit, not only to the Government but particularly to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that in very difficult economic circumstances the Government has been able to put together a plan for recovery&mdash;a plan for long term expansion&mdash;which has so obviously hit the right chord and attracted support from the overwhelming number of people in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that it has received support from a wide ranging group in the community. This ranges from the trade unions on the one hand to&mdash;and I mention this group particularly&mdash;the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales on the other. I think it is indicative of the fact that this Government is acting in the national interest. The nature and name of the statement, One Nation, picks up a theme which I think illustrates the fact that this Government not only is concerned for narrow sectional interests&mdash;as is so obvious from the policies of those opposite&mdash;but also stands for policies which seek to benefit the whole of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales.

<PARA>That is some praise from an organisation that I think historically could be described as not a particularly great friend of Labor. When we see the way that this statement has been so well received across the community is it any wonder that we hear from the Opposition the carping, irritated comment that it is annoyed that the business community has received this statement so well. When one looks at the statement, it is quite obvious that this Government has gone for an approach which is overwhelmingly in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to further reports following the Prime Minister's statement. It was interesting that in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on the same day, 2 March, in articles in a column called `Monday Money' one of the articles written by Malcolm Newell was headed `Benefits of the Keating Plan'. Another article in the same area was headed `Hewson Policy Misses'. I think that tells a pretty interesting story about the general attitude in the community to the issue of economic recovery. On the one hand the Government that, after all, is responsible in this nation for putting us on the road to economic recovery has put in place a responsible, effective plan which will lead to economic recovery, which is in the national interest, and which has picked up the best of all the ideas that were put forward by community groups, business, small business, the unions, social policy lobby groups and others. On the other hand, we see an Opposition that has sought to put in place a policy which is called Fightback. When we look at Fightback we can now get a clear impression of the differences between the two parties. There is no doubt the community is rapidly appreciating the difference. On the one hand we have a vital, effective economic package which has been put in place by the Government; on the other hand we have an effective one dimensional approach to policy by the Opposition&mdash;a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing about the Opposition is its inability to be able to develop a real and effective policy in the economic area. It has been its flaw and its failing for close on a decade now, and it certainly does not seem to be able to get out of it. As the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions, when we look at the Opposition's package it has really been based on assumptions about what it could do that was different from the Government. As I said a moment ago, the Opposition has come up with one dimensional policy making&mdash;a GST, a GST, a GST. What is the solution to the economic problems&mdash;a GST. What is the solution to unemployment problems&mdash;a GST. What is the solution to environmental problems&mdash;a GST. What can help Fitzroy win the next premiership&mdash;a GST. That is the sort of approach the Opposition has got. It seems to have no policy settings at all, except simply applying a 15 per cent consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Opposition now that the community will not wear it. Members of the community will not wear this consumption tax; they are not interested in it at all. When the next general election comes around the community in Australia will resoundingly reject what the Opposition has put up. As far as I am concerned, that will be an important and strategic point in Australia's history because I believe that, once and for all, consumption taxes will have been put off the political agenda in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that New Zealand is suffering very badly as a result of the consumption tax. One only has to look at the article by John Morine that appeared in the January edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Small Business and Investing</EMPHASIS> magazine headed `The G.S.T.: How Will You Cope?'. It referred specifically to small business and made some very telling points. It is clearly the case that, under the Opposition's proposals, small business will be the tax collecting agent for the Federal Tax Office. It is also the case that people in the small business community are now starting to realise that. In that article Mr Morine made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This article has disclosed a number of strong arguments against the introduction of GST. Of these, the most persuasive is that complying with the GST legislation will require business to divest itself of about 20 per cent of its resources. This serious redirection of resources will lower the business income subject to company income tax by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying, of course, is that small business will be spending a huge amount of its resources on collecting this tax and on paying the tax on behalf of the Government. People in my electorate who are in small business do not want a bar of this. When I have written to them, spoken to them at meetings or communicated with them, I have had the overwhelming response that whatever they do, they do not want to be tax collection agents. They do not want to be collecting this tax. Furthermore, they do not want to be paying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move to the next election we are going to see a realignment of forces in this nation. I think it is fair to say that traditionally many people in small business have been supporters of the Liberal Party, and possibly of the National Party. On this occasion we are going to see them deserting the Liberal and National parties in droves because they are now becoming acutely aware of the serious implications that the GST will have for them. When they look at economic recovery they will see that, on the one hand, the Labor Government proposes economic recovery&mdash;tax cuts without a 15 per cent consumption tax. On the other hand, they will see an opposition with few policy settings, but a flat-footed adherence to this GST whatever happens. I think we will soon enough see the results of that when the next general election comes around. Members of the community are going to reject the Opposition out of hand for seeking to thrust this unwanted tax on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my few remaining minutes, I want to deal with a couple of other matters. I am particularly delighted that the Government has chosen to implement such a wide ranging and important spending program in relation to infrastructure. I personally think this is long overdue, and I am delighted to see that we are now going to implement this program which will involve the expenditure of $1 billion on rail and road infrastructure over a three year period. I think it is well targeted expenditure. When I looked through the document produced by the Parliamentary Library on articles that have appeared in the national press in relation to the February economic statement, there was not one criticism that I could find of the Government's expenditure proposals in relation to infrastructure. That shows how well targeted the proposals are. Just to make it clear, there were comments in there that people wished other projects had been started as well, but I did not see one comment made in criticism of the projects that were chosen for special funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government introduced a package which will see an expenditure of $860m on increased payments to low income families over a period of three years. How welcome that was. That is $3 per week for many families. That will certainly be a very worthwhile fillip to many people in the community who are suffering at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in my own electorate there are many people who are doing it tough at the moment. I certainly sympathise with them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) on the Government's One Nation package. I remind the House that this is the fourth economic statement brought down in 12 months. That really makes one ask when the Government will get its policy settings right. Of course, we have also had four Treasurers in the same period. It really makes one wonder how this Government will hang together over the next 12 months, if it goes that far. That is the scenario in which we find ourselves debating the fourth economic statement in 12 months. This is the fourth time that the Government has tried to get Australia back on the rails after the disastrous eight years of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Makin, referred to our coalition Fightback package as being `one dimensional'. Of course, I reject that entirely. The package put together by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and our National Party colleagues is comprehensive, well documented and has great support out in the community. I want to indicate the support of our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for this type of initiative by quoting his remarks on changing and reforming the taxation system in Australia. These remarks are from 1985 when he recognised that Australia's taxation system needed radical change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia faces a clear choice: that it either does something about the high marginal rates impacting on average weekly earnings and finds another base in the tax system or it doesn't.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very clear choice. He is looking for another base to the taxation system. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a decent tax system, you can't in the long term keep a dynamic economy and you can't keep a fair country if only some of the people are shouldering the tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Who said that? Our Prime Minister. He described this much more extensively in three clear points outlining the reasons for and the advantages of a taxation system based on a GST. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say that if I believed that the proposed switch to a consumption tax would have dire consequences, I would not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what has happened. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main advantages of this tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>What is the GST all about? It is about doing away with the wholesale sales tax system. Our Prime Minister said that it was an anomaly ridden system which, he continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has multiple rates, numerous exemptions and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>No other tax, but a goods and services tax. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax and that provides a useful net dividend for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And earnings from this system, from accessing that black economy, will provide net income for the gentleman driving the tram.</PARA>
<PARA>He recognised that there were great benefits in a goods and services tax. Yet, as I said, in this package&mdash;the fourth one in 12 months&mdash;he has not introduced that tax which he was proposing and which he fully backs. One must ask: why is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are having this debate tonight for two reasons: firstly, the Federal Government has to respond to a political set of circumstances to get back to setting the agenda and trying to be in front of the Opposition, because the Opposition has been running miles ahead of the Government; and, secondly, the Government has to re-stimulate the economy. There are two key factors in having this debate. There are political reasons because of the circumstances in which the Labor Government finds itself. We have a fourth statement in 12 months because the political reality is that the Government is down in the polls and the Prime Minister has to reassert his leadership in this country&mdash;or at least try to. Secondly, we have to re-stimulate the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the One Nation package include? In order to stimulate the economy, the Prime Minister says that we need to put in about $2.3 billion by July 1993. He says that there will be a one-off family payment in April 1992&mdash;not far away&mdash;of $317m. I guess that is for the Wills by-election. There will be a cut in sales tax on cars from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. There will be small business relief of $10m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate in the last two weeks has really focused on the Opposition's Fightback package and the Government's One Nation package. I believe that at the end of the day we will find that people will not study all the minutiae of both these packages, but they will ask about the credibility of the people putting those packages forward. I think it is here that we need to look at the record of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People know the record of our present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland. That record goes something like this: overseas debt has risen by 520 per cent from $35 billion in 1983 to $183 billion now. What a record that is! In 1983 that debt was $2,000 for each man, woman and child. It is now over $10,000 per man, woman and child. For a four-member family there is an overseas debt effectively of $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the balance of payments record, 1972-73 was the last time we had a positive balance of payments in this country. We have headlines now stating that things are looking good when we have a balance of payments deficit for the month of $800m. It is just incredible that this country has sunk to that level. There has been a quantum leap in the balance of payments problem for this country in the last eight years, and I will illustrate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous coalition Government the balance of payments averaged $4 billion a year. That has risen to $12.9 billion, or by 320 per cent, in a short span of time and is a negative balance of payments problem for this country. In addition, there was an incredible leap in bankruptcies in the years in which our now Prime Minister was Treasurer of this country&mdash;up 159 per cent compared with the Fraser-Howard years. The level of unemployment is the highest since the Great Depression&mdash;at 10.6 per cent. One could go on commenting about the record of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an incredible record, a record of achievements by our Prime Minister&mdash;record unemployment, record bankruptcies&mdash;and it goes into the social welfare side of our society as well, not just the economic side. We find that there is an increasing crime rate. Virtually every aspect of crime in Australia&mdash;rape, burglary, break and enter and so on&mdash;are on the increase at a far greater rate than the population increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teenage and young people suicide rates are up. Youth homelessness is an enormous problem in many of our great cities. There is disillusionment in the community with education, particularly in the tertiary sector. In schools around this country parents are concerned about falling standards. They understand that Australia is not keeping up with the rest of the world and they want a better product in our classrooms. There is a lack of vision. There are long hospital queues. Reward for effort is low. So people are finding life extremely difficult. That is the record of this Government. Last week the Government came in here with a package which it says will, as it is put in the second last line of the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . give back to us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">our sense of purpose and our confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say to the people out there: who took away our sense of purpose? Who took away our confidence? Why have people in Australia lost their sense of purpose? I say to the House that it is because of the so-called leadership given to this country and the economic policies of the last eight years. That is why people have lost confidence and that is why people have lost a sense of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to reward for effort, many people say, `Why should I go out and work when I am better off on welfare?'. This Government has taken away the incentive for honest, decent, hardworking people to work. One could give plenty of examples, but time does not permit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record we see here is one which, sadly, has affected the lives of many families in this country. People will not go through all the details of either of these packages but they will have a look at the credibility of the leadership of this country. When we look at that and measure up the record of our Prime Minister today, and when we look at some of the things he has said in the past, I am sure that people will have no doubt that they will elect a coalition government at the next election. Let us go back to some of our Prime Minister's notable quotes. In a speech on the 1988 Budget he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are well on the way to prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the honourable member for Blaxland was well on the way to the Lodge at that stage&mdash;I do not know. Maybe he was, but what about the rest of us? What about the other Australians out there, the one million unemployed, the young people out of work? Our Prime Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't destroy business activity, we won't destroy employment. . . </PARA>
<PARA>When was that? February 1990. Goodness gracious me&mdash;two years ago! And what has happened in that time? About 300,000 people have been cast onto the scrap heap of unemployment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't destroy business activity . . .</PARA>
<PARA>No, just another 15,000 or so small businesses went broke during that time. What an incredible statement. Why should Australians trust the honourable member for Blaxland when he made those statements in the recent past but has not delivered? There is no way in which the One Nation package will deliver long term benefits to this country. The Prime Minister said in March 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>What have we had? The worst recession in 60 years in the meantime. In 1991 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think a lot of the lay-offs are behind us. I think they laid them off last year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But what has happened in the meantime? Another 200,000 people are unemployed, out on the scrap heap. That is the record of this Government; that is the record of this Prime Minister. Over the next year the Australian people will be looking at the credibility of the Prime Minister and the record of the future Prime Minister of this country, the present Leader of the Opposition. There is no doubt what the Australian people will do when the next election comes around. They will abandon this approach to running Australia, the One Nation approach. It has been cobbled together in a few weeks in response to the Fightback package. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A little later in my remarks I will deal with the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon, in respect of credibility. I am sure that there is not a member of this House who does not feel for those wage earners and their families who currently are out of work and are looking for work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very clear and positive objective in the One Nation package brought down by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last week is to give a lift to the economy, to get economic activity under way, so that in the coming four years 800,000 new jobs&mdash;meaningful jobs, jobs that will improve the infrastructure and the economic performance of this country&mdash;will be generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be harping about the waterfront. It is fascinating that when the Opposition has learned a song about a sector of the economy it cannot forget it, and it is oblivious to improvements that take place between the time the song is learned and the current time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will push on to improve infrastructure, road and rail services, and the overall efficiency of the engines of this country. The $2.3 billion package of expenditure on rail, road and port connections will greatly improve our transport systems. Thousands of jobs will be generated in those industries. The cost of carrying out those works will be substantially lower because of the current flat state of the economy. Jobs will be generated by this investment in infrastructure, and works will be carried out at a substantial discount because of the keenness of competition. Those improvements will generate continuing economic benefits to the economy and, most of all, we will get an improved infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present state of the economy, this is the time to generate major capital works such as those announced in the One Nation package. I will not go through all the depreciation measures included in the package, but the short description of them is that they considerably reduce the period over which a business can write off investments in new plant and equipment. That will lead to an improvement in productive capacity, the generation of jobs, and an improvement in our competitive position both at home and abroad, and it will lead to decisions by companies to go into new plant and equipment. One company in my own area, the Hunter, is now looking at six new projects which have come back to live consideration as a result of the Government's package announced last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the tourism industry, the 4 per cent depreciation rate on tourism buildings and accommodation buildings will give a substantial lift to investment in the tourism industry and again create the infrastructure we need to deal with the growing numbers of tourists coming to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in my region, that investment in new buildings and structures will generate demand for steel and steel products that will flow through to BHP Newcastle and BHP Whyalla through the purchase of new steel rails. That will in turn help that region and the local economy and the people living there, and it will recreate jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added support is to be provided for young Australians in terms of assistance for apprentices: increased payments to employers to take on first-year apprenticeships, to retain second-year apprenticeships and to deal with other apprentices to enable them to complete their time or even to get back to work under group apprenticeship schemes. All those items will help the employment position and help us in our task of ensuring that, as the economy picks up, we have an adequate supply of skilled people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make mention very quickly of the rail improvements. The improvement to the national main line rail freight system is very welcome. I am very pleased that the Government is tying that investment to a corresponding improvement in operational performance. The first fundamental point is that there is better equipment and the second is that there are better ways of operating that equipment&mdash;the operational practices and the operational arrangements. I am pleased especially for my colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) that I see $3.5m being invested in upgrading railway workshops at Port Augusta. That is important. It is a great city and it is a great community. I must say something in respect of the local member; he has my commendation as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), that when upgrading takes place on the Newcastle to Brisbane railway line, particular care be taken to ensure that where bridges are replaced, they not be replaced on existing alignments which carry the old speed constraints. It would be useless to be squandering money by replacing bridges that are long overdue for replacement without straightening out the tracks so that trains can run at high speed on those tracks. In looking at the rail improvements to be carried out between Brisbane and Melbourne and right through to Adelaide, ultimately we are looking at a much more sensible arrangement between rail, sea and road, where each form of transport will be performing the task to which it is most suited economically, socially and technically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment in roads is again part of the continuing policy of this Government since 1983 to establish a national highway grid right round this country linking our State capitals and linking Adelaide, Alice Springs and Darwin, and Brisbane and Cairns. The addition of the Sturt Highway and the Newell Highway gives alternative links between Adelaide and Melbourne through to Brisbane. The Government is about bringing together the communities of this nation, bringing the markets and productive centres of each part of Australia closer together. Travel times are reduced and travel conditions are made safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we looked at tourism we found that 91 per cent of passenger journeys in this country are made by private car. So, regardless of what role trucks play, there is an expectation by Australians that there are safe and adequate road facilities for them when they move about their country. For many people in this nation there is no alternative. They do not have easy access to airports and they do not have access to rail services, and they do need road services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the assistance to small business. I will come to the goods and services tax a little later, but I want to state what this Government included in the package last week for small business. The package includes a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small and growing businesses, which will increase capital mobility and growth in that sector. There is a three-month extension to small business for 1991-92 company tax payments. There is no increase until 1994-95 in the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. There is a tripling of the funding support to $12m for assisting small and medium enterprises into export markets through the export access program. Small business, like all businesses in this country, will benefit from the improved depreciation arrangements. They will enable many of them to carry out plant replacement and plant and equipment upgrades that they would not be doing without the assistance of the increased depreciation allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the export access program there are smaller firms which do not have sufficient in-house expertise and resources to maintain their  own  export development  programs, and in that group there is a widespread, latent demand amongst those businesses to get out into the export markets. But they do not have the expertise or the backing. The export access program allocation of $12m will mean that something like 700 small businesses will now be able to benefit under that program rather than the 250 that were able to benefit under the $4m that was available in that program. It will improve access to the program by businesses in all States and regions of Australia and will enable additional markets, particularly in Asia, to be targeted. That is about doing something positive for small business, not something that is destructive of small business, to which I will refer in a moment in respect of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon talked about credibility. Let me say something about credibility and this publication from the Opposition, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. What I will quote shows the arrogance of this document and the arrogance that comes through persistently from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Anybody in this country who queries or questions what is in this document is treated with that same arrogance by members of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition. I turn to page 301 where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for a majority of groups, those in the lowest income decile enjoy above average proportionate increase in their real disposable incomes. Thus, the fairness of the package for the whole population stands up when put under the group-by-group microscope. The package is fair for all Australians: anyone who says otherwise does not want to face the facts;</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Opposition that does not want to face the facts. That has been evident this week when those opposite have been decimated by the Prime Minister and decimated by the production of the Treasury survey of the goods and services tax. I turn to the question of credibility. Page 116 of the document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key elements of our private sector strategy are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.we will continue to provide preferred tax treatment to the family home&mdash;in other words we will not tax the family home;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know who the author of that statement on page 116 was. I turn to page 225 under the heading `Calculating the Goods and Services Tax Impact on a New Home' where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of an average home the net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and petrol tax.</PARA>
<PARA>There are the inaccuracies, the misrepresentations and, dare I say, the untruths in that document. It is a fraudulent document; it is a sham. Let me go to the case of a family with two children and one income of $20,000 per year. I do not go to figures calculated by me or estimated by other politicians in this building; I go to the Taxation Commissioner's documents and his estimates of product consumed by a baker when it is assessing a baker's income tax return. The Taxation Commissioner over a long period has established that a baker uses for himself $178 worth of product and for each child between four and 16 years of age the amount is $89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I go through and add up the Taxation Commissioner's figures established for the consumption by a family of two adults and two children of the products of the baker, butcher, fruiterer-greengrocer, grocer and milk vendor&mdash;all the basic essentials that are currently tax free in this country without a goods and services tax&mdash;I get an annual purchase figure of $8,182. The GST on that is $1,226. The income tax reduction for that family under GST is $814. That family is $412 a year worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this cant this week from the Opposition about being worried about people on incomes of $20,000 and less is shown to be hypocrisy by those figures. They are not my figures. They are not estimates. They are the hard numbers used by the Taxation Commissioner in assessing the incomes of each of those categories of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we go to what GST is about. What those opposite are saying to people is, `We are going to get this country going. We are going to put everybody on their feet. We are going to impose a 15 per cent tax on everything you can put into your mouth and onto your back'. It is as simple as that. It is a brilliant plan! It will reduce inflation, despite its inflationary effects; it will reduce interest rates; and it will generate employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition reminds me of the salesman with the spiel who says, `Have I got a deal for you. I am going to put the price of bread, butter, milk, jam and fruit up by 15 per cent. But don't you worry about that, because you are all going to have more money in your pocket'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are not that stupid. They know that it is impossible and they know that what those opposite are trying to do to them is shift the tax burden from higher income earners down the line to middle to lower income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got time to go through all the examples. I have mentioned a couple of them. They are there. But in the case of small business the GST would be an absolute nightmare. We would go from 71,000 tax gatherers under the current sales tax system to about two million tax gatherers. It is not just the people in small business who are involved; it is all the other people doing transactions&mdash;offices, trusts and all sorts of associations. Even the punters get caught. Lotteries, the TAB, the racing industry are all exempt from tax under the GST, which means everything they buy is subject to tax. That means that even the odds go down for the punters. Those opposite could not even let the punters alone; the punters are caught up in it. But for average small businesses the cost of GST collection is about an additional 2 per cent per annum to their expenditure. On a margin of net 3 per cent, 2 per cent is most of the profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just refer to the Canadian example. I have one sentence to finish. This is the Canadian experience of the goods and services tax. I say this loudly and clearly to Australian small business. The statement is:</PARA>

It is really no wonder that there is at this stage of the week thorough confusion out there in the electorate about this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's only weapon has been to attempt to cloud the issues at every step. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has resorted day after day to his old tools of trade&mdash;invective, abuse, sarcasm, misrepresentation. But it is interesting that the word that has come up in this debate very often tonight&mdash;and I think this is the key word&mdash;is credibility. It seems that the focus is on the Prime Minister himself. It will be his credibility that will be tested at the next election. In fact, it will be tested sooner than that; it will be tested in the Wills by-election. People will not believe him. Why should they believe this man who has constantly and consistently misled the Australian people over the years that he was Treasurer? Nothing, I do not believe, will cloud that memory, for he stood in this place time after time and he went out into the electorate and misrepresented to the Australian people the extent of the problems that this country was facing. He lulled them into a false sense of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again in this debate we have been reminded of the things that the Prime Minister said. It started early&mdash;I remember, with my interest in economics&mdash;with the J-curve. We all went back to our economics textbooks to find out what this fantastic J-curve was. Day after day in here it was the J-curve that was going to save Australia. But the J-curve turned into a U-turn and we heard nothing about the J-curve. Then it was going to be the soft landing; it was just around the corner. For months and months it was going to be a soft landing and, `Oh, I won't let there be a recession. No, you can trust me. There won't be a recession while I am the Treasurer of this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For months and months we talked about this `r' word. Do honourable members remember the reluctance of the Government?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, this contest that we are facing in Wills, and ultimately in the country in the next 12 to 15 months, will be about credibility. I think that the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer of this country, did so much damage to the fabric of our society, to families and to young people. We have only to look at the unemployment rate among our young people to realise the damage he did there&mdash;so much damage that nothing will wipe the memory of his activities as Treasurer from the minds of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the die is cast. I think the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) knows that. I think Government members know that. They know that the odds are totally stacked against them at the next election; they are stacked against them because, when the chips are down, the Australian people will look at the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, and they will not believe what he said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fundamental criticism of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement has been that it is incredibly dangerous as a document; it is irresponsible and it is a desperate grab for votes. Of course, we have pointed out ad nauseam that it is unfunded, and in that sense we are saying, `Where is the money coming from?'. The Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) gleefully got up here one day and could hardly help himself explaining that if it were funded it would not be fiscal stimulus. It was really exciting for him to explain that little bit of economics to us. But the very point that we were making was that this fiscal stimulus at this time is very risky. In effect, in the short term there would probably be no effect at all, but the longer term effect is one of great risk. We could see the Australian economy plunge back into a boom-bust type cycle once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's credibility is once again on the line. He is prepared to take that risk. He is prepared to take further risks with the future of this country and with our children. I believe that, when it comes to the crunch, he will be rejected comprehensively by the people of Australia and that he will be judged for the way in which he did his job     when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, nevertheless&mdash;and I am not going to damn the Prime Minister with faint praise here&mdash;some initiatives in this One Nation statement that we applaud. Needless to say, the initiatives that I am talking about are ones that have come out of the Fightback package. He has at least picked up some of our policies. I represent a tourist based area and some of the policies that the Government is talking about in the tourism and aviation industries are indeed welcome. I was quite impressed that, when the Prime Minister brought down his statement, he actually used the word tourism. He started talking about tourism. We had not heard that from the former Prime Minister. Of course, we have had a series of fairly  lacklustre tourism Ministers. But at least there was a recognition&mdash;and I applaud that&mdash;that the tourism industry actually exists. The Prime Minister describes the tourism industry in his statement as one of the economic stars of the 1990s. I certainly agree with that. The changes that he announced in his statement to amortisation rates on tourist income producing buildings are welcome and they will allow buildings to be written off over 25 years instead of 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms of the tourism industry in recent times has been the extent of foreign ownership. That has certainly been an issue in my own electorate from time to time, although of course it is true that we would not have the hotels and resorts that we have without foreign investment. On balance, I am quite prepared to accept that there are positive benefits from that sort of investment. It has provided jobs and, of course, it goes on providing income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe&mdash;and I think all honourable members would agree&mdash;that it is desirable that Australian companies and individuals are encouraged to invest in tourism. There has been a marked reluctance on behalf of Australians to do that. I think we have not taken a long enough term perspective on tourism as a profitable area for investment. Perhaps our banks and financial institutions are somewhat at fault there and some of the people and countries that have been prepared to invest here have taken that longer term perspective. The Japanese are particularly notable for that, being prepared to take the longer term outlook and to accept lower returns in the short term with a view to recouping their investment and getting a decent return on it in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we find a recession around the world, we have now seen a marked downturn in foreign investment in this country and despite our best efforts to continue to attract that foreign investment, the extent of that downturn has become very marked. Foreign investment in the tourism sector fell from $3.9 billion in 1989 to $1.9 billion in 1991. That is a significant fall indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to see the tourism industry, to use the Prime Minister's words, as a `star' of the 1990s, we will have to provide infrastructure for the sort of tourists that we expect to attract to this country. The projections for tourism from overseas through to the end of the decade are very optimistic. If we are going to meet those projections, we have to have the infrastructure, the hotels and the tourist attractions in place for people to visit this country. Those accelerated amortisation rates and indeed the matching accelerated depreciation on other fixed assets&mdash;things that go in the hotels&mdash;are also welcome, with the increase in the rates for depreciation for those up to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Prime Minister's statement picked up a lot of the Fightback package in respect of tourism and aviation. The latter is one area in which I believe the Opposition's policies have been well ahead of the Government's. We have consistently been in favour of the third runway at Sydney Airport. The Government has constantly dragged the chain on that; it has been the longest, most drawn out process one could imagine. However, the Opposition has been way ahead in all its policies, while the shadow Minister has been way ahead of any of his counterparts on the Government side in recognising the potential that tourism has for this country. It has taken a former Minister of this Government, the honourable John Brown, to do what the Government ought to have been doing, and that is promoting tourism and making people aware of the potential tourism has in this country. We were not getting that leadership from the Government for a long time. It was only the other night that I heard the Prime Minister, for the first time, say something about the tourism industry. I congratulate him for that; it is good to see that the Government is catching up here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airlines are a very important part of the tourism industry. We have just witnessed a real fiasco in terms of airline deregulation. One can talk about the two-airline policy until the cows come home; the Government blames it on the Opposition&mdash;well, the circumstances were very different when it was introduced. We could have otherwise had a one-airline policy, but history shows that we developed a two-airline policy; eventually that went by the board, as it should have, and then we had deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite astounded when I realised how uneven the playing field was for the entry of other airlines into the airline industry. I am not going to go to great lengths to go in to bat for Mr Grey and Compass, but the plain fact is that it is a very uneven playing field. The reason for that is that there were no terminal facilities available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home airport of Coolangatta, all the terminal facilities there, without exception&mdash;even the old East-West terminal&mdash;are owned by either Ansett or Australian Airlines. When I say `owned', I mean they have long term leases. Immediately prior to  airline deregulation right across the country, the Government gave long term leases on all the facilities to Australian Airlines and to Ansett and only gave the backdoor entry to newcomers. In other words, there were provisions in the leases that any incoming operator was to negotiate with one of the existing lessees. Of course that meant that any new operator was going to be very much disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recognised that. I do not want to speculate on why it went ahead with those leases. One could attribute all sorts of motives to the Government but now the Government is talking about what should have been done in the first place, and that is provide common user terminals. The coalition has urged the provision of those for some time. We will go much further in respect of airport management. We will privatise airports. Coolangatta, my own home base, is an ideal prospect in terms of privatisation. It is one of the few Federal Airport Corporation airports that makes a profit, and I know that it would be a very attractive privatisation proposition for a local consortium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would also refine the role of the Australian Tourism Commission. We are committed to maintaining its funding but we will give it a much sharper marketing focus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This important debate affords honourable members an opportunity to reflect on the vastly different approaches to economic management offered by the Australian Labor Government and its conservative Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as are other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, is in a recession, which like booms and recoveries seem to be inevitable features of the business cycle. Downturns have occurred in the Australian economy every seven or eight years since the Second World War. The last two&mdash;in 1982-83 and in 1974-75&mdash;were greatly worsened by world recessions, while that of 1967 was diminished somewhat by the impact of the early Vietnam War boom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recession has in part been the international response to the stock market collapse of 1987 when, in order to avoid a repeat of what occurred in 1929, Western governments aimed to maintain confidence by boosting liquidity. Of course the situation turned out to be quite different from that of 1929, and the countercyclical measures used actually became procyclical. This caused problems with our external account via an overheated economy and action needed to be taken to restrain economic activity. Our own recession was then further exacerbated by the rural crisis and the downturns in some of our key export markets, particularly Japan and North America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key feature of this Government since its election in 1983 has been its commitment to structural change and building an open, competitive and vigorous economy with a diverse export base, making its independent way in the Asia-Pacific region. We have boosted the service sector and those competitive parts of manufacturing, reduced the economy's dependence on primary industry exports and reformed micro sectors of the economy which had suffered from the neglect of successive coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This commitment has always been accompanied by an emphasis on compassion and equity during this process of economic reform. Likewise, One Nation is not therefore simply a response to the current recession. It represents further progress in Labor's reform strategy of the internationalisation of the Australian economy and the maintenance of social compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition parties have also been looking at economic reform in the context of recession and last November released their own policy package, Fightback, which offers an alternative approach to Australia's predicament. I would like to say a few words about that. The centrepiece of the Opposition's package is the 15 per cent tax on all goods and services, which would raise about $18 billion net. That would be used to fund the abolition of payroll tax, petroleum excise and some customs duty which are paid now almost exclusively by business. The personal income tax cuts, biased heavily in favour of the well-off, will be funded by fiscal drag. This simply means that people pay more income tax as they go into higher tax brackets due to inflation, not due to higher real wages. These income tax cuts do not require a GST burden; they can be funded out of fiscal drag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also proposes a significant reduction in Government services and spending of about $6 billion net, which would actually have to be a good deal more severe than that because the revenue shortfalls have already been identified and do not come out in the Opposition's package. Fightback is nothing more than a set of proposals to redistribute income&mdash;and therefore wealth&mdash;from the needy to the wealthy. It is all about setting a few policy mechanisms and then forgetting about the recession. It proposes no measures aimed at economic recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Instead of providing an economic stimulus, the re-distributional effects of the Opposition's consumption tax and its large expenditure reductions can be expected to have an immediate contractionary outcome for the economy. It is, in other words, about government getting out of economic activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Commonwealth Treasury analysis released this week estimates that if Fightback were implemented the economy would not grow for some years to come, inflation would rise and overall as many as 70 per cent of Australians would be worse off. Table 3 in the Treasury's papers shows that all taxpayers earning less than $35,000 a year would be worse off under the Opposition's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this should not be very surprising, given the approach of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to economic policy. The Labor Party is quite happy to consult with and seek advice from those sectors of the community that actually run the economy: that is, business leaders, trade unions, the State governments, various statutory authorities and those who do or do not benefit from economic activity, such as the representatives of welfare recipients. Members of the Opposition, under the Leader of the Opposition, listen to no-one except the theoretical colleagues of the former professor from academia. So they ruminate about abstract concepts while we govern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me say that the process of government is not merely about setting macro-economic policy levers at the right setting. It is not about set and forget. Certainly, market signals must play a part, but within national, political and social objectives. Within this context, economic modelling is the preserve of the economic purist but is only one tool available to government. The Opposition, unfortunately, has made it an obsession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach is altogether different. By the end of 1991 the Government had become aware of the likelihood that this particular cycle would see a fairly weak recovery mode. The Government took advice on what measures were needed to force the pace of growth, and decided on a level of stimulus in line with the recommendations it received from a wide ranging process of consultation during the early part of this year. It received various recommendations from business, unions, welfare representatives, corporations and State governments. The stimulus that was agreed on by almost universal consensus now amounts to $2.3 billion, compared with what is effectively a neutral package from the Opposition. After four consecutive Budget surpluses formulated during the boom of the late 1980s, a deficit is now appropriate to end the downturn in the cycle and to speed up the recovery phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two principal advantages to the Government's package of measures. Firstly, the one-off social equity payment to families in receipt of family allowance, plus the permanent increase in family allowance supplement payments, provides a quick boost to confidence and expenditure at the cost of $300m. This is accompanied by an immediate reduction in sales tax and, therefore, the price of new motor vehicles. Secondly, all the other revenue and expenditure measures are designed not only to help stimulate economic activity but also to contribute to Labor's longer term goals of the reform of the micro-economic structure. The major measures include $1 billion for the upgrading of Australia's national infrastructure in order to boost the efficiency of our transport system, a restructuring of our electricity generating and supply grid, $750m dollars to expand and improve the TAFE educational system, and a new, more competitive, capital depreciation regime to reduce by half the write-off time for assets and to encourage investment in new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the One Nation package was formulated I, like many other people, was consulted by the Prime Minister on the appropriate initiatives to undertake. Not being short of ideas I, of course, wrote a couple of letters to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An avenue that was, of course, not available to honourable members opposite, who are being rather noisy. I suggested an injection of about $3 billion into the economy to stimulate economic growth&mdash;and, in fact, $2.3 billion was announced in this statement; a firm financial commitment by the Federal Government to the multifunction polis; the standardisation of rail links, particularly between Adelaide and other capital cities and ports; a tougher approach to the dumping of foreign products on Australian markets&mdash;and I am pleased to note the announcement of a tougher food labelling regime in this respect; some direct initiatives to assist the car industry so important to Adelaide, which has now received a reduction in sales tax; assistance to homeless people&mdash;there are a number in my seat, and the Government has announced the $5m package made available to emergency relief organisations during this year and the next, particularly to outfits such as the Salvation Army and the Adelaide Central Mission in the middle of my seat; and further assistance to the restructuring process in the textile, clothing and footwear sector, which has been granted an additional $61m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these measures are of particular benefit to regional economies such as that of South Australia. As a State with a larger manufacturing base than most, it is imperative that producers not be inhibited from investing in technologies that maximise productivity growth. The new depreciation rules will definitely advantage an economy such as that of South Australia. It is also imperative that we have efficient transport links to the rest of the country, and the standardisation of the Adelaide-Melbourne rail line will do this, as will the upgrading of the rail links to Port Adelaide and the expenditure of over $60m on highway improvements between Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the sales tax on new motor cars has already been of benefit to General Motors at Elizabeth and Mitsubishi at Tonsley Park, whose products fell by around $800 per unit. This reduction in sales tax and increased production will be of substantial benefit to the local automotive components industry. The multifunction polis at Gillman in Adelaide will also benefit from the contribution of $40m towards initial construction. The MFP is a key to saving Australia's future as an economy based around industries of the future and integrated into the Asia-Pacific region. But, before overseas companies can be expected to put their money into this project, the Australian public purse needs to show some commitment to the project, and this allocation of $40m dollars does just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note in passing for those, particularly honourable members opposite, who believe that such high-technology centres can be left entirely to the market for development, that Tsukuba City, North of Tokyo, which I visited last year&mdash;an extremely successful MFP&mdash;absorbed $10 billion of public funds before private corporate capital moved in to produce high-tech developments in any sizeable quantity. I do not believe we will need that level of public investment, but some will be required, and we are now giving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These and other measures outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document will return the economy to low inflationary growth, provide for the creation of 800,000 jobs over four years and, as the cycle moves on and up, return the Budget to surplus. In addition, the Government's package will deliver personal tax cuts so that most Australians will pay a maximum rate of 30c in the dollar without a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All this is in stark contrast to the Opposition's approach, which is largely passive. Labor is taking positive steps to kick-start and reform the economy. The Opposition, on the other hand, has placed a taboo on positive initiatives being taken by the Government. It appears that poor quality roads, decrepit railways and weak technical and vocational training can be fixed up by the imposition of a tax on cornflakes. It cannot. The rest of the community recognises that it cannot. There has been a hugely positive response to One Nation from wide sections of the community who were, of course, consulted during its formulation, including people such as business leader John Prescott from BHP and the former Liberal Party boss, John Elliott, as well as the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Opposition has dropped into paranoia mode and is now blaming the messengers who brought the bad news of this positive community response&mdash;messengers such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the ABC&mdash;and has then condemned the Treasury for doing its proper job and exposing the glaring weaknesses in methodology to be found in the Opposition's package, or mouthing the cliche `unfunded' for a program designed to be stimulatory, or shouting `inflationary' at a Government that has produced the lowest inflation rate for three decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public now has a base to compare Government and Opposition&mdash;either interventionist stimulation replete with social compassion, or a free market set and forget redistribution from the needy to the greedy. We can all see already which way the public is going to go. In fact, as we have seen over the last two weeks, Fightback is already finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After two weeks of parliamentary scrutiny, it is clear that in the first place its figures do not add up. But, if they did, what they would produce, all other things being equal, is higher inflation, no national income growth for a few years, no reduction in unemployment for the same period of years, and a huge redistribution of national income from needy families to business and to those on higher incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hope that some of my constituents from Adelaide are listening, I close with a message about what they can expect as an immediate result of this package, in case they think it is merely about macro-economic reform and changing the settings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 April 1992, a one-off payment of between $125 and $250 will be provided to family allowance recipients. In addition, low income working families on family allowance supplement will receive a boost to their payment of $3 per child per week. A two-child family receiving family allowance supplement will be more than $400 better off over the coming year. Job Search and Newstart allowees and pensioners and beneficiaries with children will have their additional child payments increased by about the same amount. If we aggregate these payments, about 9,100 families in the electorate of Adelaide, which I represent, will receive a total of more than $3 1/4m as a result of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. This money will provide a boost to local spending. Much of it will end up in the tills of local businesses, who will see what it means to get this economy going again, to kick-start it and to move it into the 1990s on a sound fiscal and economic growth basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel I owe the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) an apology. Since his entry into this Parliament at the last election, I have always regarded him as a lightweight. I now find myself having been under a misapprehension, because tonight he has told the House and his colleagues in the Labor Party that he has the ear of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister contacted the honourable member for Adelaide and asked him to help draft the One Nation economic statement. The honourable member for Adelaide, again as he has told us tonight, bravely rose to the occasion. He put pen to paper and wrote to the Prime Minister and, believe it or not, the Prime Minister almost entirely adopted the honourable member for Adelaide's suggestions. Good heavens! Here I am, having never heard him speak in the Parliament, having seen no evidence of his contribution to this Parliament, now finding that he was really a heavyweight behind the scenes. I<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>t is true that it is best in life to talk quietly and carry a big stick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the members of the Government would be interested to know that the true architect of the One Nation strategy was actually the honourable member for Adelaide, not the Prime Minister or the factional heavies. So full marks to the honourable member for Adelaide for telling us so modestly tonight that he has been a principal architect of One Nation. Why is that something he would boast about&mdash;if it were true, that is? For heaven's sake, he really ought to hang his head in shame for being a participant in what is essentially a political document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had to differentiate between the Fightback package of the coalition and the economic statement of the Government, I would say that one is a political document wholly and solely to buy the Government out of trouble, compared with a detailed, sophisticated, fully documented and fully funded economic statement. It is typical of the New South Wales right wing, which threw up the Prime Minister to occupy the Lodge, to reduce national interest to private interest and to substitute the job security of millions for the job security of one&mdash;the honourable member for Blaxland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the best way to sum up the One Nation strategy is to describe it as a `fingers crossed' strategy: let us buy now, borrow, and just hope that enough time will pass for things to improve so that we can just get into the next election. Even if the honourable member for Adelaide came down in the last shower&mdash;as it seems from his contribution tonight that he did&mdash;the people of Australia certainly did not. That strategy, one of deceit, most certainly will not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other aspect of the honourable member for Adelaide's speech that caught my attention, other than that self-proclaimed major contribution to the One Nation strategy, and that is that he said, remarkably, that the Opposition's Fightback package is passive compared with the proactive One Nation&mdash;in the terminology of academics such as the honourable member for Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is passive, is it, to abolish $9.6 billion worth of wholesale sales tax&mdash;the hidden tax that all consumers and businesses pay but are not really aware of? It is passive, is it, to reduce income tax by one-third, by $13 billion? It is passive, is it, to abolish fuel excise, currently at 26c a litre? It is passive, is it, to abolish the compulsory superannuation levy, and passive to abolish the training guarantee levy and customs duty, and the coal export levy&mdash;$20 billion in all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member speaks about an economic strategy needing to be proactive, he really means handouts, subsidies, tariffs, bounties, some way of a government choosing one industry, or a segment of an industry, to assist ahead of another&mdash;in other words, going weak at the knees, depending on which is the most powerful lobby group or special interest group. That is his idea of `proactive'. Our idea of assistance to industry is to remove the level of taxation presently crushing our industries and our businesses. People speak of assistance to export industries. We are abolishing wholesale sales tax, which is a $1.7 billion impost on our export industries. Overnight, they will be $1.7 billion more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get the terminology right. When the Government speaks of assistance, it means buying the votes of special interest groups by way of borrowed taxpayers' funds. When the Opposition speaks of assistance, it means real alleviation of the taxation burden and the clearing of the impediments for an efficient industry, such as reform of the labour market and the waterfront, and micro-economic reform of the transport and handling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not have any of the fantasy of the honourable member for Adelaide, with his vanity and conceit, proclaiming to us&mdash;and to his constituents, who no doubt will be the poor recipients of thousands of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> copies of that speech of his&mdash;that he is the Prime Minister's right-hand man.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is utterly reckless, as the honourable member for Goldstein advises the House. Moreover, according to Access Economics, our Budget deficit could be $9 billion. Remember that figure&mdash;$9 billion? I seem to remember that when the honourable member for Blaxland became Treasurer he threw that figure at the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and other members of the former Fraser Government, year in and year out. Of course, the $9 billion in 1983 never materialised. Eventually the honourable member for Blaxland had to come in and admit that there really was never going to be $9 billion. That was Treasury's worst case scenario, which never eventuated. Now the Government has told us that it has a deficit of $5.6 billion. It has borrowed another $2 1/2 billion, so it is getting very close to what Access Economics fears will be a $9 billion deficit. Is it any wonder that we now have a foreign debt of $145 billion net?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that those whom the honourable member for Adelaide declares will be listening to his burst of wisdom tonight will think that these billions of dollars roll off my</PARA>
<PARA>tongue easily. They do not. They are staggering amounts that cannot be easily dismissed. They mean that this Government is hopelessly out of control in its spending and, moreover, that the nation's borrowing debt is so heavy that it will plague generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have to understand that we will not solve the foreign debt very easily. An incoming government utilising the Fightback package can have a drastic effect on labour relations, the wage fixing system, the waterfront and the efficiency of our land transport system. Our rail freight is losing $5 billion a year. We never hear discussed that V/Line is losing $5m a day in Victoria. Moreover, the Fightback package will immediately boost business to the tune of the eradication of $20 billion. We can do all that, although none of us would be so foolhardy as to put a timetable on the benefits flowing back to the Australian people. But they do know that we will make an immediate start and, provided there is a change of attitude in conjunction with the fiat of a coalition government, I believe there is hope for this country and that unemployment can be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign debt cannot be easily erased and it is consuming up to 20 per cent of our monthly exports. We have a trading imbalance running to the tune of some $15 billion a year and interest repayments of 20 per cent on foreign debt. We have very grave problems. If there is one message that people need to grasp more than any about the Government's economic statement, it is this: the promises it makes are phoney&mdash;if not immediately, in the near future&mdash;because they are not funded. It is borrowed money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is already in significant Budget deficit and this further spending on infrastructure and expansion of the public sector will only add $2.5 billion to the existing $5.5 billion Budget deficit. I very much fear that will have the effect of pushing up interest rates, particularly as the Government enters the capital borrowing markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing to a conclusion, I again wish to put before the House the benefits of the Fightback package, particularly as they affect my rural constituency of Gippsland. The farming community desperately needs some injection of incentive, as do all small and medium sized businesses, big business, individuals and families. That is what is missing from society and from business communities generally: incentive&mdash;incentive for businesses to reinvest and grow, and to create jobs and incentives for families to take responsibility, especially in the education and health fields. Quite frankly, there needs to be a significant reduction in the level of business input costs and the taxation levels on working men and women and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we bring about that low cost environment so that input costs are reduced across the board, we will not get an economic revival in this country. Leave aside all the economic jargon and the huge figures. As I said earlier, their impact is often lost. People have asked me, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) and other colleagues, `What hope is there for the future? Australia is gone. What can we possibly do to bring about change?' The answer is simple: lower the burden of taxation on business and individuals so as to bring down the level of input costs to provide incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package has been widely received by the Australian electorate. We in the coalition do not rest on our laurels. We intend to go out and if we have to stand toe to toe with Government members and slug it out, we will do so because we know we have a blueprint for the future which outlines a vision of the Australia we want to bring about. We have won the confidence of the Australian people and we intend to retain that confidence and win the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it saddens me that, despite many months of professional and detailed approaches to both the Federal and the State governments and appropriate Ministers and departments responsible for our health services, many hospitals and nursing homes are facing a crisis situation of major proportions. No wonder many Australians today are cynical of government. We know that the major problem that exists within our bush nursing hospitals relates to the classification of those hospitals, excluding them from public hospital arrangements under Medicare. Unfortunately, the shuffling of responsibilities and buck-passing between the States and the Federal Government is confusing any satisfactory resolution of the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse, government policies and guidelines are continually changing, leaving these small groups of dedicated people extremely frustrated and almost beside themselves in trying to cope with the rapidity of such change. This Government, I remind the House, told us in 1983 that many smaller, acute hospitals throughout our electorates, particularly throughout rural Victoria, should build 10-bed nursing homes attached to their hospitals in order to ensure their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through community generosity and raising of funds, despite some horrific economic circumstances over the years, committees met these government policies and right across the State they expanded a wonderful range of health services that met the needs of the community in our towns and within our own rural environments. However, probably due to the mismanagement of our economy and the lack of government funds to meet the earlier commitment, the rules were changed. Now government criteria for a 10-bed nursing home has been extended to 30 beds. In my region the endeavour to meet this requirement is both frustrated and restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the health region of Ballarat is oversupplied with nursing beds, but two-thirds of these beds are available in the city of Ballarat itself. It is accepted that many beds are not needed there and can be relinquished. The fact is that they have not been relinquished and there are no formal procedures to ensure that relinquishment takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I plead with the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to meet the needs of these isolated communities. They are prepared to go way beyond any reasonable social obligation. They deserve better than conflicting periodical policy changes that can only be interpreted as divisive and destructive policies. These nursing homes have to expand to 30 beds to be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to two particular examples which are causing me concern. The Birchip Bush Nursing Hospital has just received a letter indicating that special funding will cease for Birchip on 31 March next if redevelopment does not take place. The hospital advised the Minister and submitted a redevelopment plan on 29 November last year. In other words, the hospital has met its obligations and has met the Minister's obligations, but before the proposal it has submitted&mdash;at the request of the Government&mdash;has been looked at or determined, it has been given an ultimatum that top-up funding will cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak for another hospital in my electorate, the Natimuk Bush Nursing Hospital. This hospital has accepted that it must meet the Government's criteria for a 30-bed nursing home. The hospital presently has a 22-bed nursing home and eight acute beds and is prepared to convert these acute beds and other auxiliary facilities to ensure a 30-bed nursing home is built. It is prepared to meet the Government's criteria and ensure that it not only meets the health needs of the community in an adequate way, but also that it meets the conditions required by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as I pointed out earlier, there is no commitment, no ability within the quota system, for nursing home beds to be transferred or to become available to meet this hospital's requirements. People living in isolated, remote communities have, through their own generosity and their own resources, contributed to the provision of health care and the wonderful range of services for the aged. It is totally unjustified and lacking in all social equity that these conditions should now be applied. Many of these facilities are new. They are modern facilities, equal to none in health care delivery and community caring. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely the Minister will not shut down these facilities simply because of conflicting government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise following your own speech on the adjournment debate yesterday evening in relation to Louis St John Johnson, who was viciously and brutally murdered on 4 January in Western Australia when he was on his way home from what was, in fact, his nineteenth birthday celebration. As you commented yesterday, someone was convicted last Friday in the Perth Children's Court for the murder of Louis St John Johnson. He received a sentence of seven years and nine months.</PARA></TALK.START>

I wish to add to what you had to say. The adopted parents of Louis, Bill and Pauline Johnson, who are constituents of mine, have formed the Louis St John Johnson memorial trust fund. They have written to me, and I am sure they have written to you also, Mr Deputy Speaker, to convey the objectives of this trust. </PARA>
