<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made that claim, which I repeat, in contrast to the sort of view of the Opposition that growth does not matter and that what one should do is keep a pool of unemployment to keep wages restrained and inflation low. They are the miserable policies of those opposite. They do not believe that the Australian economy should grow at 4 per cent or be able to grow at 4 per cent. After nearly 30 years in office, we were growing at 4 per cent and the demand spilled into imports; that is, you were able to build so little spare capacity into the economy that after 4 per cent growth it all rushed to imports. You should just hang your heads in shame because after 30 years here, while all the economies around us were growing at sixes and eights and nines, the best we could do in Australia before it spilled into imports was 4 per cent under the hopeless, dumb policies of the present Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result, the labour market is 25 per cent larger now than it was in 1983. We did not believe that a pool of unemployment should be there as a brake on wage demands, to hold inflation down. That is what the Opposition believes. That is why it is not committed to employment growth. That is why it is happy with low rates of economic growth. The very essence of economic policy is for economic growth, better living standards and higher incomes. Anyone who believes the contrary should quit the game. The Leader of the Opposition does believe the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>

Unemployment is at 11 per cent and causing real hardship for many. So we need growth, as I said a moment ago, at a sufficient pace to create lasting jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us now take a look at the heroic assumptions that underlie the particular propositions put forward by the Opposition. Those opposite said that they would trump us with a $945m proposal over our $720m proposal. The only unfortunate thing about that, of course, is that what they included under that is about $1.3 billion worth of Commonwealth expenditure. So in their extreme generosity to TAFE, they are talking about a $300m cut. But they still had $720m to make up. How were they going to do it? They would do it on the savings of Austrain they said. I am afraid that the Austrain savings were already incorporated within their Fightback proposals, so they are out. There are no Austrain savings to be included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest, the $720m, according to those opposite, would come off the savings to be gained from young people going off the dole. What does that produce? There is a reasonable estimate around that for every 100 people placed by wage subsidy proposals, 85 people are effectively put off. So there is a net gain of about 15. It is true that in some of our labour market programs we do better than that, but if that is the case&mdash;and this is so whether the subsidy is provided by the Commonwealth or by the young person going on to the $3 or $3.50 an hour rate&mdash;then a combination of these factors means that for every 100,000 young people taken off unemployment benefit and placed in a youth wage job, the net annual saving is about $85m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May this year there were 170,000 people under 21 on the dole, receiving an average of $100 per week. Even if every single one of these 170,000 suddenly decided to take a youth wage, which in many cases would pay less than their unemployment benefit, the total savings would be no more than about $145m, or $430m over three years. But Dr Hewson needs to find $720m if his new proposal is to be fully funded. So to get that level of savings, over 280,000 unemployed young people would have to go onto a youth wage, but there are only 170,000 of them available. The net total produced is nought. So basically Dr Hewson has to invent effectively another 110,000 young unemployed people and then get all 280,000 of them into subsidised employment in which they provide the wage subsidy.</PARA>

That is nearly 45,000 new McDonald's outlets at 15 per outlet.

Where do you get off in the float of the exchange rate and all the other structural changes which my colleague just mentioned? I remember some of the quotations by the Leader of the Opposition about the years that he was around with the then Treasurer, John Howard. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 6 July 1987, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We played quite a significant role in opening up the debate. We had success at the margin, but the whole thing was the big decisions were not taken&mdash;consumption tax, industry protection levels, fiscal policy restraint measures. It was very frustrating. Howard would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members bar the night before&mdash;even if we had four feet of paper on the table. The farmers could produce anecdotes out of thin air. I used to wonder a lot how much many of them understood. Decisions were made when we, the advisers, were kicked out. Having been there through the Fraser years and having been decisively rolled, he knows that if you have a chance to do something, you must do it.</PARA>
<PARA>So says John Hewson. The decisions that they were rolled on were the float of the Australian dollar; the removal of exchange controls; the reduction of the tariff wall; the shifts in fiscal policy; the change in the factor shares between wages and profits; the reformation of the tax system to give us a decent income tax regime which is not haemorrhaging all over the floor with bottom-of-the-harbour-type schemes and the rest; the absence of capital gains taxation and the double taxation of dividends; the changes in the waterfront, which nobody attempted in 30 years of coalition government; the changes in telecommunications, which nobody attempted in 30 years of coalition government; the shift to exports to elaborately transform manufactures, which this Government has presided over; and the 300 per cent increase in manufactured exports since 1983.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the reports in the paper. They are totally without foundation. They were made by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Wal Murray, a person who, I think, is known very well by those on the other side of the House. I remind those opposite of what he had to say about three-cornered contests:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a solution&mdash;a very simple solution: that is to get the hell out of Hume and Riverina.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that we are not the only ones having difficulty with one Wal Murray. He is the one to whom is attributed this quote that I have reneged on some package that I negotiated with the States. That is interesting because Wal Murray was not even at the meeting, and it is interesting because it directly contrasts with what the Minister for Agriculture, who was at the meeting, said in relation to this agreement. Ian Armstrong actually praised the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did Wal Murray get it wrong again, but also he put in great jeopardy the early payment to drought affected farmers in New South Wales and Queensland. He also put in jeopardy the finalisation of a drought policy which I will be announcing later this week on the back of the Budget. The simple fact of the matter is that I have had the opportunity to visit the two most drought affected areas in this country&mdash;the western division of New South Wales, as well as Queensland. I understand the hardship that is being experienced by those people, and it did impact upon me very strongly. But it also provided the opportunity to have genuine discussions with the people involved to identify precisely what we could do to assist them. This is what I announced some four weeks ago as a result of an agreement that I negotiated with the State governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects to the agreement. One goes to alleviating the immediate hardship for which I indicated a preparedness to provide $14m immediately&mdash;$14m which is being put in jeopardy by Wal Murray's statements, I might remind the House. Secondly, the other aspect of this was to ensure that we had a component in the drought policy which dealt with circumstances of severe drought. That is crucial to a national drought policy, and I am pleased to say that following the Budget tonight we will be able to announce a good policy direction in terms of a drought policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As far as the agreement itself is concerned, for the record, I agree to fund&mdash;in addition to the 50 per cent interest subsidy&mdash;dollar for dollar with the States up to, effectively, 100 per cent interest subsidy, as well as lifting the cap on the entitlement to $30,000. But I indicated to the States of New South Wales and Queensland that, because they had made money available through transaction based levies, on this occasion I was prepared to waive their requirement to match that dollar for dollar. In other words, the 75 per cent would be provided by the Commonwealth and it was a matter of judgment as to whether the States of Queensland and New South Wales would take it up to the other 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit disappointed that when the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Fahey, was in the western division recently&mdash;where he announced additional support for transaction-based levies&mdash;it was clearly within his capacity to allocate that funding to take the interest subsidy to 100 per cent but he did not do that. He persisted with the transaction based approach&mdash;the very approach which even members of the National Party on the other side concede we need to get rid of in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is that that was the agreement. The significance of this agreement can be realised when you combine it with the discussions that we have had with the banks over recent months whereby they have been prepared, in cases where the farm is long term viable and where the farmers demonstrate a commitment to increasing productivity and coming to grips with their terms of trade, to develop packages of finance for up to 30 years with interest only payments for up to 5 years. If we combine that capacity with what we have done in these extreme drought circumstances&mdash;a 100 per cent interest subsidy&mdash;we are meeting the very needs that the farm sector in the western division of New South Wales and in south-eastern Queensland has been talking about. Yet that very agreement was put in jeopardy by Wal Murray's announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made it clear to the groups that I have spoken to in these areas that this policy is based on securing the long term viability of the farm sector and not prolonging the inevitable for farms which are not viable in the long term. I must say that even in those drought affected areas that principle is accepted by those with whom I have spoken. In terms of viability, it has to be not only economically viable but also environmentally sustainable. As an indication of this problem, in that drought-affected area of western New South Wales we have circumstances where the livestock numbers are estimated at some 8.7 million dry sheep equivalents, whereas the estimated carrying capacity is 7.7 million, which is well under that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that this is good policy. We have come to grips with the development of a national drought policy which, as I say, will be announced, but at the same time we have given much needed relief to those farmers and to those areas that I visited and where I have taken note of it. It is sound policy. It ought to be applauded and you ought to be doing what is necessary to implement it and tell Wal Murray to pull his head in and stop jeopardising it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were the honourable member for Ballarat, I would not try using that word at all; he might not be here to hear the answer. The point is obvious that the word liar is an absolutely unparliamentary word and is not allowed. On numerous occasions in the past people have used the words `fraud' and `hypocrite'. In some instances they have been asked to withdraw; in other instances they have voluntarily withdrawn. Indeed, the honourable member for Ballarat, I am reminded, used such a word today. It is always useful if members of the House do not use evocative words such as that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes in Question Time language is used which, in the normal course of debate, would stand out very much and would probably be out of order, and in all debate it tends to be a matter of how the matter is perceived at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An incident at Parliament House on 12 August 1992, in which a four-wheel drive vehicle was driven through the main entrance of the building, has received a great deal of media attention. As honourable members may be aware, a number of agencies are involved in providing security in the parliamentary precincts. The President and I decided that an expert who was not attached to any of these agencies was required to provide an objective assessment of the incident and the Parliament's capacity to respond. We commissioned Mr Richard Dixon of the security division of Price Waterhouse to investigate the incident and make an immediate interim report to us on appropriate means to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dixon, who is a retired commander of the AFP, presented his report yesterday. A copy of the report has been made available to the party leaders and to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on a confidential basis. The two Ministers are the Ministers who are nominated by the Government as the Ministers responsible for liaison with the ministerial wing and with the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report finds that the actions of the security staff in detaining the driver of the vehicle and evacuating the public from the building were proper and effective. The driver has appeared before the ACT Magistrate's Court on four charges relating to the incident and has been remanded in custody pending the receipt of a psychiatric report. Mr Dixon's report contains recommendations for the installation of temporary vehicular barriers at the entrances to the building. As honourable members will be aware, the barriers are now in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will not be any overreaction to the incident by the President and me. The measures the President and I have put in place will not inhibit in any way the public's access to Parliament House. We have been very careful to ensure that the balance between open access and effective security is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dixon's report makes other recommendations in relation to the installation of more permanent barriers, the strengthening of building entrances, the management of security, the powers of attendants and emergency evacuation procedures. The President and I are considering these recommendations. In the light of the report, the President and I propose to commission a wider review of the protective security of Parliament House, which will include an examination of the risks to the building and its occupants, and the effectiveness of current arrangements in protecting against those risks.</PARA>

At present the AFP, the APS and, in some instances, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Parliament's own Security Controller and our attendants provide some of the security arrangements in Parliament House.

It was a short inquiry; it provided us with some recommendations. I understand that all the agencies involved are happy with the recommendations and, quite frankly, I think that the people who were involved in the response on behalf of our Security Controller and the other agencies acted quite well, as I said in my report and as the party leaders will see in Mr Dixon's report.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand there were a number of children in the hall at the time the vehicle came through and that the impact was quite alarming and devastating, particularly upon the young people involved. There were some children from a school in my constituency. Some parents spoke to me afterwards about what arrangements would be put in place to assist in trauma counselling for the young people who may have been so adversely affected by the impact. I have spoken to the New South Wales Minister for Education to ascertain what might be done in relation to this, but I wonder whether that matter has been taken up by you or the President and whether any action is being taken to ascertain the schools involved and whether, particularly where programs such as the one that the New South Wales Government has are not available, the Government will assist other schools that may have been here at the time the event occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>

The House reported the message the same day and considered and agreed to the 25 amendments contained in the Senate schedule. On 29 June, after the Bill had been printed for transmission to the Governor-General for royal assent, officers of the House were advised by the Australian Taxation Office and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that they believed that four of the amendments contained in the Senate schedule had not in fact been made by the Senate. This advice was subsequently confirmed by officers of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Who, as a result, has caused Australia to go into recession ahead of the rest of the world, deeper than the rest of the world and with a recovery more fragile than the rest of the world? None other than the ex-Treasurer, soon to be ex-Prime Minister, Paul Keating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two particular quotes that expose the fragile position of the Prime Minister this day, as correctly highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), concern cooking the books and fudging the figures. Back in 1982 the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Keating, told the Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask the Parliament: Where do we go in this nation when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury and responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australian nation can base some economic judgment, falsifies that document? It is the habit of this nation to have annual Budgets and Budget statements prepared by the premier department of the Government, the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said in 1982. Let us look at what the ex-Treasurer said in 1992; to be precise, 24 June 1992. Mr Keating, who was speaking as the current and interim Prime Minister of this country, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the claims by some of the pointy people is that I rewrote parts of Statement No. 2. Too right I have.</PARA>
<PARA>He was caught red-handed. He admitted that he had cooked the books; that he had falsified the Budget statements; that he has massaged the numbers massively in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background that I think it is time we looked at seven consecutive comments from seven past Budgets of this ex-Treasurer, now Prime Minister and soon to be ex-Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Let us look at his record. In 1984 Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policies are on track.</PARA>
<PARA>Some track! In 1985 he said that the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . builds upon our very significant successes and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He was wrong again. In 1986 he said that the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>He was wrong yet again. In 1987 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our economic strategy is now bearing fruit.</PARA>
<PARA>They were pivotal words in 1987. It has been downhill ever since. In 1988 the famous statement was made, and I appeal to people in the public gallery who are beyond the cocoon of Canberra to take note of it. In the Budget document of 1988, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation is successfully emerging from the most severe economic crisis in a generation . . . this is the one that brings home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>Some bacon! Shame on that person who uttered those words and who has failed repeatedly to bring home the bacon. In 1989 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will emerge . . . without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.</PARA>
<PARA>He made that comment in 1989, which was three years ago, on the equivalent Budget day. In 1990 he said that the economy will improve:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Seven times the Prime Minister has been caught out completely; seven times he has failed to deliver in terms of his own Budget rhetoric&mdash;which I accept that he wrote, and he has a right to present his Budgets in those terms. But, boy, did he get it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consequence has been one million people unemployed. A consequence has been a nation where the foreign debt has gone from $36 billion in gross terms at the start of this Government to over $181 billion. A consequence has been that Australian taxpayers, many of whom are hard pressed and are back to being single income families just above the poverty line, have been hit by bracket creep to a collective tune of some $22 billion. A consequence has been that wholesale sales tax&mdash;the existing consumption tax of 30 per cent, 20 per cent, 15 per cent and 10 per cent, which we will abolish&mdash;has crept up and up to rest at over $10 billion, a 60 per cent increase under the Labor regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the fuel excise tax on poor motorists in decentralised job locations trying to get to their job or hang on to their job in so many areas where there is no public transport and where the only alternative is to use taxis. What has happened? There has been an increase from under $1 billion at the start of the last decade to a $7 billion rip-off of the motorists now&mdash;an excessive taxation on the transport industry, adding to the burden of the drought and adding to the burden on decentralised firms still trying to maintain their employment base across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to make a real assessment of how our economy is travelling, perhaps we can look just briefly at Japan. It is not an exact comparison, but it is interesting to reflect that Japan has had over three times the productivity increase that Australia has had since 1983. France and Italy have had over double the productivity increase that Australia has had in that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that we have been marking time under Labor&mdash;and it gets worse. We have one million people unemployed. The official unemployment rate is 11.1 per cent. But in the State of Victoria it is worse. Thank God Victoria is going to the polls, although it is very unfortunate for those of us who are Vietnam veterans that it is on the wrong Saturday, on 3 October. But soon enough Kirner will be gone from the premiership of Victoria. Victoria, under a State Labor government and with a Labor government federally, has a youth unemployment rate of 46 per cent. What shame that a Labor government can deliver that outcome after having its hands on the levers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to pick up on a comment made by the new `El Presidente', the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) to wit, the man who came in to rescue and take over the presidency from Senator Loosley. Of course, Labor would have us believe that the rich would do far better under our policies. It is very interesting to examine the facts on this score, as `El Presidente' has done. He has admitted that the gap between the rich and the poor has got worse under the 10 years of hard labour that we have been subjected to in this country. None other than the honourable member for Lalor has been honest enough to admit that the gap between the rich and the poor has deteriorated, has worsened greatly, under Federal Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this Government came to power, single income couples on average weekly earnings have had a 4.7 per cent decline in their disposable income. Interestingly enough, single income couples on six times average weekly earnings have had a 6.7 per cent increase in real disposable income since Labor came to power. So much for Labor's rhetoric!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the ones with the fair dinkum policies that will provide equality. We are the ones that will get the monkey of the huge fuel excise taxes, the rip-off of every motorist in this country, off the backs of people and save them $11.40 every time they fill up an average fuel tank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this Government that has maintained secret consumption taxes of record proportions in Budget after Budget yet has the audacity to come in here and argue against our fair dinkum, fairly based and fairly structured policy to abolish seven taxes and replace them with one, fair, GST&mdash;a path which, incidentally, 59 other countries have gone down with considerable success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just add that Australia is one of the few countries persevering with a payroll tax. Here in Australia we have one million unemployed&mdash;massive unemployment right across the country&mdash;very little change, fragile economic growth and not enough to soak up that unemployment, yet the Government perseveres with a payroll tax. We provide the remedy to abolish totally all payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Labor's historians will have to explain the crippling debt, the incentive sapping taxation, the low productivity, the distribution of income away from average wage earners, favouring the rich, the chronically high unemployment and the underclass that the Prime Minister created&mdash;the underclass that this country did not have to have&mdash;in the same way as he created the recession that we did not have to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten budgets have greatly failed Australia to the extent that the big swing is on. In Victoria, we could even see a State seat such as Footscray go. Federally, the seat of Gellibrand could go to the coalition. Not one Labor member deserves to keep his or her seat in either the Victorian State Parliament or the Federal Parliament except for one, and I will tell honourable members who. I am prepared to make one exception: the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who had the courage to attack the Prime Minister last week in such a way that I thought we might even send him a National Party membership form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can deny that international factors impact on the Australian economy, but the level of incompetence of the Prime Minister has greatly added to that burden. Those figures are pretty serious. The steel industry in Japan last month reported another savage downturn, and that is going to have huge implications for the Australian economy. But what I will never forgive Labor for is keeping those interest rates so high and for so long. It was so arrogant and so out of touch. The Prime Minister boasted he had his hands on the levers of the economy. He got it totally wrong, and the one million unemployed are paying the price. The sooner the Prime Minister loses his job so that one million Australians might have a chance of getting their jobs back, the better for all of our sakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last week. The article started with a reminder of the four-year scenario contained in the One Nation statement, and stated that the centrepiece of One Nation was the creation of a rapid take-off of 4.75 per cent growth a year and a steady decline in unemployment. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, growth would equal the average of the last seven years of the 1980s, without the same blow-out in foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the Government has now walked away from those One Nation predictions. It has seen its One Nation statement go up in smoke. But, more interestingly, I point to the fact that the economic model on which One Nation was based has now been put under wraps and the public have been denied full access. Why? I quote from the same article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has since been decided that this cannot be done, sources revealed, because it would show where the numbers were massaged.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, massaged by the Keating prime ministerial office. The article detailed the Prime Minister's disbanding of the national income forecasting committee when he was Treasurer and its replacement with the joint economic forecasting group. It highlights the politicisation of this group and the way the figures were rewritten and rewritten, Budget after Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we can expect tonight is the great fudge once again, the great rewrite once again, the great falsification of what ought to be fair dinkum forecasts for the benefit of those who have to deal with the economic circumstances and the horrific drought which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) referred to in Question Time. I say to the Government and to the Minister that I accept that drought is beyond the direct control of government&mdash;clearly, the weather is&mdash;but there are ways and means of pursuing those policies which will minimise that effort. The Government has taken steps down that path, and the Federal-State stand-off has to be resolved. But I put it to those opposite and to the House that they are exacerbating the burden of the circumstance by their failure to adopt the fundamental reforms which would greatly ease the burden of taxation on hard-pressed, drought stricken farmers, primary producers, exporters, small business operators and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to that clear-cut example: even in drought, farmers are greatly exposed to the horrific cost of transport to cart fodder in and to cart livestock out to agistment and the like, and there is some specific assistance available to them. But underpinning that huge transport structural cost in this country is a level of taxation unacceptable anywhere else in the world. To quote Bob Hawke, transport taxes in this country are 3 1/2 times greater than in any other industry. What will we do about it? It is very clear-cut. We will abolish all sales tax, including all sales tax on trucks, spare parts, rigs, vehicles, and the like. We will abolish all payroll tax, including the payroll tax most large trucking companies have to pay, whether it is the Wee Waa trucking company, the Wagga Wagga trucking company or whatever. We will also abolish all diesel fuel excise tax and so provide the basis for a substantial lowering of those transport costs to help these people in a very positive way not only in a drought stricken circumstance but for the ultimate economic recovery which will be delivered under a coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to the House that this Government has had its chance. Enough is enough. It is time for a change. It is time to give the coalition a chance to deliver a fair go for the farmer, a fair go for the family, and a fair set of policies which will get economic recovery back on the rails and deliver fair dinkum private enterprise jobs and not the mickey mouse approach which has been too often followed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should stand condemned for his fudging and rorting of Budget documents over too many years. We have caught him out, and we are going to remind him of it at each and every opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am somewhat staggered when I look at the matter of public importance that we have on the business sheet for discussion today, with its fleeting reference to the drought and no solutions, from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It is an absolute disgrace to come in here with a matter of public importance to deal with drought and to suggest that we are going to solve drought by introducing a goods and services tax. If that is the bankruptcy of opinion within the National Party, then it is no wonder that its members are deserting it in hordes. It is no wonder that its leadership is resorting to thuggery to hang onto the few remaining seats that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want first of all to go to what the MPI says in terms of the Government's alleged failure to deal with drought, and then to deal with the other matters that the Leader of the National Party has raised. Firstly, in relation to drought, the Government will be announcing on Thursday of this week, following some important announcements that will be made tonight, a national drought policy. This comes after a long time of consideration, but I must say that the most difficult circumstances in which to develop a drought policy or to introduce it is in the middle of one. That has been the difficulty faced not only by the national Government but also the State governments, given that we have to get a consistency of approach across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also point out that, in the meantime, we have tried to get real assistance to all of the farmers in need, not just those affected by drought. We need to remind ourselves of the fact that, whilst we have a drought and have had one over the course of the last couple of years, it is nowhere near as widespread as the drought in 1982-83. But other factors that have impacted upon the farm sector have caused severe hardship and real difficulty. It is against that background that I set about using the existing mechanisms available to government, knowing that there was a reluctance on the part of the State governments to do much else than blame the Commonwealth for not spending enough, and to try to find the flexibility within the rural adjustment scheme which provided substantial resources to assist farmers in hardship for whatever reason, but including drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a substantial injection of funds into the RAS. Substantial new flexibilities were introduced into the interpretation. There was the deadlocked agreement broken by me with the States in getting part B activated. I would simply remind the House that, for all the bleatings that the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales goes on with about the amounts of money that it has spent on drought, the fact of the matter is that the New South Wales Government has still spent only just over half of its 1991-92 allocation of $8.4m under part B of RAS, which is intended to provide the very means of carry-on assistance that farmers affected by drought require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to the House that the reason why this has not been spent is that the New South Wales Government has to match $1 for every $2 of ours expended under part B. We have heard a lot of talk this afternoon about the definition of the word `hypocritical'. That must go down as one of the most hypocritical statements by the National Party and the New South Wales Government in trying to pass the buck to the Commonwealth but not exercising the opportunity available to it to provide the fullest amount that we have made available, when we have been prepared to double the contribution as against its $1 of contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that we have provided close to $50m in 1991-92 through RAS support for farmers in New South Wales. In addition to that, we introduced the new income support approach for farmers who could not incur any additional debt but who needed to get food on the table. When I visited the western division of New South Wales, I was applauded by a very large meeting that gathered in Bourke for having introduced that initiative. Despite the press releases that are put out from time to time by the National Party saying that this has not worked, the fact is that it has targeted real need and it is well regarded by those who have been recipients of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we had to change drought policy is that in 1989, after a report into the then current drought arrangements, there was unanimous agreement that the policy had to change. Why? There are two basic reasons: firstly, the previous system had been rorted and no more had it been rorted than in the State of Queensland under a National Party led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Honourable members should remember that most of his Cabinet are now disgraced because of the way in which policy had been run in that State. The policy on drought was rorted. Just to give an instance of this rort, we had the circumstance in some shires in Queensland where between the years 1964 and 1989-90 areas were drought declared 70 per cent of the time. The focus of those recipients of drought benefits was a very small group compared with the overall farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the transaction based subsidies which the States still want to continue do not discriminate on the basis of need, nor do they encourage farmers to make provision in the long term, to treat drought as a natural recurring feature and to adopt risk management policies. The policy has to be changed not just because of the rorts but because the policy thrust has been bad. We have to treat drought as a naturally recurring event; we have to convince farmers to prepare for that event; and we have to equip them with the wherewithal to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no disagreement, from all the farm leaders I have spoken to, about the general direction, although there have been difficulties associated with implementing a policy to reflect those factors. The two sticking points are, firstly, how we deal with the circumstances of extreme drought and, secondly, how we come to grips with the new funding arrangements under the rural adjustment scheme, given that that will be the centrepiece of the delivery of drought and other assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to advise that, finally, at a meeting recently held with agricultural Ministers we reached an in-principle agreement which is subject to announcements that will be made tonight within the Budget. I undertook to go back to Cabinet and argue for these commitments. I believe that as a consequence of the Budget tonight we will finally be able to announce a drought policy for this country in the immediate future. It will be a drought policy based on sound policy initiatives which have been talked through with the constituency and which complement the thrust of economic and long term viability, better and more sustainable land management practices and the initiative that we recently announced: the landcare and environment action program for the young unemployed in this country. The policy is to put a labour component, together with the capital dimension that is there, to address these landcare and environment related issues to make our rural system more sustainable. We will also announce changes in the not too distant future to RAS to make sure that it goes in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the Leader of the National Party did not give us an insight into the Opposition's drought policy. Those opposite seem to think that the GST and Fightback are a panacea for everything, but Fightback does not even mention drought. To suggest that to eliminate taxes will solve drought problems is arrant nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the assertion that the abolition of seven taxes will be a great boon to the rural sector. I have already abolished one: the coal export duty. Apart from the fact that that reduces the taxes from seven to six, it does not mean terribly much for the rural sector. When have those opposite gone out and told the farmers, `We have got a great deal for you. We are going to abolish the coal export duty.'? The farmers would just look at those opposite stupidly, and they deserve to be looked at stupidly. Of the remaining six taxes, three predominantly will not apply to the farm sector: payroll tax, superannuation and the training guarantee levy. Why? Because farmers in the vast bulk of cases do not pass the thresholds that require those taxes to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the three remaining taxes, we will exempt one almost entirely with the amendments that we have made to the wholesale sales tax. The wholesale sales tax is now only one per cent of the cost of production for the farm sector. The big benefit that is proposed for the farm sector is the fuel excise. But the question still remains: how will the coalition fund its roads program? Abolishing the fuel tax will cost the Budget $6.8 billion. One either has a great gaping fiscal hole&mdash;and those opposite have talked this afternoon about the need for fiscal responsibility&mdash;or one has to raise the revenue through other road user charges. Yet the Opposition still has not come clean and said which of those options it will exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback is quite clear: Fightback says it will be done through a user pays principle. The NFF analysis that has been through the ACIL report assumes kindly, I would suggest, that only 50 per cent would be recouped. What does that mean for users of diesel consuming equipment who do not pay any excise now but who will be slugged with the road user charge to meet the shortfall? Why have members of the National Party not told their people about that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last of the remaining so-called seven taxes is the customs tax. The customs tax and the issues that relate to it are causing enormous difficulties for the National Party, as it well knows. It has already had a resignation from the front bench. The tax can only be abolished if all tariffs are also abolished. We know that the Opposition has been agonising about the difference between negligible and zero. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewston) argue that protection support or support in lieu of the tariff can be given through the exchange rate, and we have seen a good example of how that might happen in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be very surprised if farmers really believe, on the Opposition's say so, that their industries will be looked after by the exchange rate because, every time the exchange rate is mentioned to me in meetings, farmers say that they do not have faith that it will take account of their concerns. The point remains that we cannot get rid of the customs duty unless tariffs are abolished. The Leader of the National Party needs to contemplate this point very carefully. He is either stuck with his commitment to zero tariffs or he cannot deliver on one of those tax cuts. That is what he is stuck with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the impact micro-economic reform has had on the farm sector. We have heard today that nothing has happened. We have had a good response from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on that point. I will mention some specific areas that have had an immediate and lasting impact on the farm sector. In shipping, the average crew size has been reduced from 33 to 21 since the end of the last recession. That has seen a reinvestment in this country of $2 billion in Australian flag vessels. Five years ago that would never have been thought possible, but it has occurred because of our commitment to and delivery in shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In waterfront reform, the Australian Wheat Board has estimated a $10m a year saving from a reduction in stevedoring costs. Australian ports are now regarded by the Wheat Board as amongst the most efficient in the world, yet the Opposition goes around saying that no reform has taken place. In rail transport, Australian National has reduced its call on taxpayers by 70 per cent since 1982-83. We also have a strategy to reduce costs in electricity and a number of other government business enterprises. It is nonsense to suggest that no reform has taken place; it has. We will continue to deliver good policy. Whilst those opposite go round with their heads lopped off not knowing where they are going, the people in the electorate will turn to us. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

He says that sales tax does not affect farmers at all. He has been running this line for over a year now. We have seen him embarrass himself in Question Time by saying that sales tax does not apply to two-wheel drive petrol utilities, et cetera. Treasury's own figures show that $288m in sales tax is paid by farmers. Surely the Minister cannot deny his own Treasury figures. He also tries to disparage Fightback. The Treasury document, which the Government itself set up to see whether it would benefit farmers, says quite clearly that farmers would be better off by $1,025m. That translates into $160 for the average farmer every week for the rest of his or her life. The Minister has knocked that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think debate in the House on a matter of public importance whereby the outright fibs the Government has been telling us constantly over the last 10 years are exposed is long overdue. The litany of deception that this Government has fed the Australian people to stay in power is a sad record. The only extraordinary thing about it is that Government members have got away with it for so long. Today in Question Time we heard the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reeling off supposedly good thing after good thing that they have done for this country. When their answers were finished, those who had listened to them could conclude only that Australia was some sort of nirvana; that we had died and gone to heaven and everything was well.

The money that we send out of Australia every year in the interest payments on that is more than we are spending on health, education and defence individually. The tragic thing is that that will continue to go up for some time&mdash;such momentum has been generated by this Government's policies.

This is supposed to be the party of compassion, but it is totally ignoring the desperate plight these people are in. No area has been hit harder than the western area of New South Wales. As my new electorate will take in 40 per cent of New South Wales, I would like to say something about that. At present, 73 per cent of New South Wales is in a drought. Most of that area is in the second year of drought and some of the area is in the third year of drought. The little bit of rain we had the other day, 50 or 100 points through most of that area, will not do much good at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the traditional drought that they are suffering at the moment of little water, no feed and dying stock; they are also suffering a financial drought, in large part caused by Federal Government policies. The Minister sits there looking at me. There is no better example of what the Government has done than the emasculation of the IED scheme. Had it left that intact back in 1983-84, people today would have been in a better financial position to get through the drought. The Government removed drought from the national disaster relief scheme in 1989. Despite numerous inquiries, despite a drought policy review task force reporting over two years ago and despite a Senate standing committee being formed to bring out a national drought policy, the Government is only now starting to act in this area. The drought will be over if it is not careful and does not act soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has allocated $14m for farmers in extreme drought in New South Wales and Queensland. I urge more Government members to get out there and see what it is really like. We just heard a speech by the Minister in which he told us how he went out there and inspected it. I was told that he flew into Bourke, was there for a couple of hours and then received a call saying he had to be back in Canberra because the Prime Minister wanted to talk to him. The reason the Prime Minister wanted to talk to him was that the Prime Minister was launching a CD that night. That was the Minister's trip into the drought-stricken area of New South Wales. </PARA>

The Department of Social Security will tell them it is not working. Everybody knows it is not working, except them.

This is the pressure that is put on families who have no income and cannot pay their bills, yet are still producing something for Australia.

They turn on the radio to hear a bit of good news, to hear what the Government is doing for them, and what do they hear? The Reserve Bank is propping up the dollar, keeping the exchange rate artificially high so that, if they do finally get a bit of wool to sell, they will get less for it than they really should be getting.

I also recently visited Walgett, Lightning Ridge and other such areas. The people out there are certainly going through a very difficult time. Like the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), I have been receiving constant reports on that area from Barry Brebner, who happens to be the Labor Party candidate for the area in the next election. He also has great concern for the farmers in that electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes mentioned a Treasury document from which he cited a $1,025m increase in farm income because of the GST. In fact, if we look at the farm sector we see that the total is $797m because, in the $1,025m figure, agriculture as well as forestry, logging, fishing and hunting are included. The real point is that it is incomes only; it does not take into account the expenditure of farm incomes and, of course, expenditure affects people's living standards just as much as their incomes. When that is taken into account in that document&mdash;the same document that the honourable member quoted from&mdash;we find that 60 per cent of farm households will be worse off. That is really the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite amazing when members of the National Party get up and start talking about mismanagement, especially in relation to drought. The Minister has already alluded to the history of drought in Queensland, which is the State experiencing the most severe drought at present. Between 1964 and 1989&mdash;the Minister has spoken about this, but I think it is worth repeating&mdash;some Queensland shires were drought declared 70 per cent of the time. That is mismanagement; it is about putting resources where they should not go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcements at that time were triggered by the State of Queensland under Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Honourable members should understand that three-quarters of the drought assistance went to only 16 per cent of properties. That is a problem. It was mismanagement for two reasons: firstly, that assistance was going to the bigger farms; and, secondly, because it was going to the wrong places and because those decisions had been made wrongly, those people who deserved and warranted the assistance were unable to get it at the right time because it had already gone to the wrong people. That is what inefficiency and mismanagement are all about. So when members of the National Party get up and start talking about mismanagement, especially in relation to drought, they leave themselves open to enormous criticism because of what they have done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should think about the structural changes that have taken place in the last 10 years, the economic direction of this country in the larger scene and the potential that this has given Australia to be on the path to prosperity. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) talked about Japan, but he has started talking about Japan only in recent times. He should go back and look at Japan and other countries which have prospered since the postwar period. They prospered because their manufacturing industries went out and competed with the rest of the world. They produced goods and exported them. Australia missed the bus in those postwar years. Our secondary industry was protected by high tariff walls which produced enormous inefficiencies. Our mentality was closed: we supplied only the Australian market and, because of that, we were unable to compete on either price or quality with what the rest of the world was producing. </PARA>

But changes have taken place in Australian industry. If we look at the export figures of manufacturers we see that industry leaders are taking the initiative and are taking up the challenge. We are starting to compete in a whole range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has to be looked at in a wider context. In the postwar decades, people would come along to see Black Jack McEwen and say, `Hey, we've just given the workers a rise. We can't afford to keep selling at the price that the imports are coming in at', and Black Jack would say, `Righto, we'll give you a bit more protection'. That was passed on and the people who paid for it&mdash;apart from the ordinary consumers of Australia&mdash;were, by and large, the primary producers. This is where we have changed things. If we look at the average effective rates of assistance to the manufacturing and agricultural industries between 1973 and 1991, we see that the gap has narrowed markedly from about 12 or 13 per cent to in the vicinity of 2, 3 or 4 per cent. That is real progress for the agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement on the national drought policy is a real step forward. It says, `We are going to take a new direction; we are going to talk about planning and management on farms', rather than just give one-off handouts as the National Party would like to do. It has initiatives including funding a communications strategy for the national drought policy, funding education and training, supporting additional measures under Landcare, funding research and development, ensuring better coordination of research and development, restructuring the rural assistance scheme, implementing a revamped IEDS, phasing out State transaction-based drought assistance, and additional finance under the RAS for farmers in severe or extreme drought. That includes the $14m which is to be split between New South Wales and Queensland and which the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales has put at risk through his statements which really show a lack of knowledge of the issues involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise this afternoon to address the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. Although I have never been to Norfolk Island, I know that long ago when Captain Cook first discovered Norfolk Island he described it as a paradise. If honourable members look at the records of Captain Cook, they will find that on his travels he did not call any other place which he discovered a paradise, so it must indeed be a paradise. It is a pity that some hearings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works were not held on Norfolk Island on occasions, because perhaps I would have been there then. One day I certainly will make it my business to go there. My parliamentary duties have prevented me from making it to Norfolk Island, such are the more pressing issues in my electorate like drought and Government mismanagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will enable certain residents of Norfolk Island to vote in parliamentary elections and for other purposes. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory</EMPHASIS> of March 1991, reported that Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island remain the only resident Australians not entitled, as a right, to representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. The Committee received representations indicating that Norfolk Islanders themselves had mixed views regarding representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. However, it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the right to vote is an absolute right which should not be denied to those people of Norfolk Island who wish to exercise their right. However, the Committee recognises that the constitutional history of the Territory is complex and that Norfolk Island warrants special consideration in this regard. In addition, the Committee is cognisant of the strongly held views of the elements of the Norfolk Island population, most likely a majority, for whom Commonwealth parliamentary representation is an anathema.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is aware that provisions exist within the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for optional voting for the following categories: an Antarctic elector; an eligible overseas elector; or an itinerant elector. The Committee is mindful of the strongly held views and the historical reasons which make Norfolk Island a unique case. The Committee is therefore prepared to accept, contrary to the important principles which apply anywhere else in Australia, that the residents of Norfolk Island who are Australian citizens should have the right of optional enrolment. Once a citizen exercises this right, voting would be compulsory and normal provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act would apply.</PARA>
<PARA>The report recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Parliament amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to give optional enrolment rights to the people of Norfolk Island; the electorate to which the voters would be attached to be determined on the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government response to the report tabled on 10 September 1991 agreed that optional enrolment recognises the unique circumstances of Norfolk Island and provides those Australian citizens who wish to exercise this basic democratic right the opportunity to vote in elections for the Federal Parliament. As a result of the Norfolk Island plebiscite on voting rights for Australian citizens, the then Minister for Territories, Mr Simmons, suggested that for the purpose of Australian Federal elections Norfolk Island voters would be aligned with a single electorate, namely Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Norfolk Island Government has lobbied against the single electorate proposal and for compulsory voting for all Norfolk Island residents. The current Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, has backed down and has now introduced legislation which enables Australian citizens to enrol in an electorate of their choice. In this case she has accepted the strongly held view of the Norfolk Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to extend to Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island the opportunity to vote in Federal elections and referendums. This is consistent with the coalition's repeated views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to provide a form of optional enrolment to eligible Norfolk Island residents to enable them to enrol in mainland&mdash;Australian Federal or State&mdash;electoral divisions with which they can establish a connection. Where such a connection cannot be established the option of enrolling in particular Territory divisions will be available. The Bill will also amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to allow those Norfolk Islanders enrolling in this way to participate in referendums, as required by section 128 of the Constitution. The electoral provisions of the Bill will have negligible impact on the Commonwealth revenues and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a minor amendment to section 56 of the Norfolk Islander Act 1979 in relation to the travelling expenses of judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court to encompass travelling allowances and to place beyond doubt the legality of past payments of travelling expenses purportedly made under that section. The Norfolk Island Government meets and will meet the travel-related cost of judges visiting the island from its own Budget. The amendments to the Norfolk Island Act will therefore have no impact on Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. The coalition supports this legislation. It has been a fairly long time coming, but it is sensible and it has certainly taken into consideration the wishes of the people of Norfolk Island in its drafting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the general thrust of the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in responding to the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. I should at the outset say that there is no element of a retreat of the kind that the honourable member suggested from the proposition that was advanced for compulsory voting. The Government has never endorsed such a proposal. It was not part of the recommendations in the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory</EMPHASIS>, presented by the relevant subcommittee, which I chaired, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; nor at any stage was it an element of the Government's response to that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a degree of modification from the recommendations which were unanimously put to the Parliament by the Committee, that is, that optional enrolment rights would be provided to the people of Norfolk Island, the electorate to which voters would be attached to be determined on the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission. The basis for that was constitutional advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that it would be not possible under the Australian Constitution to provide for the right of residents of Norfolk Island to vote as electors of a State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the time of the publication of our report the Government of Norfolk Island, anxious to avoid the consequence whereby electors on Norfolk Island would of necessity have to vote in an ACT division, which would have been the likely outcome of the Electoral Commission's determination, sought further constitutional advice and provided that to both the Government and to members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The thrust of that advice was that measures of the kind which the Government has now adopted were compatible with the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I remain somewhat sceptical of that legal advice as a matter of principle, but of course there is unlikely to be any plaintiff willing to litigate the issue. It now is a measure which commands the support of both sides of politics. The Government of Norfolk Island, which has been very sensitive about this issue, is now content with the measure. No doubt any potential litigant, other than those parties, would find it difficult to establish standing to bring the matter before a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in a sense we have a happy solution to a very hotly contested issue. It is difficult now, as we debate this matter before parliament, hearing the gentle remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa and the remarks that will be made in the debate later by members on both sides of this chamber, to recall some of the heat that previously existed in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the Committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>. The heat in the report is reflected at paragraph 7.10.2 where the Society of Pitcairn Descendants expressed in evidence the view that `. . . we do not want to be part of Australia . . . we are not Australians'. As a consequence of that assertion there were very strong representations to us that it was entirely inappropriate to facilitate in the least degree the possibility of Pitcairners or any other residents of Norfolk Island participating in Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That required the Committee and this Parliament to reflect upon a very fundamental divergence between the wishes of probably a majority of the people of Pitcairn Island and this Parliament in terms of its responsibility to those who are not part of that majority. I will turn later to the question of the degree of strength of that asserted majority opinion, but let us concede, from the point of view of this debate today, that there still possibly remains a majority of residents of Pitcairn Island who would prefer that no person resident on that island be given the right to vote in an election for the Australian Parliament. That is a view with which the Committee could not agree, and it said so plainly and bluntly in terms that were referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a point that I reiterate as Chairman of the subcommittee that took evidence. It seems to me that it is entirely unacceptable that any citizen of this country, no matter how remotely he be resident, no matter in what circumstance he lives, be disenfranchised from the right to participation, democratically, in the electoral processes of this country. It seemed to me an enormous blot on our democratic traditions that we had for so long facilitated a situation where the residents of Norfolk Island were not enabled to undertake their democratic rights of participation in elections to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the particular circumstances of the island are very different from the rest of the country is reflected in a unique compromise which permits a voluntary enrolment rather than a compulsory enrolment, as is the case for the majority of Australian electors. The reasons for that are provided in the report. But it is very important to make the point that even if there had been only one Australian citizen on that island and not the many that were seeking to vote&mdash;even if there had been only one&mdash;it would have been entirely improper for the Committee to have reported otherwise than in the terms in which it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to deal with is a little more broad. This debate today is of a somewhat narrow compass, but it leaves open the opportunity to respond to some of the other issues which were raised in the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>. This particular legislation deals creatively and successfully with the issue of representation of the people of Norfolk Island in the Commonwealth Parliament. I certainly look forward to the participation in the forthcoming Federal election of such of those members of that community who seek to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other elements of the report which have not been implemented and which the Government has chosen to reject. One I want to reflect on today is the recommendation of the report which would have changed the arrangement on Norfolk Island so that it would have required Australian citizenship to be a voter in or a member of the Norfolk Island Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of obvious existing interests, our recommendation was that those who had already acquired the right of voting but did not currently have Australian citizenship would not have that stripped from them, but in future it would be a precondition of participation in Assembly elections on Norfolk Island that electors be Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this in context, there are approximately 2,000 residents of Norfolk Island on the island at the present time. Of those 2,000, approximately 1,500 are permanent residents under the very special arrangements that exist under the Norfolk Island legislation. Approximately 550 are temporary residents. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report summarises the population as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Island has a population of some 2,000 people&mdash;the majority of whom are permanent residents. Approximately 550 are temporary residents. Forty-six percent of the permanently resident population are of Pitcairn Island descent. Australians and New Zealanders make up the bulk of the balance of population. Tourism, the major economic activity of the island, attracts an estimated 26,000 tourists each year.</PARA>
<PARA>As well as those currently resident on the island, there are at least as many off the island entitled to residence on the island. Estimates of those numbers are difficult to be confident of, but it was suggested to us in discussions on the island that there may be as many as 3,000 people off Norfolk Island&mdash;that is, more than twice the current number presently residing as permanent residents&mdash;who are entitled to return to Norfolk Island should they so desire. In other words, they have the right of permanent residence but they currently reside outside Norfolk Island, principally in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking the population groups that have been mentioned, those who are of Pitcairn Island descent are automatically Australian citizens by virtue of their birth and their ancestry; those who are Australian living on the island are self-evidently Australian citizens; but there are about 500 or so permanent residents of the island who are neither Pitcairners by descent nor Australian citizens. Principally, those people are New Zealanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the laws relating to entitlement to participation in the Assembly elections allow for any person who has lived on the island for, I think, 3 1/2 years, and who evidences an intention to remain on the island permanently, to have the right to vote in that Assembly election. This means that approximately one-third of the effective franchise is held by non-Australian voters, principally New Zealanders. This is not part of any campaign of denigration of New Zealanders that may be part of a broader agenda for some; it simply reflects the reality of the social composition of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some others who are of non-Australian descent who are from the United States and other parts of the world. Indeed, one of the most prominent advocates of the extreme anti-Australian sentiment that was evidenced on some occasions is the editor of the local newsletter who is a citizen of the United States. So the comments I make are not directed in any way against New Zealanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is incompatible, in my view, with the developing constitutional framework that we have everywhere else in Australia to allow non-Australian citizens to participate in the election of government authorities. We have had to deal with very hard choices in other parts of Australia, in other Territories of Australia, where there are substantial populations of non-Australian citizens who reside in those Territories; they have the rights of permanent residents but they have chosen not to take out Australian citizenship. One example is Christmas Island&mdash;and I think the same applies to Cocos (Keeling) Islands&mdash;where many people have lived for a considerable period and, because they have property in some other country which they might forfeit title to if they take out Australian citizenship, or for reasons personal to themselves, they have chosen not to take out Australian citizenship and thereby forfeit the right to participate in the assembly elections in those Territories in which they reside. It is the same now throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a young lad growing up, it was sufficient for my parents to demonstrate that my father was a Scot; it was sufficient to demonstrate that he came from the British Empire, or from Britain, to entitle him to participate in a vote for the Federal Parliament. That changed some little while ago. More lately it changed in respect of local government elections. Before, all that was required was residency and now, of course, Australian citizenship is required as well. So there are common roles, and we now accept as a basic principle of democratic franchise right throughout this country that the rights and responsibilities of participating as an elector are conditional upon acceptance of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our report said, the consequence of that is a very narrow one. Had our report been accepted, the consequence would have been a very narrow one. That is because we recommended in respect of those who already exercise the right to vote be grandfathered that their franchise be maintained. We felt it would be improper for the Australian Parliament to take away a right that has been conferred already, and that those persons who have exercised a right to vote should lose that vote. We were not suggesting that. But we were saying that any new residents going to the island should not gain the right to participate in the Assembly elections unless they took out Australian citizenship. So people who come from New Zealand, the United States, or wherever, should they choose to settle in an Australian Territory, do not acquire a right to determine the policies of that Territory simply by reason of their residence; they acquire that right only by adopting Australia as their new home and taking out Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding my great pleasure in the very creditable, and I think skilled, negotiations that went on in relation to settling this question of ensuring that all Norfolk Island residents who are Australian citizens have the right to vote in Australian elections, I am still extremely disquieted by what seems to me to be an anomaly&mdash;something which is out of touch with the entire framework of our constitutional representation throughout the rest of this country, including in other Territories where similar difficulties emerge. It is now unique, and I think sadly unique, to Norfolk Island, where we still allow people to come in from other countries, to live on Norfolk Island for a relatively short period and to thereby acquire a right of participation in Assembly elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by indicating the distortions that are inherent in this kind of representation. In the course of our work it was put to us that our recommendations were entirely without the support of the Norfolk Island people. A referendum was held on 13 February 1991 to ask the electors of Norfolk Island the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to matters discussed by the Legal Regimes Inquiry, including the question of Federal representation, should the constitutional position of Norfolk Island be changed?</PARA>
<PARA>There is a great tradition throughout Australia of voting no in referendums. There was a great tradition established in Norfolk Island of voting no also. Some 82.3 per cent voted no and 16.9 per cent voted yes. If we exclude from those voters the 25 per cent who are citizens of other countries and who, therefore, would be offended by the recommendations we were putting&mdash;that is, that the enfranchisement of their fellows from overseas be no longer possible&mdash;we see that essentially there was a very mixed opinion. There would still be a substantial majority in favour of leaving things exactly as they were&mdash;a majority with whose opinions I would profoundly disagree&mdash;but it would be a very much smaller majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That 25 per cent of the island's population from New Zealand, the United States and other countries were able to vote in that referendum. Naturally, they voted in that referendum to support their existing interests. Their interests are often not necessarily those of the Nuffkas people who came to us privately and said that they felt that there were real concerns about their economic future, that they wanted to have a continuing sound relationship with Australia and that they were not persuaded by the kind of overheated rhetoric that was common to some of the propagandists for the anti-Australian cause. They felt that, whatever the future for Norfolk Island, it was in the interests of the people that it continue to have a healthy and sound relationship with the Australian mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by commending the Government for an elegant solution to a difficult problem, but also reminding it that in my view, whilst the Bill solves one problem, another problem remains yet to be addressed. </PARA>

There is no doubt that, given the nature and extent of feelings in Norfolk Island, it would be wrong to suggest that a measure such as this could have been introduced without significant consultation, and I want to refer to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, it seems to me that the legislation has really been a product of compromise. The circumstances of allowing the people of Norfolk Island a voice in the Australian Parliament has been achieved in a way which I think is both suitable from the point of view of us in Australia and satisfactory not just to the Pitcairners but to everybody on Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to canvass this matter as did my colleague on the external territories subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which produced the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr)&mdash;although there is one area which I want to pursue. I refer to the last point which the honourable member referred to, which he suggested we needed to look at further&mdash;the question of future Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that Norfolk Island is a very independent community. Happily for Australia and, I suspect, even more happily for the people of Norfolk Island, Norfolk Islanders have chosen to continue their association with Australia. I think we should start a discussion on an island of this nature by remembering that in Australia we believe that people should have the right to govern themselves. It is therefore very much a matter for the people of Norfolk Island to determine the extent to which they want to maintain their association with Australia. Of course, this legislation takes that association a step further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, the Pitcairners have felt somewhat different from other members of the island Territories of Australia&mdash;with understandable reasons. They trace their origins and situation from their transfer from Pitcairn Island. They have an entirely different right to their citizenship of Norfolk Island from other people. Indeed, one of the matters not addressed in the legislation, and which certainly generated some sympathy on my part, related to the fact that they would rather like on their Australian passports&mdash;they have no others&mdash;to be identified as coming from Norfolk Island. That might well generate difficulties, but as an individual I have considerable sympathy for the concept of Australian citizens who are residents of Norfolk Island being in some way identified as such on their passports. Frankly, I do not think that that would in any way prejudice their status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian citizenship is an issue which this Parliament needs to consider in a wider debate. I am not happy about the degree to which in my view it is not elevated to a debate on what I see as the most important of all the rights that we as individual Australians enjoy. I believe, therefore, that if we are going to create a separate status for residents of Norfolk Island we will in a way be reducing that status. That would concern me. So there are two sides of the debate as far as Norfolk Island is concerned. Certainly in my view, as far as Australians are concerned, being an Australian is a pre-eminent right and privilege. I do not want anything done that would in any way introduce different classes of Australian citizenship. I guess that is one of my reasons for questioning the degree to which we could give the residents of Norfolk Island that status on their passports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I do not know that we should impose Australian citizenship on Norfolk Island residents. It is appropriate to accept&mdash;and the honourable member for Denison has identified something of the population breakdown within Norfolk Island&mdash;that Norfolk Island is a Pacific Ocean domain. It is in a part of the South Pacific in which many other independent countries&mdash;some of which are even smaller than Norfolk Island&mdash;operate as independent nations. If Norfolk Islanders have decided to retain their association with us, so be it, but I do not believe that we should impose on them any obligation to Australian citizenship. Although I am a member of the committee which made those recommendations to which the honourable member for Denison referred, having heard the arguments of the people of Norfolk Island, I accept their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want in particular to speak of correspondence that I have received from Mr John Brown, the Minister for Health and Education in the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island, who, I understand, has recently been elected as the Chief Minister of the Legislative Assembly. I have had several concerns. I intend to quote from his letter to me. I understand that he has sent a copy to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), so I believe that it is not inappropriate that I read it into the record. Because of its relevance, I think it deserves wider understanding and, consequently, circulation. Without my having contacted Mr Brown, I trust that he will forgive my using his letter in this debate. The letter is dated 17 August 1992. I want to quote two parts of it. Firstly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . please be assured that the electoral Bill has the full support of the Norfolk Island Government and, I believe, community. As you may know, the Island's position on this issue followed an overwhelming vote in two local referendums against electoral integration with Canberra. Instead, after intensive negotiations with the Federal Government, a scheme was devised to allow Norfolk Island residents to vote in electorates with which they have affinity as individuals. I believe that this solution meets both Commonwealth and Island concerns about the involvement of Islanders in Federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph is perhaps even more significant. Mr Brown says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has been commented upon in detail by the Norfolk Island Government, and we have expressed our agreement with its terms. I think, therefore, that the Bill does indeed accommodate to the maximum the views of the people of Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is to be commended. I thank Mr Brown for having me advised of that. Part of my worry has been that, for all that there is this relationship with Australia, there was obviously a very strongly held opinion amongst Pitcairners, and I suspect others on Norfolk Island, about the degree to which they should retain that separate status. As the Minister's second reading speech identifies, Norfolk Islanders are, after all, now managing their own finances. As a result, to the maximum, we need to register the fact that they have a capacity to operate independently of us. Fortunately, through this compromise, they will be able to have a direct say in this place through those members who will represent them according to the way in which this legislation is structured. The Minister's second reading speech explains that in that it provides that those Norfolk Islanders who can establish a relevant connection with a State electoral subdivision can enrol in that subdivision; those who cannot establish such a connection may enrol in a particular Territory division, currently the division of Canberra. Therefore, there is an option for them to enrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the letter by Mr Brown&mdash;and I am particularly grateful to him for sending me this advice&mdash;related to a concern that I have canvassed in this place before. My worry was that, whereas under our Constitution there is a requirement that we do not hold two offices of profit under the Crown, that apparently was not the practice in Norfolk Island. I have spoken of the unique character of Norfolk Island. I think it is quite appropriate, therefore, that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly is developing its own answer to this problem. I would prefer it to be done in that way rather than having it imposed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Mr Brown for having advised me of this prior to this debate. I shall quote from his letter to identify the arrangement. My point, as some honourable members may recall, was not that I wanted to preclude any resident of Norfolk Island being eligible to vote or standing for office. My concern was rather that such a person, already having one office, should not be in a position of conflict. Apparently, some were employees of the body that was their employer and of which they, as elected members of the Legislative Assembly, had a different responsibility to the people of Norfolk Island. I can see a conflict between their elected position and their official responsibilities as paid employees of the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to hear that under section 43, to which I will refer, of a draft of the Norfolk Island Government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter of Aims, Goals and Objectives</EMPHASIS> there is consideration of a specific amendment which will preclude this in future. I refer to that, if I may, by quoting from the letter from Minister John Brown:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of public servants' ability to be members of the Legislative Assembly is, of course, a separate issue, and the Norfolk Island Government is very keen to ensure that the issue does not delay the progress of the electoral Bill in the form in which it was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, you may be interested to know that, following the general election here in May of this year, I, as Minister responsible for public service matters, have placed before the Legislative Assembly a proposal on page 4 of the enclosed paper entitled "The Norfolk Island Public Sector&mdash;Proposals for Change", and also at clause 43 of the draft Bill included in the paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While no decisions have yet been made on this proposal, it is certainly under consideration. It would, therefore, be fair to say that the problem raised in your speech&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the problem about a conflict of interest that I raised in my speech&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is under review by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend Mr Brown for that, and I trust that the proposals are adopted. I believe that it would be very much in the interests of the community of Norfolk Island to adopt that principle which avoids any suggestion of a person in any way having a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from the document titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Norfolk Island Public Sector&mdash;Proposals for Change</EMPHASIS>. Under the title `Assembly members' on page 4, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper proposes that the ability of Assembly members to retain employment in the public sector be removed after a transitional period. However, regulations may be made exempting certain classes of public sector employees from this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>If one turns to the draft legislation, which the Minister has also forwarded to me, the heading of clause 43 reads `Certain Legislative Assembly members not to be employees'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43.(1) Subject to subsection (3), a public sector employee who&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) is elected after the commencement of this section  to be a member of the Legislative Assembly&mdash;is to be taken to have resigned from the person's employment under section 42 with effect from the date of the election; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) on the commencement of this section holds office as a member of the Legislative Assembly&mdash;is to be taken to have resigned from the person's employment under section 42 with effect from the end of the period of 3 months beginning on the commencement, unless the person has, before the end of that period, ceased to be a member of the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 43 continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2). . . a person who is a member of the Legislative Assembly must not, after the end of the period of 3 months beginning on the commencement of this section, be employed under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to public sector employees included in a prescribed class of such employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) If a person elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly is, on the date of the person's election, a public sector employee included in a class prescribed under subsection (3), the subsequent amendment or repeal of the regulations does not apply to the person until the date of the next succeeding general election.</PARA>
<PARA>Provided those are put into place, I think it will go a long way to meeting the problem. Indeed, it is a challenge for the Legislative Assembly. I know the difficulties of a small community. What I have said on earlier occasions does not reflect against any individual. One individual inevitably was in this position and, hence, that was the reason for my raising the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this does not go as far as the Australian constitutional requirement. That really is not so much at issue. I think it is more a matter of the people of Norfolk Island being quite confident that, if they elect a member to the Legislative Assembly, that person is able to act in a totally dispassionate way without any prejudice on his or her behalf. In other words, I do not believe that being an employee and a member of the Legislative Assembly is irreconcilable. It was on that basis that I felt it necessary that a revision be made. Even though I understand that it is the responsibility of the Legislative Assembly and I feel that perhaps this does not go as far as I would prefer, I still accept that it is ultimately for the Assembly to decide. I think it is important that we understand that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly is considering the problem along with other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Mr Brown for setting down this Norfolk Island<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Charter of Aims, Goals and Objectives</EMPHASIS>. As he said, it is to preserve and foster the cultural integrity and environmental quality of Norfolk Island, which I think every honourable member would endorse. There has been significant progress towards ensuring that there is not a conflict of interest. The fact that perhaps it does not go as far as I would wish is really for the Norfolk Islanders ultimately to determine. I am glad to see that there has been progress, and I commend Mr Brown for letting me know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this legislation is that it has been reached by compromise between the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the Australian Government. I think that is essential. </PARA>

However, I notice that the travelling allowance that is henceforth to be paid to the Federal Court judges who travel there as judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court is being regularised.

I endorse the fact that they have been paid in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in speaking on the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill. The Bill is in essence quite simple; it amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to implement the recommendation of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> which canvassed the legal regimes of Australia's various external Territories. Essentially, what the Committee recommended, which is incorporated in this Bill, is that Australians resident on Norfolk Island should be given the opportunity to vote in a Federal election. This therefore puts Norfolk Island on the same footing as the other Australian external Territories, notably Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and puts its residents on the same footing as all Australians in having the right to vote. The situation was one that the Australian Parliament could not tolerate in that a group of Australians&mdash;albeit a small group; I think the permanent population of Norfolk Island is about 2,000&mdash;was unable to vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this is a simple measure, its path in getting here has not been terribly simple. There have been two issues, the first of which was the question of whether the residents of Norfolk Island should have this right conferred upon them. There was certainly a strong feeling among people on the island that they did not want this favour, that they did not want to vote. Secondly, there was a constitutional issue as to the mechanism by which the scheme would be put into place. That has been the subject of a period of detailed consultation between the Government and the Government of Norfolk Island. In addition, a number of legal opinions, which I have had the opportunity to peruse, have been prepared by quite eminent Australian lawyers on this question of whether the scheme incorporated in the Bill is constitutional. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) indicated, there may be some debate on the point, and I will canvass it briefly in a few minutes; but I do not suppose that it will ever really come to be determined because, if the Parliament and Norfolk Island are happy about it, one wonders whether anyone would ever take it to the High Court for a final determination. It is in a sense, I suppose, a moot point, but an interesting point nonetheless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have indicated, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee visited Norfolk Island on, I think, two occasions&mdash;I was able to go on the second of those occasions&mdash;to speak to the residents of the island and particularly to the Government of Norfolk Island. It was an extremely enjoyable experience, and I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) that the island can be described as a paradise. Nonetheless, the reception that the Committee members received was not one that one would normally expect from the inhabitants of a paradise; I think it is fair to say that there was a feeling of suspicion, and maybe a degree of cynicism, towards the Committee, and more broadly towards the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norfolk Island is unique; there is no question about that. It is, I suppose, an accident of history more than anything else that the island forms part of the Australian Territories. When the island was discovered by Cook in 1774 it was uninhabited. It was not until a prison colony was incorporated on the island in 1825 that there was permanent occupation of the island. That occupation continued for 30 years and then the first permanent&mdash;in the true sense&mdash;population arrived in 1856 with the relocation of the descendants of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bounty</EMPHASIS> who had found themselves on Pitcairn Island and who were offered, and accepted the offer, to move from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that point in 1856 until today, I think it is fair to say that there has remained a very strong feeling amongst those descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders that they really have no direct connection with Australia; it was only through the British Government at the time, the British Crown, placing the administration of Norfolk Island in, firstly, Van Diemen's Land, then the colony of New South Wales and finally, with Federation, Australia that they have a connection with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I have some sympathy with that view; I can understand why people feel that way. But I do not know whether those feelings in the sense of independence are related purely to the historical significance and history of Norfolk Island. Slightly less than 50 per cent of the population are the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders; the other 50 per cent are made up roughly in proportion of half from the Australian mainland and half from places abroad, significantly New Zealand but a whole range of countries, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norfolk Island is quite an affluent place; it rates quite high in a table of millionaires per head of population. There are a number of very affluent people on the island. One of the major concerns with what the Committee was doing was the sort of converse of the great catchcry of the American Revolution, which was no taxation without representation. The Norfolk Islanders tended to fear that if they got representation taxation would follow. At the time, we tried to stress to the Islanders that that was not at any stage the intention of the Committee or of any individual Committee members; we were quite satisfied, broadly speaking at least, with the level of self-government that had been attained on the island. The whole thrust of the Committee's inquiries, not only in Norfolk Island but in the other Territories, was to support the concept of self-government, to allow self-determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norfolk Island, unlike the other island Territories, does have a relatively strong economic base; it can survive, to a certain extent if not a large extent, on its own two feet. It receives well in excess of 25,000 tourists per year; tourism would be the core of its economy. It is a relatively buoyant economy and it has a great deal of self-determination and a high degree of self-government. It has its own tax systems and does not rely on the Australian social security system. There is a range of basic pieces of legislation that are run purely from the island's own government and from its own resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is still a bit of a misconception on the island as to the amount of assistance that it receives from the Australian Government. There is a somewhat jaundiced view amongst at least some islanders, and to an extent the Norfolk Island Government, that it is really completely freestanding from Australia and does not need Australia. I do not think that is an entirely valid view; certainly a whole range of services is still provided from Australia. One of the Committee's recommendations encouraged the process of cost recovery to continue. That is in both our interests and the interests of the Norfolk Island Government, which I think would support this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three basic things for which the island is reliant on Australia. The first is defence, and it is obviously also in Australia's interests to continue our relationship with Norfolk Island. The economy of Norfolk Island is quite strong, but to an extent that is also very much bolstered by Australia. For instance, if someone in one of the tourist facilities on the island were to lose a job, I am sure that person would end up here looking for work. The employment opportunities on the island are not as great as we would like or as those on the island would like. If a person were to be made unemployed, I am not saying that the person would  be encouraged to leave or anything like that, but there is a social security system in place here and I think there would be a tendency to move away from the island back to Australia or perhaps to New Zealand. That is a factor that is often not given due recognition by the island Government in its claims that it is able to stand on its own two feet. Largely speaking, I think it can do so. I think it should be encouraged to do so and Australia should be pulling back in terms of its administration on the island. We should be safeguarding our own interests but at the same time encouraging the process of self-government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While this Parliament is empowered to make laws which affect Norfolk Island, Islanders have the fundamental right, I believe, to vote to determine the representatives in this chamber; that is what motivated the Committee. It was not some sort of backdoor attempt to get taxation or to change the island way of life. We are not interested in doing that. We are interested in enhancing the island way of life. We think basic rights should be common to all Australians, whether those Australians live on Norfolk Island or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That then brings me to the second matter. Having agreed upon the basic premise that the right to vote should be extended, the debate then turned to how that should be put into place. The Committee did not take a great deal of advice on this point, but the advice that it had at that stage was that it would be necessary for the island to be incorporated into one of the Territory electorates on the Australian mainland. We have, for instance, territorians on Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island voting in the Federal electorate of the Northern Territory. At that stage, on the basis of the advice the Committee had as to the constitutional choices available to it, it seemed to it logical that the island would have to be attached to one of the two ACT electorates and, at least in the early stages, it was determined that Canberra would be the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This caused great consternation amongst the Islanders. They believed they had no community of interest with Canberra, and I would not pretend they had. Obviously they would have no particular community of interest with any particular one Australian Federal electorate, and I accept that. They devised this scheme where, if an individual elector could establish a connection with a particular Australian Federal electorate, then that elector should be entitled to seek enrolment in that particular electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial advice from the Attorney-General's Department was that that scheme was not going to be constitutional. At that stage the Islanders sought opinions. The first advice was obtained from Mr Bob Ellicott, who would be well known to honourable members in this House. He advised that the advice of the Attorney-General's Department was not correct, that the same sorts of provisions which allowed itinerant voting under the Commonwealth Electoral Act could allow a similar sort of scheme to apply for Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second advice was then obtained from Professor Leslie Zines, who would be well known to students of constitutional law in Australia. He is, I think, well known and is well regarded in terms of his expertise in the area of the Australian Constitution. He gave an opinion also that the scheme finally incorporated in this legislation was constitutional. Certainly there was some dispute about that to some degree amongst officers within the Attorney-General's Department and I have seen opinions written by the Chief General Counsel from the Attorney-General's Department, Dennis Rose, QC, who was doubtful whether the scheme first proposed by the Island Government would have allowed all island residents who may have wished to seek enrolment the opportunity to do so. But in the end it has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the Bill, one sees that if a voter cannot establish a connection with any particular mainland electorate through having previously lived there, been enrolled there or having next of kin there, then he can enrol in the division of Canberra. That covers the entire field. Under the existing provisions applying to itinerant electors, some people can attach themselves to a particular electorate. A Pitcairn Islander who was born on the island and who had never had any particular link with mainland Australia would be unable to do that, but if he wished to exercise a right to vote in an Australian Federal electorate I think he would probably end up having to enrol in the division of Canberra under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result is that any person on the island who wants to vote will be given now the right to do so in a particular electorate or within the electorate of Canberra. I take particular note of the advice of Professor Zines who, I thought, prepared a very thoughtful opinion on it. I certainly am not going to hold myself up as a person to argue the toss with such an eminent Australian academic lawyer. But, given that I doubt it will come before the High Court anyway, and everyone involved in the scheme is happy with it, so be it: I think it is a good outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I hope that the whole process has been a fruitful one. I think it has shown a reasonable level of maturity both on behalf of the Norfolk Island Government and also the Minister and the Australian Government to be able to negotiate these things through and come to a suitable solution to a difficult question. In the end I think it is a good result for the Islanders in that it recognises their particular circumstances. It also is a good result for the Australian Parliament in that we have maintained our legitimate interest in making sure that the right to vote is extended but in a way which the Norfolk Island Government can live with. It is a very worthwhile Bill and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will be pleased to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I now intend to turn to the Bill. I will stay within the Standing Orders so that you do not have to exercise some kind of discipline over me before the major event that is supposed to occur tonight. This Bill transfers the management of marine reptiles and mammals from fisheries to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. I say at the beginning that the Opposition is pleased to support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sea snakes, seals and birds of the sea are already protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations. Turtles, crocodiles and dugong will soon be added to that list and whales and dolphins are already protected under the Whale Protection Act 1980 by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Thus under these measures all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth waters under legislation administered by one body, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Much of the enforcement of these regulations is delegated to State fisheries or conservation agencies. We note that the powers of enforcement are consistent with those applying under the Whale Protection Act and there is the same level of stringency in this protection as under the old Fisheries Act which was used to protect these species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference to the Whale Protection Act leads me to remind the House that this was one of the many significant environmental advances made by the Fraser coalition Government, of which I was a member. I say to those who might have noted that I have taken a very strong interest in economic affairs over the last few years, because of the circumstances that have faced Australia, that I would like all those interested in this portfolio to know that I was a very strong supporter of the environmental measures taken by the Fraser Government. I think all those who were connected with them can be proud of their achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a very longstanding interest in environmental issues concerning not only the natural environment but also the man-made environment. Those bodies and groups that wish to put forward proposals within this area will certainly find an open door with me. Like my predecessor, the honourable member for Pearce, I will be absolutely straight with all parties&mdash;that is, whether they be developers, miners, conservation foundations or any of the various groups with a legitimate interest in development and environment, they will all get the same message from me. They will not get selective messages at different times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the Whale Protection Act, from which the actual policing arrangements are drawn for this measure, I remind honourable members of the introduction on 23 April 1980 by my then colleague the Hon. David Thomson, Minister for Science and the Environment, of the Whale Protection Bill 1980. I quote from his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Fraser Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">commissioned an independent inquiry into whales and whaling headed by Sir Sydney Frost. The report of the inquiry was tabled in Parliament on 20 February 1979. On 4 April 1979, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that the Government had accepted all recommendations made in that report. The central conclusion accepted by the Government was that the Whaling Act 1960 be repealed and that we pursue a vigorous and active policy for the protection of whales. This Bill introduces such a policy for all cetaceans, that is, whales, porpoises and dolphins.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a matter of some amusement in the party room at that time, as I recall, because there were some members who did not know what a cetacean was. They thought it was something pinned on a jacket, but there were some of us who had been to school and knew about those things from way back. I quote again from Mr Thomson's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill prohibits the killing, capturing, injuring or interference with cetaceans in the 200-mile Australian fishing zone and by Australians domiciled in Australia and Australian vessels and aircraft and their crews beyond the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, with penalties up to $100,000. Support for a total worldwide ban on whaling will be sought through international forums, such as the International Whaling Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been quite interesting in recent weeks to see a resurgence in some quarters of attempts to begin whaling again. It is interesting to remember the struggles that went on at that time, which were successful, and the very strong actions taken by the Fraser Government for the protection of whales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection of these other species of the sea fits into that category. The enforcement mechanisms that were put in place by Mr Thomson at that time, using the National Parks and Wildlife Service as the protective instrument, have been adopted for this measure. So it is with particular pleasure that on behalf of the Opposition I give my full support to this Bill. </PARA>

I too would like to thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) for his contribution because I always thought that he added considerably to debate in the place, although I am sure that the new shadow Minister will also add considerably to a most important area of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the Opposition for supporting the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992. It is a simple amendment mainly to ensure that marine reptiles, birds and mammals will now be protected under a new Act. The Government found, after the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) had discussed the matter, that it was not sensible for the management of mammals and marine reptiles to be controlled under commercial fisheries legislation and that responsibility for those animals should be transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Of course, the range of offences and penalties and so on are set out in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main purposes of the amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act is to extend the application of the existing powers to the waters of the continental shelf and the Australian fishing zone. I thought I might spend a little bit of time on a matter that really arises from this because we can have specific legislation which seeks to protect valuable and perhaps endangered species but we are finding that one of the greatest threats to these sorts of species is, in fact, introduced species such as feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of concentration on the eradication of feral animals. The Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> featured an action in which the Army partook recently in the Diamantina River in far western Queensland where the State Minister for conservation, Pat Comben, had arranged with his officers and the Army to undertake the eradication of some feral cats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be worth showing some of the illustrations of how we need to tackle the problem of the eradication of introduced species. They have become a direct threat to native species of animals because they may be predators of those animals, or they may ruin the habitation of the local environment and indirectly threaten the native species, not to mention their threat to native plant species when they dig them up or root them out. There are some quite extraordinary numbers. I will run through some of the species of animals that are of concern to us and are being destroyed under Commonwealth programs and in conjunction with State programs. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 13 August this year, Brian Williams, a journalist who travelled to the Diamantina River, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Army sharpshooters have killed 420 feral cats in just three days in Queensland's far west.</PARA>
<PARA>He reported that they are undertaking this activity on the open Mitchell grass plains along the Diamantina River. He said that this was done in conjunction with Queensland National Parks and Wildlife researchers who themselves were out shooting cats. I would not have thought that what we think of as the domestic cat could possibly survive in that sort of environment, but some of the cats have been weighed by National Parks officers at over eight kilograms. They are certainly doing very nicely out of either attacking and devouring native species or at least denying those native species other sources of food. As I said, that Army exercise was done in conjunction with the departmental staff of the State environment Minister, Pat Comben. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there was this coincidence of a rat plague. The cats had built up their numbers on the backs, almost literally, of the rat plague. The concern now is that, as the rat numbers are weakened and they are destroyed through drought in the western districts, the cats will turn their attention more directly to the native species. This article lists some of the species that will be further threatened by feral cats: the bilby; the kowari, which is a marsupial mouse; the plains wanderer, which is a grasslands bird; and possibly the yellow chat, which is a small ground-feeding bird. These feral cats are known to hunt each of those animals. That is of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further interesting statistic quoted here is that people from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service have indicated in their research that one domestic cat left uncontrolled might kill an average of 25 animals each year. Let loose, the humble cat gone feral can have a very widespread and devastating impact on any number of endangered species. It is important that the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, improve, as it has in the last few years and will continue to do, its intervention in this area such that we can kill off some of these animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I looked at a report by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory, where different species of introduced animals are having a very large and devastating impact. This report of June 1991 referred to a number of Commonwealth programs which were aimed at eradicating some of the larger feral animals in this area, mainly water buffalo and pigs. I will refer to some advances in this area as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report includes an example of control taking place in Kakadu National Park through the Commonwealth brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. Through that campaign, the Commonwealth has funded the removal of approximately 100,000 buffalo and cattle from Kakadu National Park since 1979 and about four and a half thousand in the last year. We have now reached a point at which the density of these beasts is about one beast per 100 square kilometres. We are approaching a point at which it is not so much hard to find them; rather, we are receiving diminished returns to scale for our effort. We have got through these animals in very large numbers. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are suggesting that there are now very low buffalo numbers in Kakadu National Park&mdash;around about 500 to 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a considerable reduction of those introduced species. The report also mentions feral pigs, to which I have a couple of references. There have also been some great gains. The major infestations of feral pigs have been greatly reduced. I understand there is no separate strategy for the control of pigs unless there have been infestations detected in areas of high public use or where there is good access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be very careful about the methods we use to cull these animals. Recently I read a report which said that we might set traps for, or poison, feral pigs just out of Canberra, where there is quite a large pig population. That works well there, but in the Northern Territory&mdash;certainly in the Kakadu region&mdash;we have to be extremely careful because the Aboriginal population hunts feral pigs as a source of protein. We simply cannot be using poisons as a means of eradicating those animals. We have to be selective about the means of destroying them. The buffalo and the feral pig are probably the major destroyers of land, certainly in the northern areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, which reported in June last year, gives us an indication of this destruction. The report contains a quote by an officer of the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries who evaluated the environmental threat in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Buffalo and pigs are the most environmentally dangerous. Pigs probably will have to rate above buffaloes now and this is likely to be the case for the next 10 to 15 years. In central Australia, rabbits are the most dangerous, followed by horses. It would be fair to say that rabbits would be far and away the biggest problem. . . Foxes are also significant.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been considerable debate over Fraser Island, which is in my neck of the woods, up from Brisbane, where a very small number of brumbies have been running wild for some years. Inevitably debate pops onto the TV screens from time to time whereby animal welfare rightists want to save those brumbies. But those brumbies can be very destructive to growth around fairly unstable sand-dunes. If they are not destroyed, there will be some destruction on the sand-dunes. We have to make choices. I would find the choice fairly easy. We would have to destroy the brumbies in this instance. I would not like to be the one to have to do it. I am a bit squeamish when it comes to the destruction of any life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which animals can destroy habitat is also worth looking at. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service gave evidence to the Senate Committee that the water buffalo, in particular, presented an unacceptable environmental threat in Kakadu National Park. It described the potential of the impact as devastating. The Service then listed the environmental impacts of the buffalo. It is worth while using this illustration. They included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.vegetation damage through grazing and trampling;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">soil compaction;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.saltwater intrusion into low-lying freshwater swamps through breaching of natural levee banks by swim channels;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">siltation and pollution of water bodies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">noxious weed dispersal; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.impact on other animals through modification of habitat.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the ways in which these animals are destroying habitat. The number of threatened native species in this area is very significant and this presents us with manpower and funding problems. We have to have sufficient programs, sufficient people and the right means of destroying these animals before they have such an impact on this area that we may in fact lose for all time certain species of animals that are reliant on the same environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article from the Northern Territory Conservation Commission which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS> of 20 June this year indicated that `Wild pigs first came to notice in the Territory in 1827'. So these animals have been with us for a considerable time and, as far as we can tell, their numbers have not been threatened until the last few years when officers have informed governments of their enormous impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many animals of the Australian arid and semi-arid zone in the north are threatened by these larger animals. These include: the inland western quoll, the long tailed dunnart, the numbat, the western barred bandicoot, the banded hare-wallaby, the pebble-mound mouse, the sandhill dunnart and so on. As far as I am aware, each of those animals is a very small and fragile animal which can be destroyed very easily by larger animals. They will certainly be affected in as great a number as there is by any destruction of their habitats, and these native animals are subject to destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then turn to the debate that we often have across the chamber&mdash;perhaps more with National Party members&mdash;as to whether a government ought to declare wilderness areas where, if unchecked, feral animals can run amuck. The farmers may say, `Look, isn't it better that farmers might be able to assist in the destruction of feral animals by running cattle or whatever into an area?'. There is also a debate about competition for food between cattle and sheep and feral and native animals. We have had that debate in this chamber from time to time. But the officers of the Northern Territory Government made an interesting point about the question of how many animals were being stocked in an area. Mr Davis of the Northern Territory Government&mdash;I do not know which department&mdash;explained the point and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, there are properties that are running large numbers of ferals and trying to ignore the fact that there are those numbers of ferals. They are saying, `This property can run 40,000 head of cattle', and they are running 40,000 head of cattle when in fact the total stocking [with feral cattle or cattle equivalents] is probably 120,000.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to look at the impact of all the animals grazing and living in a particular area. We might be looking at the true impact of the domestically husbanded animals which are being carried on an area&mdash;in this case, 40,000 head of cattle&mdash;but they are in addition to other animals which are being carried there, both native and feral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the sensitivities about who is best placed to keep feral numbers low. By and large, we have worked very closely with the National Farmers Federation, as have the conservation groups. This will not come as a surprise to the honourable member for Mackellar because he will know of the considerable liaison and discussion that have gone on between the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation on all of these sorts of issues. A lot of joint work is going on which will satisfy the aims of both groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They seem to me to be some of the critical issues when it comes to making sure that we save native species. Although this debate started out on the question of reptiles, birds and mammals, I have chosen to concentrate on the question of land animals: feral pigs, cats and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Budget has three fundamental objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The first two are about jobs: jobs now, and more jobs in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>When, as is the situation now, there are not enough jobs, it is up to the Government to take action; to do everything in its power to provide jobs for those Australians without work. </PARA>
<PARA>We have already taken initiatives to boost the economy and rebuild and modernise the nation's transport system. </PARA>
<PARA>We have vastly expanded opportunities for young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>And tonight, as our first priority, I announce further measures to boost employment in those communities and regions hardest hit in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of our fellow Australians have, for the first time, found themselves out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>For them we cannot simply wait and hope, or engage in some economic experiment. </PARA>
<PARA>We must act now, and act in ways which we know will work. </PARA>
<PARA>These employment measures will include projects conceived at the local level, providing real work and, at the same time, enhancing facilities for many deprived communities. </PARA>
<PARA>The total cost will be $1.2 billion over two years.</PARA>
<PARA>This attack on unemployment is part of our second objective&mdash;the implementation of a comprehensive and continuing strategy which is designed to achieve around 800,000 new jobs over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Crucial to this strategy is the maintenance of a resolve to create a dynamic and successful trading nation: a nation based on talent, ideas and innovation, with its industry employing skilled workers producing goods and services to sell here and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>This resolve will be fortified by measures announced tonight to entrench an already impressive growth in research and development and in exports. </PARA>
<PARA>There are new initiatives in vocational training, and there is increased effort to cut the costs of Government services and to improve competition. </PARA>
<PARA>Our objective is to have new industries alongside the old, striving to secure a larger slice of the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>But this Budget&mdash;as its third objective&mdash;also confirms this Government as a caring Government, intent on pursuing its program of social reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I announce a major enhancement of Medicare, increased support for the aged and for those who care for them, and increased support for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are new measures to improve access to more secure housing, and there is more assistance for families. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">AUSTRALIA IN THE WORLD              ECONOMY</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, as a small nation our future depends on taking advantage of developments abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>And in our case we straddle two very different parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>First there is the industrialised world of Europe and North America. These countries have also been struggling with high levels of unemployment. But they have higher inflation than we have. And many have lower growth prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's inflation rate is around 2 per cent, about half that of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>This year the Government expects the Australian economy to grow by 3 per cent, or around a third faster than Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is also part of Asia. Growth rates and productivity in many Asian countries are impressive. But some have inflation close to 10 per cent. Most have inflation more than double that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>With a foot in each hemisphere we can benefit from opportunities in both. </PARA>
<PARA>We can enjoy higher growth than is forecast for Europe and the USA, with inflation certainly no higher. </PARA>
<PARA>Our growth rate will be closer to Asia's, but it will come without Asia's higher inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>And as we commit ourselves to best practice at home, and embrace competition abroad, neither hemisphere will constrain our growth. </PARA>
<PARA>But these opportunities will not be handed to us on a plate. </PARA>
<PARA>We must seize them. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ADDRESSING THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Last year was difficult for many countries. It was particularly difficult for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Recovery started during the year, but failed to gather strength in the way expected. </PARA>
<PARA>We all deeply regret that the growth achieved was not sufficient to prevent rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>We all deeply regret the cost of unemployment to individuals, to families and to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>But regret, without action, has a very hollow ring to it. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly 50 years ago, the Labor Government of John Curtin, in its famous White Paper, committed the Commonwealth to a policy of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government affirms that full employment must and will be our continuing goal. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I present a statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working for the Future</EMPHASIS> which sets out this Government's plans for the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Budgetary Stimulus</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has a firm and unequivocal role to play in  boosting economic activity in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>It does so by providing a strong but temporary stimulus, and by ensuring that Australia emerges into sustained growth, with an enhanced economic infrastructure, better able to underpin the opportunities of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, the outlays cost of new and previously announced measures to boost the economy will be around $4 1/2 billion in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, we will allow the impact of the recession on the Budget to run its course. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, the Budget deficit in 1992-93 is estimated to be $13.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly 10 years ago this Government acted in the 1983 Budget to boost the economy and to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>One and a half million new jobs were created and within four years the Budget recorded a surplus&mdash;the first in nearly four decades. </PARA>
<PARA>The present recovery will deliver jobs. But the Government is acting now to reduce unemployment more quickly, to ease the pain and burden on Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employment Package</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I announce the expenditure of a further $742m this year, and another $467m next year, to attack unemployment at its roots&mdash;in the communities where the despair is deepest and where the pain hurts most. </PARA>
<PARA>The package builds on the offer from local government&mdash;the sphere of government closest to the community&mdash;to move rapidly to expand local employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This package for local government involves job placement, road building and repair, and a new local capital works program, together with the Landcare projects recently announced. </PARA>
<PARA>Its centrepiece will be the local capital works program which will inject $345m into 411 local government councils, where about 70 per cent of all unemployed people live. </PARA>
<PARA>The program will involve grants of between $4m and $20m for each of 23 regions hardest hit by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be $60m for roads, and $154m to be spent on government and non-government schools and universities. </PARA>
<PARA>$188m planned for expenditure on urban development and public housing will be brought forward and spent this year and next. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditures on Defence purchases and on Defence housing of $87m will similarly be advanced to this year. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will also be focused in regions with high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Labour market and training programs will be expanded, particularly to assist long-term unemployed adults and to improve workforce skills and labour market flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA>.Places under the JOBSTART program this year will almost double, to 104,000. </PARA>
<PARA>.Work experience and training under the JOBSKILLS program will be available for an additional 12,000 people over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>.An extra $92m will be provided over three years for adult training places to help people back into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>.Over the next four years, we will provide English language training to 38,000 job seekers. </PARA>
<PARA>In all, we will nearly double expenditure on these programs this year, to $1.1 billion, and we will assist over 420,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA>The combined effects of these measures will see unemployment decline from 11 per cent last June to below 10 per cent 12 months from now, and keep on declining in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">MAINTAINING AND ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC TRANSITION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, reducing unemployment is our most pressing objective. </PARA>
<PARA>But we must also continue our confident resolve to build a more export-oriented nation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy is part way through a momentous period of transition. </PARA>
<PARA>We have derived enormous benefits from our abundant natural resources and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>But in a highly competitive world, we must increasingly turn to the even more potent talents of our people. </PARA>
<PARA>We are creating new strengths and new skills as we respond to changes in the world around us. </PARA>
<PARA>In five years, our manufactured exports have more than doubled, while exports of services have increased by 82 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been an outstanding achievement. Our record on manufactured exports surpasses that of the major developed countries and even the Asian tigers. </PARA>
<PARA>But we need to increase our total share of the world market, if our growth is not to be constrained by the subdued international outlook. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget adds to new measures announced in February, to enhance the capacity of our industries to export. </PARA>
<PARA>$75m will be provided over three years from 1993-94 to those established and successful exporters entering new markets. </PARA>
<PARA>And a new working capital guarantee facility will support approximately $300m of new exports for firms short of working capital. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also to assist further the rural sector which has been badly affected by reduced world prices and severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA>We are reducing the costs facing all exporters&mdash;our farmers, our miners, our manufacturers. And we are working with the States to improve the interstate rail freight and electricity industries. </PARA>
<PARA>With the States, we are reviewing their vital water supply industry and their shipping ports, and there is more to come. </PARA>
<PARA>We have given the Industry Commission a new role to identify impediments restricting the growth of promising export industries. I am announcing the first group of 10 references tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the capacity of our industries to compete depends on our ability to develop innovative products and more efficient production methods. </PARA>
<PARA>We have decided to extend indefinitely the 150 per cent  research and development tax concession, so that Australia can continue to grow as one of the world's research and development centres. We have also decided to tighten up the scheme to ensure that research benefiting from tax concessions has an appropriate commercial focus. </PARA>
<PARA>And our great scientific institutions, such as CSIRO, will receive $31m over two years to continue building the research capacity so necessary for the challenge ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Innovation springs from the arts as well as science. The Budget continues support of the film industry and increases support to the performing arts. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Economic Growth and the Environment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>While the Government is actively encouraging the development of industry, this will be consistent with the preservation of the Australian and global environment. </PARA>
<PARA>We are allocating $107m over the next four years to industry and environment programs to foster sustainable development and to help address climate change issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's initiatives will integrate economic and environmental decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA>We will improve the taxation treatment of investment for, and spending on, pollution control. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Training and Workforce Skills</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Our capacity to compete in the world, and to enjoy challenging jobs, depends greatly on the skills of our workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>The creation of a new Australian National Training Authority and the injection of $720m by the Commonwealth will see, in three years, over 100,000 more young Australians involved in vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA>And by the year 2000, we will have another 200,000 young Australians aged between 15 and 19 years at school, in college and at university. </PARA>
<PARA>To meet these increasing demands, the employment package I am announcing includes $60m to help the States refurbish up to 600 of their older high schools. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Education</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In higher education, the Government will establish the Open Learning Program at a cost of $53m over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA>For Australians in remote communities, for those with family or work commitments, and indeed for any Australian who may not have enjoyed access to traditional higher education, this initiative will be a historic milestone in removing barriers to participation. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have access to a university education. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing AUSTUDY arrangements will be improved, and the system of grants will remain intact. </PARA>
<PARA>Tertiary AUSTUDY students will have the option to supplement their benefits through a voluntary loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Through all the improvements to AUSTUDY, about 43,000 additional students will be eligible for AUSTUDY assistance. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Wages Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the co-operative development of a flexible wages policy is a key element in this Government's economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>Through its close relationship with the trade union movement, this Government has fundamentally altered Australia's wage setting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Workplace bargaining, which links wage increases to skills formation and productivity improvement, will become the primary mechanism for wage adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA>Agreements between managers and workers on matters such as hours of work, penalty rates, work practices and wage rates have improved flexibility while maintaining basic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Building on this approach, the Government has proposed an  alternative to a National Wage Case. </PARA>
<PARA>Our proposal is that minimum award rates be adjusted through supplementary payments, by an amount of $10 a week, and that workplace bargaining be the principal vehicle for wage increases in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>This will protect low paid workers while encouraging employers and employees to accelerate productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA>This will occur in a framework of maintaining Australia's inflation rate at or below that of our major trading partners and matching international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1990s, as in the 1980s, the Accord between the Government and the trade union movement will ensure that we achieve significant improvements in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SOCIAL REFORM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>This Budget is a budget of action on jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a budget of confident resolve to continue the transition to a modern, vibrant economy. </PARA>
<PARA>But it remains a budget of care; care for the aged, care for the frail, and care for the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Budget the Government is building on its proud record of social reform. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Medicare</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Important among the changes are the Medicare reforms which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) will announce tonight. They will guarantee that every Australian will have access to the full range of hospital and medical services on a fair basis. </PARA>
<PARA>An additional $1.6 billion will be provided over six years for public hospitals, subject to the States and Territories agreeing to the Government's proposals for the strengthening of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>These proposals ensure that Australians will have hospital services provided on the basis of clinical need and not on the basis of private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA>No longer will private patients be able to jump the queue ahead of public patients in equal need of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>A program, costing $71m over two years, will ensure that waiting times for elective surgery are brought down to acceptable levels. Strategies to achieve this will include, where necessary, buying in services from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reforms will ensure that Medicare can meet the 29 per cent increase in public hospital admissions expected over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>To fund these substantial improvements in health services, the Medicare levy will increase by 0.15 per cent from 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians on average weekly earnings will pay about 80 cents extra a week in their Medicare levy. For this they will receive the benefits of&mdash;and improvements to&mdash;one of the best health care services in the world. This achievement is one of which this Government and indeed all Australians can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Support for Pensioners and Allowees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Government gave a commitment to provide a real increase in pensions during the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am now announcing an increase in the single rate of pension of $6 a fortnight, and $10 a fortnight for pensioner couples, from late January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>This increase incorporates the adjustment otherwise due in March 1993 and includes an additional amount. </PARA>
<PARA>This additional amount will be provided to the older, long-term unemployed, and to most of the unemployed with dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>From April next year, all full and part pensioners and older long-term beneficiaries will be eligible to receive the range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth, including hearing aids and a telephone allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>$44m will be provided for nursing homes over the next four years and a home equity loan scheme will be established for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Housing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister will also be announcing tonight a new long-term housing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the first steps in the strategy will be to provide an extra $24m in this year, rising to $40m in three years time, for rental housing managed by community organisations and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>$48m will be provided over three years to help 20,000 lower income earners buy equity in the public housing in which they live. This will also release capital to fund new homes for those in need. </PARA>
<PARA>And a new structure of rent assistance, to cost $71m next year, will benefit 440,000 low-income private renters, including about 300,000 pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Children</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Government will introduce a package to improve the affordability and efficiency of child care services. </PARA>
<PARA>The package includes an increase in the existing fee relief ceiling of $4 a week for each child in care. And it will provide for continued operational subsidies to community-based child care centres and family day care services. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will assist 135,000 families and will cost $68m over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>In a new initiative, up to $136.50 in family allowance will be available on request as a lump-sum advance to help meet unforeseen expenses. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Disabilities/Carers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Two years ago, the Government initiated measures to assist people with disabilities to enter the workforce and to participate fully in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight we are announcing further measures at a cost of $68m over four years which build on those reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional funding of $41m over four years will be provided for respite services to reduce the burden on carers of frail aged and disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>And the domiciliary nursing care benefit is to be increased to $26 a week from January next year and indexed thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aboriginal Australians</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget provides for the policies and programs to assist Aboriginal people which the Prime Minister recently announced. It also provides a total of $19m over four years for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Remote Areas</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Australians living in remote areas are often disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has thus decided to increase the income tax remote area zone rebates by 25 per cent from January next year. For people in the remotest areas of Australia, the base component will be $235 higher in a full year. Remote Area Allowances will be increased accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REVENUE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to revenue measures. </PARA>
<PARA>The major revenue initiatives include the increase in the Medicare levy and an increase of $5 a kilogram in tobacco excise. </PARA>
<PARA>This increase will raise the price of a packet of 30 cigarettes by up to 20 cents and reinforces our policies to reduce the health costs of smoking. It will raise $80m this year. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the continuing task of making the tax system fairer, from April next year, Fringe Benefits Tax will be applied to valuable car parking facilities&mdash;mainly in central business districts&mdash;that are provided by employers to their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, the tax benefits of limited partnerships will be restricted by taxing them on the same basis as companies. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has been framed with a realistic appreciation of the difficulties before us. </PARA>
<PARA>While net borrowing by the public sector is expected to be the same as last year, the Budget deficit will represent an estimated 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will eliminate the deficit as soon as possible. We shall introduce our announced personal income tax cuts. And the Budget deficit will fall as economic recovery strengthens.</PARA>
<PARA>Outlays will fall over the period to 1995-96. But in the absence of new measures, revenues are also likely to decline. </PARA>
<PARA>If the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes&mdash;referred to in the Budget Statements&mdash;would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between 1/2 per cent and 1 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia will grow more quickly this year than last. Australia is once again on the move. </PARA>
<PARA>Output is forecast to increase by $22 billion this year, creating around 160,000 jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recovery this year will continue to be aided by growth in private consumption, in housing and in public sector investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>And business investment in plant and equipment, which is crucial to long-term job growth, is expected to turn around this year, making a modest contribution to the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will continue to be the top priority of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will take pressure off interest rates and keep low the cost of borrowing to firms and families. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will fortify our competitive position and so spur economic and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The current account deficit is forecast to widen to 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product, in part owing to investment growth. This is below the levels experienced in earlier years, due in no small part to our impressive export performance. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUSION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Over the past decade, this Government has progressively reformed the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>We are working to see our manufacturing and service sectors emulate the great record of our mining and rural industries by becoming dynamic and outward looking. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government also saw that our education system had to be reformed: from high schools through to universities. </PARA>
<PARA>With that reform, young Australians can acquire the skills necessary for the challenging jobs of the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has reformed the capacity of the public sector to support the process of economic and social transition. </PARA>
<PARA>Much has already been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia, our companies and all working men and women are now better able to seize the opportunities offered by a changing world. </PARA>
<PARA>We need only the resolve to seize those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget shows that resolve. </PARA>
<PARA>But that resolve must continue to be matched by our care for those in the community who cannot immediately benefit from those economic opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget demonstrates that care. </PARA>
<PARA>And while Australia is better placed for future growth as the world economy recovers, we are determined to take action to provide jobs, by using all the means at our disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget takes that action. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit. The Budget deficit in prospect for 1992-93 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $6 billion greater than the Budget deficit. This situation arises because appropriations from the Fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than Budget outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that otherwise would have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund. The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small. I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February of this year the High Court of Australia found amendments made by the Parliament in 1986 in relation to these pools to be of no effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendments was to overcome an anomaly in the sales tax law that some pools were subject to tax while others were exempt.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unfortunate effect of the decision, however, is that pool builders, who were able to pass on to purchasers any amounts payable to the Commissioner of Taxation as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, may have been able to get the benefit of refunds payable by the Commonwealth as windfall gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will ensure, in line with the refund code in the sales tax law, that there are no windfall gains and any refunds paid by the Commonwealth as a result of the Court's decision go to the person who actually bore the `tax'. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this Bill is not to deny the Commonwealth's liability to refund amounts paid as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, but rather to place a condition on the eligibility of a pool builder to a refund by requiring that, if the amount paid as sales tax was passed on to the purchaser, the refund must also be passed on. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Woollen products used include carpets, drapes, wall panels, furnishing materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The carpets in the Main Committee Room and the Cabinet Suite are of 100% Australian origin. Other carpets in Parliament House were supplied by 3 different Australian carpet companies. The tenders for the carpet did not specify Australian carpet wools. With few exceptions the carpets supplied are 80% wool and 20% nylon blend. Under the conditions of tender, companies were required to indicate the source of the materials. As the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement with New Zealand treats New Zealand products as though they were Australian, no information on Australian wool content is available.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint House Department does not have adequate information available about drapes, wall panels and furnishing materials which contain wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)The total cost to supply and lay carpets in Parliament House was approximately $4.2 million. The Joint House Department does not have adequate information available from which to determine the cost of other woollen products used in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)The total area of Parliament House, which is presently carpeted, is approximately 71 000 square metres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)No. In July 1986 the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) provided advice to the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House that tenders had been let for carpets in Parliament House. Following the tender assessment process it became apparent that no Australian carpet wool would be used in the building. PHCA advised the Joint Standing Committee of this situation and the decision was subsequently made by the Committee that two areas of the building should be fitted with pure wool carpets of 100% Australian origin. The areas fitted are, as stated in answer to part (2) of the request, the Main Committee Room and the Cabinet Suite. A copy of the PHC advice follows.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CARPET CONTRACTS</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contracts for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the new Parliament House were let by the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) earlier this year. Three separate contracts were let for carpet requirements for the building. Details of each contract package are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.United Carpet Mills of Preston Victoria won the contract to the value of approximately $1 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the House of Representatives office wings (18,657m(2)).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carpet is the be manufactured in Victoria using an international blend for the wool component (60% NZ, 20% British and 20% East Indian).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Corporate Carpet Installation Services (Joint Venture of Solomons Carpets of Adelaide and Feltex Carpets of NZ) won the contract of approximately $3 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet in the public and ceremonial areas of the building, the Ministerial wing and the Senate office wings (50,421m(2)). Manufacture of these carpets will be split between Australia and New Zealand. Approximately 40% of the total contract value will be Australian involvement. These carpets were tendered on the basis of 100% NZ wool, however, the contractor has undertaken to maximise the use of Australian wool within the contract price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Sexton Low Trading Co Pty Ltd of Brisbane won the contract of approximately $0.2 million for the manufacture and installation of carpet for selected areas including the Senate and House of Representatives Chambers. These are hand tufted 100% wool carpets which will be manufactured overseas as there are no looms of sufficient size in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SPECIFICATIONS</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specifications for the carpets were developed in conjunction with the Australian Wool Corporation and drew heavily on the Parliament's own experience with carpets in the provisional building. With few exceptions the carpets are of an 80% wool and 20% nylon blend.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tender specifications dealt with fibre, blend and performance and not the origin of the materials. Tenderers were required to nominate the origin/source of the materials in their tender bids. There was therefore no restriction on the tendering of Australian wool for the wool content of the carpets.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tender documents did not specify the origin of the wool component of the carpets. Tenders proposing Australian wool content were submitted. In general the prices submitted for such bids were 50% higher than the lowest tendered prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CER&mdash;TRADE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with the other contracts for the project, the CER provisions relating to trade between Australia and New Zealand applied to the carpet tenders. This has the effect of treating NZ products on an equal basis with Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DECISION TO USE 100% AUSTRALIAN CARPET WOOLS IN SELECTED AREAS</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became apparent following the tender assessment process that no Australian carpet wool would be used in the building. The PHCA advised the Joint Standing Committee of this situation and the decision was subsequently made by the Committee that two areas of the building should be fitted with pure wool carpets of 100% Australian origin.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JSC directed that the Cabinet Suite (673m(2)) and the main Committee Room (298m(2)) should feature all woollen carpets of 100% Australian origin. These are both prestigious areas of the building, and in the case of the Main Committee Room will be accessible to the public. The Authority has finalised arrangements with Corporate Carpet Installation Services, the contractor for the area concerned, for the provision of 100% Australian woollen carpets in these spaces.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABC buys 50% of the programs it puts to air and either co-produces or produces itself the other 50%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining its internal Budget priorities for 1991-92 the ABC did not have sufficient funds to make Everybody, Holiday or Hypotheticals.  Funds however were set aside for the ABC to make The Investigators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of Everybody and Holiday from the production plan was a disappointment to the ABC and it believed this would prove disappointing to the audience.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr Free</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Since 1983-84, capital funds have been regarded as part of CSIRO's global budget. Some projects, including National Facilities, have been specifically provided for by Government. The table at Attachment A shows expenditure of appropriation funds on capital in 1990-91 dollars for each year from 1983-84 to 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Meaningful calculation of variations between years is extremely difficult. This is due to such factors as the allocation of additional capital funds to CSIRO for specific projects and changes in the threshold which defines capital as opposed to annual expenditure. Nevertheless, the figures at Attachment A enable percentage variations between various years to be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The table at Attachment A enables any averages required to be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The table at Attachment B sets out CSIRO's appropriations for the periods 1983-84 to 1991-92. The figures for 1991-92 are estimates and do not include additional funds requested in the Additional Estimates process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The table at Attachment B enables any percentage variations between various years to be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) and (7) Total appropriations in any year include funding for specific projects, the construction of National Facilities, as well as new responsibilities. Meaningful comparisons are therefore difficult. Notable new responsibilities reflected in CSIRO's direct appropriation figures in recent years include the Ultrasonics Institute, the Australian Fish Health Reference Laboratory and the National Building Technology Centre. It would be extremely difficult to take account of all such instances in the data sought, and the issue of real value maintenance is therefore complex. The table at Attachment B enables any percentage variations to be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) CSIRO's expenditure of external earnings, including earned revenue (e.g. royalties, sale of assets), for the financial years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91 was $138.0M, $136.1M and $156.7M respectively. All external earnings are retained by CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) and (10) The table at Attachment C sets out the information required. However, the categories requested in this part vary slightly from the method of categorisation usually used within CSIRO. Included in (a) are Rural Industry Research Funds, NERDDC, other competitive funding schemes and other funding from Commonwealth and State Departments. Category (b) excludes other funding from Commonwealth and State Departments. Category (d) comprises funding from Australian Industry, Overseas Bodies and Donations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) A target for external funding as a percentage of total budget was introduced for CSIRO in 1988; the Government's expectation was that, by 1991, the Organisation would be meeting 30% of its total expenditure from non-appropriation sources. The policy was reconfirmed for the 1991-92 to 1993-94 triennium, acknowledging that there should be flexibility to allow the quality and relevance of the research output and general community benefit to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The table at Attachment D sets out CSIRO's expenditure by source of funds (in 1990-91 dollars) for the period from 1983-84 to 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) and (15) The table at Attachment E sets out estimates of expenditure against sponsored research funds and earned revenue for each division for 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) CSIRO estimates its ongoing requirements to be $21.5 million per annum for replacement and refurbishment and $13.5 million per annum for repairs and maintenance of existing building assets (in 1990-91 dollars). In addition, some $2 million per annum is being spent on major items of equipment which are categorised as capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) CSIRO has assessed its capital requirements on an individual divisional basis and quantified them on a technical and financial project by project basis. The quantified assessments are reflected in CSIRO's Capital Investment Plan which amounts to approximately $114 million over the triennium, including repairs and maintenance and major items of equipment. It is not necessary for me to endorse the assessments. I do approve CSIRO's annual budget which is designed by the Organisation to achieve a balance between its capital infrastructure and research priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) CSIRO has developed a Capital Investment Plan for the current triennium based on these quantified requirements which reflect the Organisation's priority areas. Attachment F lists fourteen major projects included in this plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) As outlined in answers to parts (16), (17) and (18) above, CSIRO is planning to allocate $114 million during the current triennium ($45 million in 1991-92, $43 million in 1992-93 and $26 million in 1993-94) in support of its capital infrastructure. In addition, the Government has provided a $10 million loan to CSIRO to accelerate the self-funded redevelopment of its North Ryde site. Specific projects and funding arrangements beyond 1993-94 have not yet been decided.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The methodology for determining the quantum of items that have to be disclosed in a company's financial statements and the recommended manner of disclosure are set out in accounting standards which are made by the Australian Accounting Standards Board rather than in auditing standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Corporations Law a company's directors are required to prepare financial statements that present a true and fair view of both the profit or loss of the company for the financial year to which the financial statements relate and the state of the company's affairs as at the end of that financial year. When preparing their company's financial statements, directors are required to comply with the requirements of Schedule 5 to the Corporations Regulations and the requirements of all applicable accounting standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible for accounting standards to address every conceivable situation, and the application of an accounting standard in a particular case will often be a matter of judgement. What is important is that mechanisms are in place to ensure that directors are not able to use loose interpretations of standards to provide a misleading impression of the financial position of their company. It is in this area that the Government and its agencies have moved on a number of fronts since the national scheme for corporate regulation commenced operation on 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Government has brought forward legislation to make the use of accounting standards mandatory. The effect of the amendment is that the financial statements of a company must be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and, where the use of those accounting standards would result in the financial statements not presenting a true and fair view of the matters required to be dealt with in the financial statements, the additional information needed to present a true and fair view must also be disclosed. Prior to this amendment being made, the directors of a company did not have to comply with an applicable accounting standard if, in the directors' opinion, such compliance would result in the financial statements not giving a true and fair view&mdash;a situation that, in effect, allowed selective application of accounting standards and thus facilitated the use of misleading "creative accounting".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Australian Accounting Standards Board has set itself a heavy work program involving the revision of older accounting standards and the development and making of new standards in respect of matters that are not currently covered by standards (for example, disclosure of employee benefits and accounting for financial instruments).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of a recently revised standard is the standard on valuations, which was strengthened for financial years ending on or after 31 December 1991. It is understood that the commencement of this revised standard, together with the new rules on compulsory application of standards (which also apply to financial years ending on or after 31 December 1991), caused the recent large write-downs by some companies, a development which can only be expected to provide those companies with sounder balance sheets for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is a need to check that the new rules are being applied. The Australian Securities Commission's compliance program, upon which there is an increasing emphasis, should help ensure this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As the Australian Accounting Standards Board is an independent body established under section 224 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, it would be improper for me to seek to direct the Board to take a particular course of action in respect of any matter coming within its statutory responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, an ongoing dialogue between the Board and the Attorney-General's Department on policy issues and, since 1 April 1992, a representative of the Department has attended Board meetings as an observer. The presence of the Departmental observer at Board meetings has already proved to be of considerable value to both the Board and the Government in coordinating action on accounting policy, so as to ensure that the accounts of Australian companies acquire an enhanced reputation for completeness and accuracy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department did publish, in November 1991, pursuant to the Marriage Act 1961, a brochure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Happily ever before and after</EMPHASIS> which is required to be provided to persons intending to marry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) (i) 392,500 copies of the brochure were printed. An equivalent amount was printed of an accompanying brochure, which details where persons may obtain marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation services from agencies which are approved and funded under the Family Services Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) 391,000 copies of each brochure were distributed to the State/Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages for distribution to authorised marriage celebrants. Twenty copies of each pamphlet were distributed to all marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation organisations funded under the Family Services Program. The remainder of the pamphlets were retained within the Department for supplementary distribution as required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The brochure was withdrawn after it was discovered that the pamphlet contained an incorrect statement of law in some States. The information was corrected and the revised pamphlet was reprinted in February and released in March 1992. As there was no defect with the list of service providers, there was no cause to withdraw this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The cost of publishing and distributing the original document and list was $26,379. The cost of replacing and distribution of the 391,000 brochures was $16,355. It must be noted that this document was a new edition and therefore all stocks held by celebrants in Australia were no longer valid and required replacement. In an average year, the Department would print a number of these documents consistent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on Marriages registered. The average yearly cost of printing these documents would therefore be around $5,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All of the Army's seven general reserve brigades are potentially available for deployment and manoeuvre. Four of these brigades (4, 9, 11 and 13 Brigades) have also been given the specific training task of preparing for vital asset protection in Northern Australia. The employment of these brigades in any future conflict would be determined by the Government and the Chief of the Defence Force at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Two regular, one Ready Reserve and seven general reserve brigades are currently available for the Defence of Australia. Should a threat to Australia arise the Chief of the Defence Force would task the brigades in the most effective and appropriate way. These ten brigades could be augmented by the raising of additional forces if required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Defence preparedness is structured to be able to respond to warning. Force Elements are required to mobilise within a stipulated readiness notice to conduct peacetime tasks or operations associated with contingencies credible in the shorter term. Army Force Elements on very short notice are generally able to meet all assigned roles and tasks. Preparedness shortfalls that occur occasionally for these Force Elements are manageable. The specific preparedness of Force Elements is classified information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Present contingency plans for the defence of Australia address the nature and scope of potential threats in the light of the enduring features of Australia's geo-strategic situation. The Defence of Australia includes all parts of Australia, both south and north of the Tropic of Capricorn. In response to the strategic guidance contained in the 198~ White Paper and subsequent ministerial statements, the Australian Army will progressively move a regular brigade to Darwin between 1993 and 2000. Like the Ready Deployment Force Brigade based in Townsville, the Darwin Brigade will enjoy the advantages of acclimatisation and access to training areas in northern Australia. The majority of Army's combat formations, however, the Ready Reserve brigade and six of the seven General Reserve brigades will remain based south of the Tropic of Capricorn. This balance of regular forces in the north and reserve forces in the south is consistent with strategic guidance and the readiness posture that follows from it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I do not accept that bureaucratic red tape is preventing the development of value added meat exports.  There are very specific requirements that have to be met by exporters of meat and meat products.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Australian Meat Health Certificates are government to government documents that have been negotiated with importing country authorities.  It is a long standing policy that is internationally recognised and accepted that such certificates are not issued with corrections.  To do so could bring into question the standing of the Australian certification system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A system of initialling minor corrections would not be acceptable to the majority of Australia's meat trading partners.  The main reason for this is that there are problems associated with the recognition of initials and overseas authorities have no way of knowing whether the correction was done in Australia by AQIS or elsewhere.  Any wrongful alteration could place the whole of Australia's export meat trade to that destination at risk.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) must be viewed in the context of a prolonged period of wage restraint on the part of wage and salary earners. The SGC will be more than funded by the substantial improvements in productivity which are anticipated to flow from the progression of workplace and labour market reform initiatives and the Government's other structural reforms. In fact, expected productivity gains during the scheduled period cover aggregate contributions several times over. As noted in the Treasurer's press release of 16 May 1992, the impact of the SGC will also be taken into account in any national wage rise in 1992-93, so that it will in no way jeopardise the Accord commitment to achieving wage outcomes which are consistent with maintaining an inflation rate which is comparable with those of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The discipline shown by wage and salary earners is in stark contrast to the excessive increases in executive remuneration during the same period. A recent survey by Noble Lowndes Cullen Egan Dell reveals that total remuneration for managers increased by an average of 5.3 per cent over the year to March 1992. The corresponding figure for senior managers is 7.1 per cent. In comparison, average weekly earnings for wage and salary earners increased by just 2.2 per cent over the year to February 1992. The continued failure of executives to demonstrate restraint similar to that shown by wage and salary earners could have serious implications for the stability of the wages system as the economy moves more strongly into recovery.</PARA>
