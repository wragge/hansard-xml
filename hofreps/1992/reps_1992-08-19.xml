<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. It needs to be understood that, in relation to the procedures and the relationship of the two chambers of the Australian Parliament, there are several aspects of concern. The first is that the Government has decided on a number of occasions to introduce the guillotine. On the day this particular matter was before this House, totally inadequate time was provided for an adequate consideration of what is a very serious public issue. I think the Government itself has to accept responsibility for the confusion that has arisen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the guillotine, this place is not given a proper opportunity to consider the nuances of legislation and, more and more as a result of the application of the guillotine, it is now the Senate which is deciding significant matters of government policy. It is all very well for the Government to say, `Oh, but we haven't got the numbers there or we haven't got the numbers here, so we will pass things through in a perfunctory fashion'. As I see it, that is not the role and responsibility of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I make in relation to this suspension of Standing Orders, which significantly relates to the reason this place did not debate the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill, is that the Government, by using the guillotine the way it is, is denying members of the House of Representatives the proper opportunity to scrutinise legislation. I think it is despicable; I think it is an indictment on the Government, and it reflects very much the whole core of its administration. The reason we have this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that the Government believes it is essential to correct an error that resulted from the expeditious passage of amendments in the Senate that were then transferred back to this chamber. The first point is that the Government has to accept full responsibility for the failure of the legislation to be passed as was intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that it is quite critical that the certification, which is necessary before matters of this sort go to the Governor-General for signature, accords with the will of the two chambers. I commend the Clerk of the House for the action he took in accepting that the legislation was not what the House considered it to be when it was deliberated upon. I know that official advice was given by Government departments to the Clerk that changes were made to the actual amendment made in the Senate. I know that in the current interpretations provided by the High Court there has been a tendency to look at the whole debate in considering any doubt upon particular wording of legislation. I do not think a House of Parliament can be treated in any casual, perfunctory manner. I think if legislation is before us, even though we may not have the numbers on this side of the House, we should have an opportunity to deliberate upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was that we did not as a chamber deliberate on the same matters considered in the Senate. For that reason it would have been diminished in its stature. As my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) says, the certificate was provided on the basis that it was the intention of the House of Representatives to accept whatever amendments the Senate might have passed to us. That is the key issue. This House does not accept as a matter of casual reference what the Senate passes. We have an authority right on our own behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Clerk of this chamber deserves to be commended for the way in which he acted and the way in which he upheld the status and dignity of not only the chamber but also every member of this place. Mr Speaker, I commend both you and the Clerk for acting formally in accordance with the responsibilities that you exercise on our behalf. There might be some matters on which I disagree with your interpretation of Standing Orders, Mr Speaker, but on this occasion I believe you have actually done the right thing. That deserves to be put on record. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is that we are now being called on to deliberate on a significant and sensitive proposal which had been put through this chamber on an incorrect basis. I know my colleague the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who is at the table, is about to talk on the substance of the Bill. I want only to say that as far as I am concerned I do not think it is good enough that matters of this sort are sent to the House and that, because the Senate decides what the legislation will be, we automatically accept them. We do not, and the action the Clerk and Mr Speaker have taken has demonstrated that the House of Representatives has a unique responsibility. I commend the Clerk and you, Mr Speaker, for the actions you have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the substance of the measure, I have no doubt the honourable member for Bradfield will speak in detail. Like he and every other member of the House, I regard this as being quite remarkable in its timing. This is one of the areas where the Government is adding to the imposition of business, at a time when it has produced a Budget which it says is about jobs. The reality is that this particular measure is denying jobs to people. This particular measure is one of the imposts on the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to endorse much of what has been said by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Mr Speaker, you will be aware that the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Parliament, and the Parliament consists of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is commonly overlooked that there are three elements to the Parliament, including the Queen. Of course, that is an institution that those on the other side would like to do away with at the current time. But unless a Bill goes through the House of Representatives and through the Senate and has the assent of the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, it does not become law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend the Clerk of the House who has taken a very proper constitutional position in relation to this particular incident. For in this particular incident the form of the Bill that was passed by the Senate was not the same as the form of the Bill passed by the House of Representatives. Therefore, it could not be certified for the Governor-General's assent, and could not become law under that provision of the Australian Constitution. If there had been a temptation to overlook that, that would have been an infringement of high constitutional position and an infringement of the law that governs this Parliament and all the actions that we engage in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the Clerk of the House for the stand that was taken. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the Governor-General who, quite properly in the circumstances, was unable to give royal assent to the actual Bill, which remains a Bill. It has never become an Act and has never become law. The purpose of this suspension of Standing Orders is to allow that error to be rectified in the proper way and, if it should be the case after due deliberation by this House and the Senate and assent by the Governor-General, for that matter to become law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to underline that this is the proper way in which to approach this particular problem, to bring it back to this House for rectification.

If the legislative power is not exercised in relation to a Bill with all of those three constituent parts, then the Bill does not become an Act and nobody has the right to treat it as an Act. It is necessary to come back, if need be to suspend Standing Orders, and to move a rectification. It would be a fundamental misconception to have treated the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill as anything other than a legislative proposal for the past couple of weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do that in a few moments time, and I will conclude on the suspension. When the suspension is opened up and it is then possible to move the motion in order to rectify an error of the House, it will be necessary at that stage for the House to take note of what has actually occurred, how it has actually occurred and why it was wrong as a matter of law that the Bill was treated as anything other than a legislative proposal in the interim and can only be rectified after the House has been satisfied as to both the procedure and the substance in relation to the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

In his remarks he said that the Governor-General was owed a debt of gratitude. Of course, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) pointed out in his contribution, and it should be known by the honourable member for Higgins, the reason we are at this stage is that I would not send the Bill to the Governor-General.

<PARA>The Opposition spokesmen like to give us civic lectures on these matters. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), chose to do so and, in so doing, revealed that, whatever he might know about constitutional and legal processes, he knows very little about the Standing Orders of the House. I suppose the House ought to be grateful that at least one useful purpose has been served by this debate here today: he has been able to be educated by your good self, Mr Speaker, on important elements of those. That will not go amiss. </PARA>

The annexed schedule contained 25 amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 June 1992, the message was reported in the House of Representatives and ordered to be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 June 1992, the revised Bill was received from the AGPS and checked in anticipation of its forwarding to the Governor-General for royal assent. Shortly before its anticipated transmission, advice was received from both the Australian Taxation Office and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that they believed four of the amendments contained in the schedule of amendments received from the Senate had not been made by the Senate. Oral inquiries were initiated with officers of the Senate to ascertain the position. On 30 June it was confirmed that four of the amendments were not in fact made by the Senate. As a consequence of this error, the House of Representatives had been asked to agree, and had agreed, to four amendments which had not been made by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the view that the bill cannot proceed is mistaken. In accordance with the usual procedures, the House of Representatives passed a resolution the effect of which is to agree to the amendments made by the Senate in the bill. That resolution did not have the effect of endorsing the erroneous schedule. It is the documentary record of the proceedings which is incorrect, not the proceedings in either House, the effect and intention of which are perfectly clear. To say that the bill now cannot pass because of the error in the schedule is to say that the erroneous record of proceedings prevails over the proceedings themselves. It is not correct, as the government's advisers seem to have concluded, that the Houses have not agreed to the bill in the same form. It is clear that the Houses have agreed to the same bill; it is the documentary record of that process which is inaccurate. The record should be amended to reflect the proceedings, rather than the proceedings altered to reflect the record.</PARA>
<PARA>To amend the record `to reflect the proceedings, rather than the proceedings altered to reflect the record' would have been perfectly in order in respect of the Senate proceedings. If a corrected schedule of amendments was sent to the House of Representatives in substitution for that sent previously before the House acted, it would have reflected what actually did happen in the Senate. However, to suggest that `it is the documentary record of proceedings which is incorrect, not the proceedings in either House, the effect and intention of which are perfectly clear' ignores what occurred in the House of Representatives. The House actually agreed to 25 `amendments', a schedule of which had been circulated in the chamber as amendments made by the Senate. We now know that four of them had not been made by the Senate. It is not possible to ignore the fact that, because of the error in the Senate schedule, the House had agreed to a different version of the Bill and no amendment of the record will alter that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision in the Standing Orders of the House for the correction of errors of a verbal, formal, clerical or typographical nature. Standing order 241 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments of a verbal or formal nature may be made, and clerical or typographical errors may be corrected, in any part of the bill by the Clerk acting with the authority of the Chairman of Committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Such errors are regularly corrected. In this case the four amendments included in the Senate schedule in error were amendments of substance which could not be dealt with under this provision. The error may have been a simple, and indeed an understandable, one. Perhaps it was a clerical error. It could have been corrected if detected before the House acted, but the House had acted on the basis of material received and circulated. It endorsed this material, erroneous as the material was. This stage having been reached, it was concluded, rightly it is submitted, that the matter was past the stage where it could be corrected under the provisions of standing order 241. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I went into that fairly lengthy explanation is that I think the process in which we have been engaged in terms of the Standing Orders and procedures and relations between the two Houses actually has been quite important, and it is fairly important to put on the record here the views&mdash;as indeed the views of various of the Senate Clerks on these matters have been put on the record in the Senate&mdash;of the way in which you, Mr Speaker, arrived at your decisions and the Clerks advised you to arrive at those particular decisions, as there are elements of precedent involved here. There is no point, I believe, in getting into blaming anyone for the particular processes that produced this situation. Clearly we in this place do rely, in practical terms in our operations here, on receiving correct advice from the Senate on what have actually been its proceedings. It is all very well to call upon Ministers to read avidly through the plethora of amendments that the Senate passes on to this place and arrive at correct conclusions about them. The fact is that towards the end of a session no government is in a position to ensure that this proceeding takes place absolutely. I think Ministers are entitled to anticipate&mdash;because in general this is the case&mdash;that the materials that are received from the Senate accurately reflect what was passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though we are inexperienced in these matters. Hundreds of Bills in a parliament are amended by the Senate and arrive back here on the basis of perfectly correct advice as to what the Senate's intentions were in dealing with them. In this case this did not occur. Therefore, how it ought to be handled and how it ought to be fixed required a degree of deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appeared to be some criticism outside the provision of Standing Orders emerging from the last Opposition speaker on whether or not it is right for people to act as though Bills had been enacted. He would be aware that, in the area of the operations of the Treasury and with taxation legislation in particular, when the Taxation Commissioner finds, for example, a practice of which he disapproves but which requires legislation to be corrected, there is an automatic assumption that any particular activity is backdated to that time, irrespective of whether or not legislation has been passed by the House correcting that particular problem. There is much less of a purist practice in this regard than he would have us believe, at least by the sorts of remarks that he made during the discussion on the motion for the suspension of standing and sessional orders. I think that the Treasury and the Minister have conducted themselves perfectly appropriately in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will add one comment of my own with regard to this matter. I am not completely convinced that, having discovered this error, the Senate needed to go through the process of debating this all over again yesterday. In my view, all that was required of the Senate was that, as soon as the error was discovered, it transmit to us a correct version of events. The exercise which took place in the Senate yesterday concerning this matter was a waste of its time. I think it would have more sensibly established the correct way of handling such matters if it had made a simple decision to correct its advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of precedent, what occurred in the Senate yesterday was more than a little unfortunate. Basically, the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have adopted a very sensible approach to this matter. They want to see the process corrected. Therefore, the full implications of what the Senate did yesterday are not necessarily revealed to us because of that restraint on the part of the Opposition and the Democrats in their handling of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one could envisage, by way of precedent, an opportunity arising from this for people capable of getting a Senate majority&mdash;or even if they do not have a Senate majority&mdash;to create quite a deal of mischief in handling a particular piece of legislation. The fact of the matter is that the voting system we have in this country means that no government will ever control the Senate&mdash;certainly not control it reliably&mdash;for any lengthy period of time. The Senate, with its plethora of parties, Independents and the like, will produce for time everlasting situations when governments and the House will be held hostage to a fairly knock-about attitude to material before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting a piece of legislation out of the Senate is, from time to time, like extracting blood from a stone. When it finally appears one is very grateful. Then we find that, through absolutely no fault of the House, because an error has been made in the transmission of materials from the Senate, it can go through the whole darn process again. This is disruptive of the legislative process in a totally unnecessary way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that it was open to the Democrats and the Opposition&mdash;because, I think erroneously, this matter was placed back in the hands of the Senate&mdash;to play exactly that role in this instance. They chose not to do that, so this is not a criticism directed at them in any way, shape or form. I simply point out that as we are dealing here with a whole series of precedents as to how this material ought to be handled in the future, it is necessary to draw attention to the consequences of one of the precedents that have been set in the way in which this matter has been handled. I only hope that the Presiding Officer in the Senate will give due consideration to whether or not absolutely everything that he did in this instance in requiring this matter to come back before the Senate for consideration was entirely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any quarrel at all with the way in which you have handled this matter, Mr Speaker. I think it would also be fair to place it on record that, in the opinion of the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, the Senate's consideration of this matter yesterday was not required. I think that would probably also reflect the opinion of the Clerks here&mdash;they cannot speak for themselves, but I will say that nevertheless&mdash;and also your opinion, Mr Speaker, on this matter. It is a matter of regret that we now have to consider this recission motion. I do not accept that any blame ought to be attributed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of a session it does not matter whether we are under guillotine or anything else. The process at the end of a session always requires activity of this nature by the Senate and the House of Representatives. Indeed, this has absolutely nothing to do with the guillotine; it does not matter whether there was any guillotine in place at all. At the end of the year, guillotine or otherwise, there is always pressure to complete legislation by the end of the session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well recollect times in the past when the Government and the Opposition have not legislated at the end of a session under guillotine but have legislated through the ordinary processes. We have arrived at precisely this position, where we have played ping-pong with the Senate in the last couple of days on legislation that came from the Senate. The alternative, of course, is to sit through Christmas or to sit through a period that has been scheduled as a parliamentary break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also do not accept that the guillotine produces hasty legislation that would not be corrected in this place. The vast bulk of the corrections to superannuation legislation by the Senate properly reflect political positions that have been arrived at. There is disagreement with Government policy and, because the Government does not have a majority in the Senate, its view is not able to prevail. The views of the Opposition and the Democrats do prevail under those circumstances. But this is not because the Bill has been incompetently drafted. It is because the Bill has been disagreed with by the Opposition in some area of principle and therefore is returned to the House of Representatives. This would occur whether or not the original Bill came through under guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that somehow or other this is a product of the guillotine being applied is a nonsense. It is a product of the fact that at the end of the session there is always a rush of business between the Senate and the House of Representatives to get legislation through and in those circumstances mistakes can be made. There is no process that would avoid this error and this sort of situation developing. People can unctuously moralise about it, but no government has ever avoided the problem of a rush of consideration of legislation between the Senate and the House of Representatives&mdash;at least no government at a time when it has not controlled the Senate has been able to avoid this sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I anticipate a certain amount of unctuous moralising from those opposite on this subject. All I say in advance is that I do not cop that unctuous moralising at all. As I do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily, I will not spend any time rebutting those opposite, but because I do not spend any time rebutting them I do not want them for one minute to think that I concede on that point. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) correctly pointed out, we are not of the view that the suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders ought to have taken place in any event, but we are in an extraordinary position. Clearly, standing order 241, which allows a correction of a clerical nature, was unable to be availed of in this instance because the procedures had gone too far. We had formally accepted the message and moved to accept the amendments from the Senate. So the Clerk and the Speaker acted correctly, as has subsequently been shown to be so, in refusing to send a message to the Governor-General that the particular piece of legislation had received the royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter has therefore gone back to the Senate, has been corrected and has come back to the House of Representatives. It seeks from us the rescission of our previous motion where we acted upon advice from the Senate in accepting its amendments, so that we rescind and then put back in a piece of legislation that is the mirror image of what has been passed in the Senate. The Bill then, having passed through the constitutional processes, can correctly go to the Governor-General to receive the royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures that are followed in the Senate are a matter for the Senate. I do not want to enter into the arguments put forward by the Leader of the House that perhaps the Senate ought not to have entered into the debate of yesterday. That is a matter for the Senate. We might question whether or not we agree with those procedures, but the procedures in the Senate are a matter for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that the Leader of the House made is that this is not a debate about the guillotine. Certainly, it is not a debate about the guillotine. I have made the point in the past that as we come to the end of a session we invariably end up in the position where more and more legislation is being rushed through. Some of the errors that may have arisen here can be sheeted home to a lot of different reasons, but one of them surely has to be the nature of the rush that we engage ourselves in at the end of the session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the view that it is not sufficient, as I have said in the past, just to blame the Senate for that. It really is a matter of running government business in an ordered fashion and ensuring that Ministers bring to the Parliament in a timely fashion legislation that can be dealt with in the proper method by which we would all hope that this Parliament would proceed. It is not sufficient for the Government to say, `We always have to use the guillotine'. It is in the hands of the Leader of the House and the legislative committee of the Cabinet to order the priorities of the Government in such a fashion that it does not have to rely on excuses, as it does invariably. Increasingly, the excuse is that it is all the Senate's fault because of the Macklin amendment. That is a debate we have had and we will have again, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come back to the substantive issue that we have to deal with. We will now move into committee; the amendments will be moved by the Government to delete the offending clauses that we accepted on the advice of the Senate; we will be agreeing to the deletion of those amendments which we previously had agreed to; and we will debate the substantive issues on which this legislation hangs&mdash;that is, a levy on employers to fund superannuation and the heavy impost of that levy. That is a debate that my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), will be bringing forward; he will also relate some of the substantive matters raised by the Solicitor-General and our colleague in the Senate, Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will then come out of committee, having accepted those amendments, and the legislation will mirror what has been passed in the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few remarks, I reiterate that the decision taken by you, Mr Speaker, and also by the Clerk is proved to be and was the correct constitutional position.

The point I wanted to make is that when the rectification motion goes through&mdash;assuming that it goes through&mdash;the interesting question then becomes: what has been the situation from 1 July until such time as it goes through? The Leader of the House is putting the view that the guarantee charge will be considered to have been law throughout. The point that I was putting is that that is very much a matter that will be open to legal debate and no doubt will be challenged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is unquestionably an argument that will be put the other way. The point that arises from this is: even if the rectification motion does have the effect that it will have made the superannuation guarantee charge law as from 1 July 1992, nobody was entitled in the interregnum to assume that. Nobody was entitled, until such time as the rectification motion was put, and nobody is entitled to assume until this rectification motion is passed, that the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill was law from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House adverted to that himself. He said that the Commissioner of Taxation was entitled to go out and advertise and treat this as law, assuming that one day it would be picked up. He said that this was considered to be usual procedure. Well, it is not usual procedure to advertise, and expend public moneys on advertising, something as law when it is not law. It cannot become law until such time as it is passed in identical form through the House and the Senate and has received the royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that the rectification motion has been moved is that it is quite clear that that had not occurred. It is quite clear by reason of the rectification motion itself, even on the most generous assessment of the rectification motion, that once the royal assent is given&mdash;the commencement date comes into operation as from 1 July 1992&mdash;in the interregnum until today that Bill was not law and it was just untrue to be advertising on television as though it was, to be spending public moneys advertising on television as though it was and to have been informing the public that it was law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly it was not law and, even on the most generous assessment, could only retrospectively become law after today and after royal assent. To go around and pretend that the matter is a bit of a giggle, a bit of a laugh and a usual procedure is not only treating the Parliament with contempt&mdash;to say whether the Parliament passes this matter or not is unimportant&mdash;it is also treating its own motion with contempt. Its own motion, on the substantive provisions that it has, is an attempt to say that it is important to get it right; it is important to have the records completely in agreement; it is necessary for that to be the case before the royal assent can be given; it is necessary to have the royal assent for a Bill to become law; it is necessary to have a law for the expenditure of public funds; it is necessary that tax commissioners, like anybody else, regard themselves as being under the law; that their advertisements, which advertise to the public what the law is, are fair and accurate and not misleading; and that the expenditure of public funds occurs in relation to informing people what the law is once it has become law.

It is no light matter whatsoever, and it is no light matter for the Leader of the House. The Leader of the House is the Leader of one House of the Parliament and is somebody who ought to take that matter absolutely seriously.

Even on his own admission, even in his own rectification motion, even in his own speech today it is clear in his mind that, until today at least, this has not been law and nobody should have been given the apprehension that it was.

Firstly, contrary to the point made by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the problem was to a large degree caused by the Government's fixation with guillotining legislation during the closing weeks of the autumn session which resulted in this serious administrative error occurring. </PARA>

It was presented in the House of Representatives at 9.30 p.m., some 10 hours later. The original schedule as prepared in the Senate was said to contain 25 amendments when, in fact, there were only 21. On 25 June, the House agreed in good faith to those 25 amendments contained in the Senate schedule. The error was subsequently discovered by the Tax Office as well as by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate acquaints the House of Representatives with a statement made by the President this day, regarding the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I inform the Senate that the schedule of amendments made by the Senate to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 which was forwarded with the bill to the House of Representatives on 24 June 1992 mistakenly included four amendments which were in fact not agreed to by the Senate. The presence of these amendments in the schedule was not detected when the House of Representatives agreed to the bill as amended by the Senate later on that day, and was not detected until both Houses had risen for the winter long adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate took the view that, as the intention of the two Houses was clear, the problem could be overcome by the correction of the erroneous documentary record and the bill could proceed to royal assent as amended by the Senate. The Government, on contrary advice, came to the conclusion that the bill could not proceed to royal assent and that it would be necessary for the error to be corrected by some action by the two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view initially taken by the Government's advisers was that the Senate would need to correct the error by resolution, either by asking for the bill to be returned to the Senate or by formally advising the House of Representatives of the corrected schedule of amendments. Subsequently, however, the view was expressed that the problem could be overcome by my signing a substitute message forwarding a substitute schedule of amendments to the House, without any further action by the Senate. On the advice of the Clerk, I took the view that it would not be proper for me to do this, and that the Senate should be acquainted with the problem and asked to take remedial action. I took this view particularly because the proposed date of commencement of the bill, 1 July 1992, had then passed, and there is a question as to whether the bill will operate retrospectively if it is now passed or whether further amendment is required to provide that retrospective operation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPINION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After passage through the House of Representatives the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 ("the Bill") was amended in the Senate. Due to clerical error (in its root sense of meaning error by a clerk) the signed Schedule of Amendments ("Schedule") annexed to Message 491 24 June 1992 from the President of the Senate to the Speaker included some purported amendments which had not been passed in the Senate. The error was not exposed until after the House of Representatives had agreed to all the purported amendments in the Schedule before assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President has not yet sent a message to the Speaker to correct the error of Message 491. 1 am instructed that the Clerk of the Senate has expressed a personal view that whilst the error could have been corrected administratively before 1 July without further reference to either House, rectification now requires resolution by the Senate. This is because the commencement Clause 2 reads "This Act commences on 1 July 1992", a date now passed. The suggestion is that the Bill has therefore become a Bill for retrospective legislation, and effectively a new Bill, if brought into force in the form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am asked&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is there any legal impediment to the President now transmitting the correct schedule to the House without reference to the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) May the Bill be passed by the House of Representatives with the same amendments passed by the Senate, and then presented for assent under section 58 of the Constitution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Would such enactment have effect from 1 July 1992?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Was the Clerk correct in his view that the error could have been corrected administratively before 1 July?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Chapter 20 of the Senate Standing Orders regulates the passage of Bills through the Senate. Under S.O. 131, a Bill which has originated in the House of Representatives and been passed by the Senate with amendments is returned to the House by message from the President with the amendments set out in a schedule certified by the Clerk. However, S.O. 131 prescribes only a parliamentary procedure. It does not reflect any constitutional requirement to pass a law (cf. procedures under section 57 of the Constitution in respect of the enactment of legislation at a joint sitting). The correction or non-correction of Message 491 by further message from the President will not affect the efficacy of the completed passage of the Bill through the Senate. Constitutionally it is not a necessary pre-condition to the House reconsidering the Bill amended by the Senate that the schedule of amendments passed by the Senate be correctly, or even at all, transmitted with message under S.O. 131 from the President to the Speaker. What is required is that the proposed law be passed in the same terms in each House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Where, as here, a Bill originates in the House and is passed by the Senate, the courts will not ordinarily inquire whether the internal procedures of Parliament have been complied with. The High Court has expressed the view that it is for each House to determine whether a law has been passed by each House according to its procedures, and the assent is taken as indicating that the Bill has been passed by each House: see Victoria v. Commonwealth and Connor (PMA Case) (1975) 1 34 CLR 81, 181 Mason J. At 164, Gibbs J. said the courts are not concerned with enforcement of Standing Orders of the two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Although there must be limits to the extent to which the High Court will foreclose consideration of parliamentary processes in constitutional litigation, it is unnecessary to consider issues of judicial review in resolving this matter of parliamentary process. Obviously, each House must rely upon the other to comply with its procedures, and it cannot be a proper working of the relationship for material normally communicated by one to the other to remain uncorrected after error is detected. Message 491 should have been formally corrected by a further message from the President to the Speaker as soon as the mistake was exposed, and no authority from the Senate was required before or after 1 July. The fact that a law proclaimed in the form passed by the Senate after 1 July will contain a commencement date in incorrect tense is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Section 58 of the Constitution allows the Governor-General to assent to a proposed law only after it has been "passed by both Houses of the Parliament". The constitutional requirement is that the substantive text be passed in each House. Here different amendments have been passed. Section 58 has not been complied with. It follows that no present version of the proposed law may be presented for assent. There is no scope for a text to be finalised by administrative action to express the supposed will of the Parliament. As the proposed law has not been passed by both Houses it cannot be presented for assent, either in the form passed in the Senate or with the purported amendments agreed to by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The mechanism to ensure passing of the Bill in compliance with constitutional requirements is a separate issue from correction of the President's advice to the Speaker. The House of Representatives may now agree to the amendments as they were in fact passed by the Senate. It then should send a new message under its Standing Order 247 explaining that its earlier message under that Standing Order was ineffective insofar as it said that the House had agreed to the amendments that were not in fact made by the Senate and stating that it has now agreed to all the amendments made by the Senate. Then the same proposed law will have been agreed to, and so "passed" by both Houses. In that form, the Bill may be presented for assent under section 58. This can be done even if no correcting message is sent by the President of the Senate to the Speaker. No further consideration by the Senate is required. Nonetheless, as a matter of practice between the Houses, it is appropriate for the President to correct message 491 before the House of Representatives considers and agrees to the correct schedule of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Upon assent, the commencement date is a matter of construction: see Worrall v. Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1917) 24 CLR 28. The infelicity in the tense of clause 2 will be explained by legislative history. For the avoidance of doubt, this intention for retrospective operation could be expounded and explained in the Minister's speech when the correct amendments are agreed on the further consideration of the Bill in the House of Representatives. In the peculiar circumstances of the passage of this law, a court should find that the Act does have retrospective operation back to the originally intended prospective date of 1 July 1992. This may, in turn, give rise to some other arguments as to whether the purported retrospective operation of the Act back to 1 July is valid, but those arguments could arise even if Clause 2 was amended directly to provide for retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the questions are answered as follows&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. No. The mistake in message number 491 should have been corrected as soon as it was detected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Act should be held to have effect from 1 July 1992.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly take the time of the House to refer to a number of points. Firstly, in the letter to the Speaker by the President, which was not read, he noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, on contrary advice, came to the conclusion that the bill could not proceed to royal assent and that it would be necessary for the error to be corrected by some action by the two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA>We have now gone through the process of subsequent actions. I think it also worth pointing out that the Government was facing a political dilemma. It faced the very real risk that had the Senate, in which it does not have a parliamentary majority, sought to make additional amendments, or sought to change the content of the legislation, the entire superannuation exercise would have unwound. The Leader of the House has made the point that senators on both sides showed remarkable commonsense in this particular matter; nevertheless, it did demonstrate that there was a political problem of some consequence. The President also said in his letter, and I think this point is quite important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a question as to whether the bill will operate retrospectively if it is now passed or whether further amendment is required to provide that retrospective operation. Having been acquainted with the problem, it is now for the Senate to take the appropriate action to have the bill reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA>In that context the comments made by the Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith, are particularly pertinent. The opinion asked of him fits into four basic questions. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is there any legal impediment to the President now transmitting the correct schedule to the House without reference to the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) May the Bill be passed by the House of Representatives with the same amendments passed by the Senate, and then presented for assent under section 58 of the Constitution?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Was the Clerk correct in his view that the error could have been corrected administratively before 1 July?</PARA>
<PARA>The only question to which I wish to refer in some detail is: would such enactment have effect from 1 July 1992?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the final page of his opinion, Dr Gavan Griffith referred specifically to the case of Worrall v. Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd, which was a 1917 case before the High Court. He stated&mdash;and this is the important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this intention for retrospective operation could be expounded and explained in the Minister's speech when the correct amendments are agreed on the further consideration of the Bill in the House of Representatives. In the peculiar circumstances of the passage of this law, a court should find that the Act does have retrospective operation back to the originally intended prospective date of 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>But he also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may, in turn, give rise to some other arguments as to whether the purported retrospective operation of the Act back to 1 July is valid, but those arguments could arise even if Clause 2 was amended directly to provide for retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA>So the points we are raising in this context are as follows: firstly, there was no royal assent; secondly, as has already been pointed out, the Tax Office, essentially as it appears of its own volition but possibly at the request of the Government, put out a press release advising employers that, irrespective of the finding of this problem which brought into question the legality of this legislation, they should have no doubt that they have the responsibility to pay their commitments, under a law which did not exist in legal terms, from 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Alston pointed out in the debate on this matter yesterday, the matter is important because `a Bill is presumed to have prospective operation only' if, as pointed out by Gavan Griffith, the Minister specifically in his second reading speech has drawn attention to the fact that the Bill has retrospective operation. Naturally that was not done, because at the time of the Minister's second reading speech it was presumed that this matter would be effectively legal. Senator Alston also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the normal course of events is to clearly and unequivocally prescribe the intention that a Bill has a retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA>We have now gone through the procedures. We are sorting out this unfortunate mess. But Senator Alston took the opportunity to raise a number of matters in relation to the substantive motion which he put to the Senate. I am not moving a motion in similar terms because there are no procedures by which I can do so. The four points he made yesterday are relevant and should be on the record. Senator Alston's motion in the Senate stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)condemns the Government for its unnecessary and indecent haste in rushing through the Parliament important legislation, which adversely affects the lives of millions of Australians, without allowing time for full and proper debate;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) condemns the Government for its failure to follow the proper processes in seeking to achieve retrospective operation of the legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) records its unequivocal opposition to the Government's compulsory superannuation regime which will severely punish ordinary Australian workers by requiring them to forgo wage increases and rising living standards in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) condemns the Government for embarking on a very expensive and highly misleading advertising campaign which pretends that the legislation is already in force, wrongly implies that employers are expected to bear the cost of compulsory superannuation and paints a very false and inflated picture of the amounts which are likely to be available to workers upon retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>Those points are important, especially (d). The Government deliberately set out to present a false impression of the benefits of its superannuation proposals and to present a very false impression that what was being asked of employers was appropriate in terms of the legislation which was technically illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, from day one we have in this place and in the Senate strenuously continued to argue that the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill is fundamentally based on a false premise, that it is not in the interests of the Australian people, especially at this time, and that effectively the Government is bringing into place a regime which is estimated to cost&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I do so in the context of the small business community, which I feel constitutes the main business base in my electorate. I do not want this opportunity to pass without again making very clearly the point that the superannuation guarantee levy has been a disaster right from the start. Today's episode, which has gone on for one hour now&mdash;much, I imagine, to the Government's embarrassment&mdash;to correct its mistakes and inadequacies merely compounds the error. In my view, what we have seen this morning, even by this Government's standards, is monumentally unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about that and about the lack of proper consideration of this matter. This, unfortunately, is typical of the way this Government has handled important legislation. The fact that this particular legislation was rammed through this Parliament without adequate consideration means that things are not done properly and, more importantly, that members in this place are not given the opportunity to represent their constituents properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) perhaps quite weakly said, the Senate is different; there is a mixture of parties there. But why is it that these things are given proper and detailed consideration in the Senate, when this is the House of the people? This is the place where these matters should be debated properly and fully. If that were to happen, we would not be relying on the Senate to do that work for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the importance of retirement incomes. There is no difference in views on both sides of this place. It is important that people are encouraged to provide for their retirement. I think that argument is well made and well understood. But in this case, the end does not justify the means. The point we have made consistently here is: while we agree that people must be encouraged to provide for their retirement, we do not support the compulsion; we do not support the imposition on employers. This end is not justified by this means. The superannuation guarantee levy is a tax on business at a time when business cannot afford it. </PARA>

It is like many things which this Government has done, wrongly and incorrectly in our view, and which contrast remarkably well with the approach that we would take to encourage people to provide for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this became law in a Clayton's sense, I have had in my office many examples of unintended consequences. How many times in the term of this Government have we been faced with so-called unintended consequences, where things that are not properly thought through, not properly planned and not properly executed have led to consequences which are unfortunate?  I have had people from small businesses phoning me saying that they do not know what to do with the levy; they cannot find an insurance company that wants to deal with them; their business is too small. There are numerous anomalies. People are phoning and saying, `What do we do?'. The hot line the Government set up has been virtually jammed with inquiries from employers who are simply confused about what the whole thing is all about, and it is easy to understand why they would be confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the role of the ACTU in this matter is, once again, disgraceful. It has dictated the terms of this whole saga. It has only been a matter of the ACTU Secretary or President saying to the Government, `Jump' and the Government's response of course has been, `How high?'. I do not want to take up too much time here because ultimately there is probably no point other than that I feel that I am doing my job as an elected representative in saying this again. The fact is that superannuation guarantee contributions will be fully preserved from 1 July 1993 but other contributions will not be required to be preserved until 1 July 1998. The Government has refused to accept the principle of competition between other financial institutions in this particular area because the ACTU does not want that competition; the ACTU does not want competition from outside with its so-called sponsored funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite our pleadings with the Government, the system still retains reasonable benefit limits complexities. We have pointed out that compulsory superannuation ultimately means reliance on the lowest common denominator. The Government has failed to address the issue of the preservation age. It acknowledges, and its own Ministers have acknowledged, the need for that preservation age to be increased to 60, and yet it has taken a Clayton's decision and has put it on the never never; it is going to look at it in the year 2025. Meanwhile, the system continues to haemorrhage as people are encouraged to double dip, and the amount of the haemorrhage could be as much as $1.5 billion per year. </PARA>

They cannot afford the level of taxes that are being imposed on them. I am proud to represent a party that has policies that will reduce tax for small business. The centrepiece of our approach to this small business policy is to get government off the back of small business and to reduce tax. I take the opportunity again this morning to say that I deplore the approach that has been taken on this matter by the Government. The whole sorry saga that we have seen repeated here this morning has convinced me more than ever that this approach to helping people provide for their retirement is entirely wrong and entirely misguided. I am pleased that the Opposition's policy is to discontinue it when we are elected at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue where I left off in my opening remarks. The point we are trying to get across quite clearly is that we have reached a stage where, to use a rather simplistic notion, one person's superannuation is another person's job. The evidence is quite clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Senate made certain amendments it was estimated that the cost of superannuation in terms of job loss would be approximately 100,000. It was subsequently revised down&mdash;depending on whom one wants to believe&mdash;to around 80,000. But the fact of the matter is that at this stage in the job cycle or, more correctly, in the gross unemployment cycle, any action which a government takes which deliberately and directly contributes to greater unemployment must be opposed by any self-respecting Opposition. It is not good enough to talk about a million people unemployed when we all know that that does not take account of the high level of underemployment estimated at another half a million people. It does not take account of the hundreds of thousands of people who have dropped out of the system because they simply believe there is no purpose in applying for work or being registered as unemployed. In other words, the estimate that we have of 11 per cent unemployment is at best optimistic and at worst a gross distortion of the sad reality brought upon this country by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we are emphasising in this debate that, in our opinion, employers do not carry with them a legal liability to pay superannuation up until the passage of this Bill through the House and subsequently its signature by the Governor-General. In other words, the current arrangements are illegal. They have been illegal ever since the original passage of the Bill on 25 June. Yet, as I said earlier, that did not hold back the Tax Office from putting out press releases and demanding that people make their payments. If the Government is taken to the courts by the CAI or any other employer body, it may well face the interesting question as to what the basis of that legislation was at that time and whether it was, in fact, retrospective. As I have stated, in quoting from Dr Gavan Griffith, there is certainly some doubt on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that, we are strongly urging the Government to give an assurance in the House today that it will not proceed to seek royal assent until it has obtained a further independent legal opinion, putting a further legal challenge beyond all reasonable doubt. Anything less than that is to leave this Parliament still in limbo, not knowing whether the retrospective elements in the original Bill, or as they could be interpreted in the court, are justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying in my earlier remarks, the superannuation issue before the Committee falls into a number of very fundamentally important questions. Firstly, there is the effect of the 80,000 to 100,000 people who will not be employed or whose current positions may well be lost. We should take account of the fact that, in recent months, we have seen a raft of legislation passed through this Parliament which has significantly increased the oncosts of employing labour. I recall that a few years ago we used to say it was 25 per cent; in other words, 100 per cent for wages plus 25 per cent for oncosts. That was an average which was applied across the economy. If we speak to employers today, essentially as a result of the introduction of a range of provisions in legislation, we find that that oncost is no less than 35 per cent and, in some cases, as high as 50 per cent. And we wonder why people are not creating job opportunities for their fellow Australians. It is very simple&mdash;they cannot afford to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, therefore, it is beholden upon this Parliament to make absolutely certain that every piece of legislation we pass has to go through the fundamental question or criterion of answering the issue: does it create new jobs or does it militate against the creation of new jobs? By any test at all, this legislation does nothing to increase employment opportunities for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues of relevance too. The proposals contained in this legislation effectively ignore the significant role of part time and casual employees in the Australian economic system. There are about 1 1/2 million people in that category, 75 per cent of whom are women. We have heard the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;the Prime Minister was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> again this morning&mdash;telling us how there has been a significant growth in the proportion of the population available for work and how this growth is much greater now than it was, say, in 1982. The Prime Minister totally ignores the fact that there has been a growth in the number of people available for work because they are living in a social and economic system where no family can survive today on average weekly earnings, or anywhere near approaching that, unless both the husband and the wife are actively involved in the work force. As I said, 75 per cent of women are in part time work or in casual employment. What does this legislation hold out for them for superannuation? What does it give to these people in their so-called financial independence in retirement?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, nothing; absolutely nothing. But we have a government which is full of compassion and concern!  We had a caring Budget last night, so we were told. The sad fact is that those hundreds of thousands of women in the work force expect and receive nothing from this Government in terms of superannuation reform. That is exactly the opposite of what the Opposition's superannuation policy is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have specifically identified the need to have an equitable system irrespective of income and the need to have a system in which all Australians&mdash;whether they be in or out of the work force, whether they be permanent or part time or casual employees&mdash;have the opportunity to access superannuation and the 25 per cent tax rebate on their contributions; that they have the opportunity to save for their long term retirement and have the opportunity through their savings to create work for other people and wealth for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the principles which must outline a sensible, decent, equitable superannuation policy. Regrettably, these are the principles which have been ignored for so long by this Government in its headlong desire to give its ACTU mates access to the savings of the Australian people in a most inequitable way. In the last 10 years this has effectively contributed to making the rich much richer than ever before and making the vast majority of the men and women who have worked to build this nation significantly worse off in real income terms than they have ever been before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This superannuation legislation is fundamentally flawed. It is not fit to be passed by this Parliament. As I said in the House last June, the Opposition will continue to vigorously oppose it in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One cannot escape from the fact that this reform means a decent retirement for virtually all Australians. If the Opposition wants to run in the next election on threatening to remove this essential protection for decent retirement from the vast bulk of the Australian work force and extending to them a privilege which the Liberal Party was pleased to keep ensconced firmly in the hands of only those who have been in government service or those who are wealthy in business, so be it. That is the policy that those opposite will pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the useful things as an election approaches&mdash;and it does not matter particularly about this election; it applies to any election&mdash;is that gradually the Opposition's policies, as opposed to simply the Government's, come into focus. It is terribly important that in this area the Opposition's policy does exactly that&mdash;comes into focus. In this area, as in education and employment policies generally, the Opposition's policy offers to the ordinary Australian not only no progress but also regression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly difficult to get in place in a country such as Australia something like superannuation, which is absolutely necessary and vital to any decent retirement policy. We had opportunities back in the 1920s and 1930s when various governments put forward national superannuation schemes. Indeed one was put forward by Mr Menzies, I think, and apparently it had the backing of the Opposition at that time. It fell between the cracks after the subsequent general election, despite the fact that it had bipartisan support. Had legislation been passed then, no doubt this is a debate we would not be having now. We would probably have superannuation organised on the most effective basis possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation has grown like Topsy since that time, but it has not grown in a fashion which the ordinary Australian can address unless the ordinary Australian happens to be a public servant. That is simply not acceptable any more. Therefore, a government has to have the courage to get up and prove that in the middle of a recession it can chew gum and walk at the same time; it can have employment policies and important social reforms proceeding and get about the business of doing it, which is exactly what this Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that have been created on jobs in this regard are a nonsense. It is a particular statistic which was given under heavy qualification and in that qualification process it was ultimately rejected by the Treasury advisers to the Government. But those opposite tout it as a figure which has some meaning. It has no meaning whatsoever. As far as achieving a decent lifestyle for ordinary people in this country for the long haul is concerned, it is critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe this Government will lose office but, if it does and this superannuation policy is interfered with, people will rue the day they ever put those opposite into office because people of my age in their forties and people younger than me in their thirties will not have the opportunities to be able to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. Indeed, they will probably suffer a very difficult lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of both employment for the long term and creating a pool of savings in this country, there has been absolutely no measure put in place by any Australian government which has had the effectiveness of this one in offering an opportunity for a pool of savings which can then be invested in our industry, thereby ensuring that our industry stays ahead of the game. It has a double benefit:  not only does it have the benefit of protecting us in our retirement but also it has the benefit of addressing the one thing that governments merely mouth about. Year in and year out all that governments generally say is, `We have to increase the savings rate of Australians'. But no government has ever been able to put in place any set of propositions which actually do that. From time to time governments have come up with schemes to remove the taxation of the interest on the first $2,000 worth of savings&mdash;all penny-ante stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An attitude towards savings in the community is there firstly because the community is oriented that way. Our community simply is not. There are many communities like that so we are not Robinson Crusoe in that regard. This is not a community that saves. I might say that on the basis of total propaganda presented to the community day in and day out, it is not encouraged to save, no matter what governments might say. Secondly, one creates savings through a process of government initiative which effectively obliges it, and this is it. This solves a fundamental economic problem in this country&mdash;a fundamental problem of retirement policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the odd bit of nibbling around the edges that the Senate has done in this particular instance, the complaints from the Opposition which go to the heart of the Bill are simply not justified in any shape or form. After this Bill has been set in place&mdash;it is useful for the public to understand that, given a few years to run, this will be an absolutely settled policy which will guarantee them a secure retirement&mdash;members of the Opposition are saying that they will do their level best to kill it, if they win the next election. Anybody who looks at their retirement seriously needs to consider that point. No matter what they might think of this Government on this or that policy, they ought to think about that policy very carefully because governments have tried for years and years to put superannuation policy in place and have failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the Opposition to wander around waving bits and pieces of paper saying, `This is what we would do'. The fact is that they have had opportunities year in and year out, as indeed governments of all particular political hues have had, to put such a measure in place but they never have. If the Opposition ever got into office that piece of paper would turn out exactly like Mr Menzies' national superannuation scheme&mdash;waved about and never put in place. It would achieve nothing for the ordinary Australian men and women, most of whom would not have an attitude of mind to pick up anything in it. In any case, they would be in the process of suffering substantial wage cuts in that period and would be even less interested in seeing any of their resources going into superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entirety of Opposition policy on wages is to secure, by one means or another, wage cuts and the removal of disposable income that will enable people to participate effectively in superannuation schemes. So the people out there should be aware of this from the debate: the Opposition will wreck their retirement and wreck the opportunity that there is in this country for a decent savings regime. That will come at the expense of business and will ultimately come at the expense of those who employ people in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992. In fact, this week is Disability Week, so it is perhaps an appropriate time to be debating this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall the words of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in May this year when he told the Parliament that the Disability Discrimination Bill represents a landmark in achieving human rights for all Australians. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has a long term commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time the Minister invited interested parties to make further comments on the legislation over the winter recess. Now, three months later, the Minister and his Bill are under fire from such respected groups as the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Association of Surgeons. Both associations have expressed concern about the expanded definition of the term `disability' and the rights of health professionals when dealing with HIV positive patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even groups representing people with disabilities have hit out at the Bill, labelling it as discriminatory and a mockery of the very essence of the reasons for the Bill. Letters and faxes expressing such concerns have poured into the office of my colleague the shadow Minister for Community Services, Senator Tambling. I know he has brought many of those views to the attention of the Minister's office. However, the Minister and his Government remain oblivious to the fundamental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal coalition has sought to obtain the names and addresses of people and groups who have made submissions to the Government. The Minister's office has refused to make available those details, leaving the Federal coalition with no alternative but to request the information via questions on notice. For these reasons, the Federal coalition believes it is necessary to refer this Bill to a joint select committee to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny. Accordingly, I therefore move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be referred to a Joint Select Committee, to be known as the Joint Select Committee on the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992, to be appointed to inquire into and report by 3 November 1992 on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)a general assessment of the outcomes of the proposed legislation in relation both to persons with disabilities and others in the community, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the appropriateness of exemptions included in the Bill, particularly for the telecommunications industry and the deaf community and whether further exemptions should be included, for example, for the Australian Defence Force;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)whether the Bill deals satisfactorily with significant issues of health policy and whether these could be dealt with more appropriately in separate legislation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the appropriateness of the definition of `disability', including an examination of existing definitions of disability in the UN Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons and/or State legislation, the reasons why the proposed definition is different and whether it should include, for example, cognitive and neurological dysfunctions; </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)the need to clarify provisions relating to `unjustifiable hardship' and `action plans';</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)the interrelationship of the legislation with existing legislative provisions such as the `compulsory conference' procedure and the procedures in existing racial and sex discrimination legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)whether the mechanisms contained in the Bill are the most appropriate means of reducing disadvantages experienced by people with disabilities, including a detailed examination of the costs of the proposed legislation to industry and taxpayers and of the practicalities of its implementation".</PARA>
<PARA>Various peak bodies have made representations to the shadow Minister for community services. I believe they are the tip of the iceberg in relation to concerns about the Bill's proposed outcomes and mechanisms. For example, the Confederation of Australian Industry strongly opposed the legislation, saying that employment decisions should be taken on the ground of merit. The Head Injury Council of Australia wanted the definition of `disability' to include `cognitive and neurological dysfunction', in line with recent Queensland Government legislation. The Law Institute of Victoria questioned why the burden of proof in disproving the exception of `unjustifiable hardship' rested with the complainant. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria highlighted the ambiguity of `unjustifiable hardship' and the lack of `action plan' monitoring. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills found that the legislation failed to set out the qualities and attributes needed for a person appointed to preside over a compulsory conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reading the representations, a common concern relates to exemptions and, in particular, the proposed three-year exemption for the telecommunications industry. The Royal South Australian Deaf Society went as far as describing the Bill as `discriminatory and, as such, not acceptable to the deaf community'. According to the Bill, the term `disability' covers physical, sensory, intellectual and psychiatric impairment, mental illness or disorder and the presence in the body of organisms causing or capable of causing disease. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new and broader definition attracted a barrage of criticism. The Australian Medical Association rightly pointed out that virtually all Australians carried organisms in their bodies capable of causing disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to protect personal or private health was also raised by the AMA submission, as well as the need for a special exemption to cover the health professions. Similarly, the Australian Association of Surgeons expressed concern that the Bill would make it illegal for a surgeon to refuse to perform an elective procedure on a known HIV positive patient.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While acknowledging that the Bill was laudable in concept, the Association felt that its implications had not been thought through, particularly in regard to the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important to reflect on the principles of the Bill. The legislation is complaints based and provides for the establishment of an office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, who will be part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commissioner will try to conciliate complaints but, where the process is unsuccessful, the Commission can inquire into complaints and make determinations. The determinations, which are not binding on the parties but are enforceable in the Federal Court, include remedial action and the payment of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation specifies that damages can cover injury to a complainant's feelings or the humiliation that the person might suffer. The Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, highlighted this point when he referred to the case of a Tasmanian footballer banned from playing because he was HIV positive. Speaking on ABC radio on 17 July, he said that the footballer could soon have recourse to new anti-discrimination law and demand compensation from the local league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that only reasonable accommodation needs to be made for people with disabilities. Persons against whom complaints are made can argue that the accommodation necessary involves unjustifiable hardship. Similarly, an employer can argue that a person with a disability is unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the introduction of disability standards should the Government and relevant parties decide they are necessary. The standards relate to employment, education, accommodation, provision of public transport services and facilities, and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. Service providers also have an opportunity to lodge action plans with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission outlining long term strategies to overcome perceived discriminatory practices. The legislation exempts charities, telecommunications for three years, pensions and allowances, migration, combat duties and peacekeeping services by the Australian defence forces, and peacekeeping services by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may also grant temporary exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, this Bill defined `defacto spouse' as a person living with another person:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married. . . whether or not they are of the same sex.</PARA>
<PARA>The definition broke new ground because it extended the definition of `defacto spouse' to homosexual couples for the first time. Last week the Minister circulated draft amendments deleting the words `defacto spouse' and defining `associate' as a spouse, a person living with another person on a genuine domestic basis, relative, carer, or a person in a business, sporting or recreational relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition are concerned that these and other definitional changes, as set out in last week's draft amendments, are the only issues to have been addressed by the Minister. Indeed if these amendments were meant to clarify the scope of the Bill, they have failed. Instead we have been presented with further uncertainty&mdash;just what is a `recreational relationship'? Who will be held to be a `carer'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objects of the Disability Discrimination Bill are, of course, highly commendable. In his second reading speech, the Minister said that the legislation was an effective means of overcoming the most significant barrier facing people with disabilities in this country&mdash;the attitudinal barrier. I believe the Bill in its present form will not overcome that barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge honourable members to support the coalition's amendments to ensure that proper parliamentary scrutiny complements the many submissions by interested parties. If a joint parliamentary select committee is not agreed to by the Minister in the House, I would certainly place the Government on notice that the coalition will have no alternative but to pursue that action through a Senate inquiry because we have many unresolved concerns. In this case it would be a great pity that members of the House of Representatives would therefore be denied participation in this important parliamentary review. I reiterate our determination to ensure that people with disabilities in Australia are not discriminated against. I urge the Government to accept our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill, and specifically to address the Disability Discrimination Bill. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), will be addressing the concerns raised by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) for the Opposition. But, in passing, I comment that Opposition amendment (1)(c) labours under a misapprehension because the Bill which is before the House does indeed have a wide enough definition to include the range of disability against which people are required not to discriminate. Certainly cognitive and neurological dysfunctions cannot be separated from intellectual disability, which is at the very centre of the legislation which our Government has been building for a number of years. I also trust that the `detailed examination of the costs of the proposed legislation to industry and taxpayers' will not provide another discriminatory block to the application of proper and decent standards for people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill represents a high point of achievement in the Government's endeavours since 1983 to promote rights for people with disabilities. As the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons draws to a close, and in this particular week, Disability Week, it is timely that we should consider our achievements in Australia over the decade as a basis for our plans for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government's assault on the joint bastions of fear and ignorance&mdash;ingredients of prejudice&mdash;which shut off people with disabilities and their carers from the flow of life for so many years is now an important part of Australia's social history. Indeed, this Government's introduction of life-changing reforms has had far-reaching consequences for people with disabilities and for their carers. For a growing number of people with disabilities&mdash;certainly not all but those dependent on need&mdash;there is no longer the need to be confined to institutions, unable to make decisions about the way they wish to live, and segregated from the rest of society. The changes needed to effect this broadening of opportunities&mdash;and such changes unavoidably bring a measure of dislocation and concern&mdash;were not undertaken without serious planning and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the Labor Government strengthened the voice of people with disabilities by establishing the Disability Advisory Council of Australia to provide direct advice to the Federal Government in this area. A comprehensive review of programs and services for people with disabilities was undertaken&mdash;the handicapped programs review. This set the scene for a series of widespread reforms. The report of the handicapped programs review, published in 1985, recommended new legislation. As a consequence, the Government introduced the Disability Services Act in 1986. This Act stated that services for people with disabilities should be provided in accordance with the kind of fundamental rights that the rest of us take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act marked a move towards smaller services focused on the needs of individuals. It initiated a move away from institutional solutions towards community-based options and it sought to facilitate access to mainstream services. It provided for a wider range of service options and encouraged innovation in service delivery. In introducing and implementing this Act, the Government gave a clear response to people with disabilities. It said, `We hear what you are saying and we are doing something about it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government was not prepared to sit back and rest on its laurels. It recognised, and continues to recognise, that, while the Disability Services Act marked a turning point, it was only the beginning and much more still needed to be done. In 1988 we established a social security review to address key issues for the reform of income support provisions for people with disabilities. As a result, a major reform of income support and related labour market programs was announced in the 1990 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability reform package aims to improve the participation of people with disabilities in employment, education and training activities; to make it easier for people with disabilities to participate in and contribute to the life and work of the community; and to make sure that people who have severe disabilities and limited job prospects get adequate and secure income support. It is unique in that it brings together the major agencies responsible for support services, education and training, employment and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the disability reform package the Government signalled that people with disabilities could no longer be cast outside the employment mainstream of this country. The disability reform package also highlighted the importance of agencies working together rather than in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar spirit of cooperation, the Commonwealth has sought to work together with State and Territory governments to maximise resource use and minimise duplication in order to provide high quality services for people with disabilities. In 1991 the Commonwealth-State disability agreement was signed. Under this agreement the Commonwealth Government will administer employment services for people with disabilities, while State governments administer all accommodation and other support services. In yesterday's Budget $114.3m was set aside to assist the States in this transition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since July 1991, Queensland&mdash;my home State&mdash;Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory have enacted the necessary complementary legislation to the Commonwealth DSA. The agreement was implemented in those four States on 1 July of this year. Today we are debating the next cog in the social justice mechanism for people with disabilities: legislation which recognises the rights of people with a disability as amongst those basic but crucially important human rights which have been enshrined in legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Bills before the House. It is this type of legislation which makes the difference between those societies which are enlightened and those which are not. People are still subject to discrimination purely on the basis of disability&mdash;discrimination which is socially damaging and morally unacceptable and which costs the whole community. Above all, this discrimination is hurting individual people who are contributing to our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill provides the framework for eliminating discrimination which prevents fair access for people with a disability to jobs, education, sport and entertainment, and provides an effective means of overcoming perhaps the most significant barrier that people with a disability face&mdash;the attitudinal barrier. The key features of this legislation include establishing a Disability Discrimination Commissioner who will be required to investigate and conciliate complaints of discrimination on the ground of disability. It is a complaints based system, broadly styled on the existing anti-discrimination legislation which is now familiar within the community at large. Under the legislation the disability is defined as covering not only the mental and physical disabilities&mdash;and this would include cognitive and neurological dysfunction&mdash;but also those related to drug and alcohol overuse, addiction and the presence of organisms such as the HIV-AIDS virus. It also defines just what is unfair discrimination and helps the community to understand that ensuring equal treatment for people with disabilities may require some adjustment on their part. While mediation and conciliation are the main emphases of the Bill, it does make provision, as with other anti-discrimination Acts, for judicial proceedings as a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But underpinning the legislation is the potential for it to influence that factor which is most fundamental to the overall success of disability reform&mdash;the changing of attitude. The Act will have two major functions. It will provide a standard for Australia in attitude toward and treatment of people with disabilities, and it will be an educative mechanism to mould a proper attitude towards people with disabilities and their carers. As a standard, it will declare that the Australian society believes that people with disabilities have the right to public recognition of their qualities as individuals, to a respect for their contribution to society and their abilities, to the opportunities for a full citizenship offered to other Australians, and that we believe it strongly enough to legislate for it. It makes a statement that no person shall suffer discrimination when seeking a job, choosing a home, or planning a career. It sets up an expectation that Australians will act decently toward a person with a disability and a requirement by law that they do so. But of equal importance, in the tradition of legislation such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, it will formulate attitude by educating people, and providing a basis of information necessary to dissolve stigma borne mainly because of a lack of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a public argument which emerges regularly stating that one cannot legislate against attitude. I have heard this many times in many different instances, but I disagree with it. When I was involved in the random breath testing campaign, I was told that one cannot legislate against social drinking. During the debate on affirmative action for women, I was told that one cannot legislate to provide such activity and understanding; one would just have to wait for things to evolve naturally. Now we have an instance where many women, instead of occupying the servile position in business and other organisations, are in a proper managerial role. Smoking in public places is still controversial, but a growing number of people are now demanding a smoke-free environment in areas such as restaurants following the debate on the need to regulate the effect of passive smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most if not all people with disabilities and their carers have felt the barbs of stigma. I will give four of many instances of everyday discrimination. One is the case of a carer taking out a child with slow intellectual development and being judged not only by people who stare at the unusual but by people who are thinking that a child of that physical age must be naughty for behaving at an intellectual level which is inappropriate to that child. Another instance is when people are out in public areas with mobility aids, maybe aids which are unusual. The same sort of discrimination occurs. The stigma or effects of stigma are applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman within my area who has an adult son in a nursing home told me a story which typified another type of discrimination. There are two aspects to it. Her adult son is in a nursing home and he has the natural curiosity of a child. She is continually having to contend with his being judged as an adult male who pervs. Not only people of his age but younger people with disabilities are put into nursing homes. That is one area where we want and need a wider number of options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A community worker was telling me that his group, based on caring for the community, felt very awkward in the presence of an adult with an intellectual disability. Everything would be going along fine until this person would come in when silence would occur. This was given to me as an argument against integration by a person for whom for some time I had had great respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prime instance of bureaucratic discrimination is that experienced by a mother, whom I will call Joanne, who has a 17-year-old daughter, whom I will call Brenda, who has an intellectual disability, slow development. In her early childhood Brenda was actually denied hormone treatment to rectify a known condition that would make her much shorter than average through her entire life. She missed out because it was deemed that so-called normal kids would gain more from that program. So Brenda reaches childhood not only coping with intellectual disability, but also her feeling of being physically different from the other people with whom she mixes. You would not credit it in Australia in these recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is the system of educational apartheid which must shoulder a fair portion of the blame for a lack of understanding of people with disabilities. To counter this, I advocate the integration of people with disabilities into mainstream education. I know all of the arguments that are put towards deferring this. I am a trained teacher. I understand that teachers need resources. I understand that sometimes segregation for development within special schools is advantageous to the child. But I also understand that there is nothing which will develop, as in this case, a child with intellectual disability more than to be out in the mainstream. Such children bound ahead when they are integrated at preschool level because they have role models and because they are stimulated. It can do so much for a child with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, this discrimination, I believe, is in part because we are all part of generations which did not understand the abilities and the individual qualities and personalities of people with disabilities because they were not in our schools. That is why there is fear. That is why there is lack of understanding. That is why there is stigma; that is why there is discrimination; and that is why a Bill such as this is very necessary. It is necessary to stimulate debate, to set a standard, to get people talking about the need to give the same options and opportunities to people with disabilities as other citizens are enjoying in Australia. Most particularly, it is necessary to understand that there is a large and mostly silent grouping&mdash;it has been silent in the past&mdash;of citizens of Australia who are not getting the same sorts of opportunities as they themselves would expect for their own families, and in part this is because of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before closing, I would like to take a moment to praise the dedication and humanity of the many thousands of people who spend their lives caring for people with a disability and to welcome the announcements in last night's Budget, which is looking specifically to the needs of those people. I really appreciate all that has been done by those appropriate Ministers and would like to congratulate the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services for his continued commitment to broadening the horizons for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of a Bill such as this is that it sets up a point of public debate which will educate a large and growing number of people to support and appreciate people with disabilities. There are organisations and people who have done so over the decades, but now we have people coming out of schemes such as the Disability Services Act transition scheme. There was a lot of natural fear regarding the introduction of something new, but a statement had to be made that is loud, clear and definitive and in the interests of people with disabilities who will be advantaged by these Bills if they are, in fact, to take their rightful place in society.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Disability Discrimination Bill concerns a topic which is of deep concern to all Australians&mdash;that there are people who live within our community who have disabilities. Many of us are aware of circumstances where people with disabilities have been discriminated against quite unfairly and unacceptably in our society. The Bill before us is important. The position that we, as an Opposition, are adopting in asking for a full and thorough analysis of and debate on this issue is only going to back up what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), said, which is that this is an important issue and, if it is about attitudinal change, the more vigorous and wide-ranging the debate is in regard to leaders in this nation of ours on this topic, the more people will be alerted to the issues involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discrimination and disability are complex areas in their own right for the community generally and for members of the Parliament. When we talk about attitudinal change, we must realise that it does not occur by the passing of legislation in the Parliament&mdash;it is helped by it&mdash;but by convincing people out there that the leaders of the nation have given due consideration to it; that they have analysed it carefully and fully and that they appreciate the logic and rationality of the debate. From that comes a mainstream change in thinking in the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider the subject of discrimination, we find that quite often as things are changed in society and we say that we are taking away discrimination against certain groups, we start to discriminate against other people. I highlight to the Parliament, and to anybody else who may read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>record of this debate later on, that for the first time in this nation a government has brought into this Parliament the equating of homosexual relationships with marriage; it is the first time in our history that a government has tried to put exactly the same legal and responsible status on a homosexual relationship as there is on a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say to everybody who is either listening to this debate or who may even read these speeches that we in this place have to decide what is good for Australia as to whether we promote family life or whether we equally promote homosexual relationships. Fortunately, the Government saw good sense and withdrew that definition. But it does signify the attitude of the present Government to family matters that it is willing to equate those relationships with that of marriage. I think that is unsatisfactory. I do not believe that is the way to build a better society in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Government on amending the legislation and taking that definition out. But it would not have happened without lobbying by the Opposition. The Government would have brought that in and would have believed that it was going to create a better society by so doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discrimination is not an easy topic to debate. Therefore, let us examine this legislation. We are saying that we are dealing with discrimination and trying to eliminate it, but this Bill is inconsistent. I say that because it exempts certain groups. Is that or is that not discriminatory? Of course it is discriminatory if Telecom, charities, pensions, allowances, migration and combat duties are not covered by this legislation. It is not a straightforward issue. The legislation claims to be aimed at doing away with discrimination or minimising discrimination in respect of people with disabilities. However, the legislation is internally inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Commission, which would oversee this legislation, could do three things. It could conciliate, it could inquire about a particular issue which is brought before it, and it could make determinations. Let us look at the types of determinations that it can make. It can make a determination for remedial action&mdash;that is, something which might be able to smooth over the circumstances and sort out the issue without any particular difficulty. I would agree with that. Compensation may have to be paid or dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get down to the real nitty-gritty as to how this will operate. This area of legislating is very complex and we need to fully debate and understand it. Compensation by the Human Rights Commissioner is made in regard to complaints involving feelings or humiliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What criteria will we give for compensation? What will be the qualities of the people involved which will ensure that, in their assessments and judgments of making compensations in regard to people's feelings, they will not be discriminatory? How can we achieve this at the nitty-gritty level? Can it be legislated for? Let us treat those people with disabilities fairly and in a caring, compassionate way, but let us recognise that it is extremely difficult to legislate fairly in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put a question to those present. If one had to make a judgment about feelings and complaints or whether there had been humiliation, what criteria would one use? I am sure that there would be some prejudices flowing from each person's experiences of life. How do we ensure that this legislation, if passed in its present form, will do the things that we want it to do? The position is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we have people assessing the almost unassessable things such as feelings and humiliation, but the Bill also provides for things like reasonable accommodation needs. Who determines what is reasonable? Is there a community standard as to what reasonable accommodation is? Is reasonable accommodation in northern Australia the same as in southern Australia? There is a great diversity. If we are going to put into place legislation that addresses these things, we will have to have a lot more clarity than is provided by generalised terms such as `reasonable accommodation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have employers being able to talk about inherent requirements of the job. What determines `inherent requirements'? How do we define these things? This is a very complex area in regard to being able to bring about the attitudinal changes that are required. In many ways, unfortunately, we as a Parliament are trying to do something which should have been instilled in all of us as we grew up&mdash;to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. If we actually believed in that as a nation&mdash;all of us as individuals&mdash;this legislation would be totally irrelevant and unnecessary. The failure in Australia today is that the attitudes which are needed are not being inculcated into our young people as they grow up. It is probably not possible in many of our homes, where families are breaking up. But here we have circumstances where we are trying to legislate back for a very old edict. If we had all obeyed and followed that edict diligently, we would not be faced with this legislation. What we are trying to do is a very complex task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the definition of `disability'. We find in the definition provided in the legislation that we in Australia are now becoming much more wide-ranging than even the conventions. We want to expand the definition. I say as a side comment that it is interesting that we have our Prime Minister saying that he wants to throw off all the shackles that have anything to do with our heritage, our origin with the United Kingdom, the Queen, the flag, et cetera, but at the same time saying, `Let us all bow and kiss the ground to any United Nations convention'. We ought to be able to stand in our own right. Here we have this sort of duplicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us forget about that and let us keep to the actual definition of `disability'. The Government wants to expand it so that it covers diseases that people may have or organisms which lead to diseases within the body. The interesting thing about that is that it is not just for the disorder that might occur now; it is also for the future. This expansion of the definition of `disability' needs far more discussion in this Parliament than it has ever been given credit for by the Government. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) raised the incident of the Tasmanian footballer. That was the subject of a discussion with Ellen Fanning and Brian Burdekin. Is infection with AIDS a disability?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have rights on one hand and no responsibilities on the other.

If this legislation goes through and the views of Mr Burdekin are proved to be correct, then I think we will saddle our society with an unacceptable burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much support our amendment to the legislation. I believe it is very important that we debate this issue and that we discuss it fully. I say to the Parliament again that if we do want to bring about genuine attitudinal changes, it will take time. This process needs to be undertaken in the community and I believe a committee of the Senate would fully explore this issue. That is what should happen if we are to bring about wholesome attitudinal changes. There is a great need for us to bring about those changes in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the illustrations presented to the House by the honourable member for Lilley are compelling. I have spent time with people with disabilities; I have looked after them and cared for them, particularly when I was in high school. In my work with them I very much enjoyed their personalities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has said that this is a very complex issue. There are complexities, but my Labor colleagues and I believe that this legislation embraces the very simple premise that people, irrespective of who or what they are, should be treated equally and with dignity. I think that is what we all should be striving for. We have all heard tales about the end of society as we know it. Labor members are working to change society as it is now, as it is not the kind of society that we would want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a process that happened about 10 years ago when some children in my electorate who were in wheelchairs wanted entry into the local high school. Many parents and a range of people in the community complained, but I am pleased to say that the process went ahead. It was not a question of time but of action. To suggest that children who are confined to wheelchairs or who need the aid of various other mobility processes and so on should not be part of that high school would now be looked upon as outrageous and poor behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to change attitudes in many ways is action&mdash;not talking. We all know what society is like now. All of us can stand here and talk and look at the way society is, but now it is time for action and change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has at its heart a very simple premise. It is, in fact, very much part of Labor policy. We are committed to a fair and just society, irrespective of who we are or where we are. We believe it is part of the Government's role and responsibility to provide leadership in this area, and so it is that we bring this legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at last night's Budget, we can see something of that very heart of Labor which is in all of this. It is about quality of life for all Australians; not for some&mdash;not those people who happen to have various attributes and not others&mdash;but for all Australians. Every person has the right of access to opportunities and services. That is very much what is at the heart of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No amount of Senate committees, discussion and talk is going to change that. It is simply a held belief that, irrespective of who we are, where we are or where we live, we should be treated with dignity and have the right to access opportunities and services. Unfortunately, for that to happen in our society we need to enshrine it in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps in an ideal world, as the honourable member for Braddon suggests, we should all think, believe and hope that this will occur. Our European society has been here for almost 200 years and to date it has not happened. People have talked about it, people have talked against it, but it has not happened. Now is the time for action and for the Government to take a role in leadership. It is this commitment to a fair and just society which perhaps best delineates ourselves and those people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the experiences of people with disabilities, we become increasingly aware of the need for a disability discrimination Bill. We heard what the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) said. We have also seen that, within our society, there is not full acceptance of people with disabilities. Changing one's attitude is fundamental to the overall success of disability reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a whole range of examples that we could all cite, but at the heart of the matter is something which I&mdash;and members of this House perhaps know this&mdash;have discussed for some time, and that is people's right to work. I find it not immoral but amoral that it is considered all right; that it is considered de rigueur that people with disabilities should actually pay $50 a fortnight to go to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various people in the community suggest that that is totally acceptable. In fact, I was told it is not even illegal. I do not care whether it is illegal. I say simply that it is wrong; nobody pays $50 a fortnight to work in Woolies and pack shelves. No member of the Parliament pays $50 a fortnight to work in here. Why then is it somehow acceptable for people with disabilities to pay $50 a fortnight to go to work? Indeed, it is not. It is because of those attitudes&mdash;allowing people to be treated differently because of different kinds of abilities&mdash;that we need legislation such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I acknowledge that this legislation may not change attitudes, it is one small step towards realising that kind of change. As I have said before, the time for talking is gone. What we want is action. This legislation will challenge discriminatory attitudes and will encourage people to be more aware of the abilities of people with disabilities. I am reminded of when I was in the classroom way back in 1974 when children with special needs were integrated into our school. The change in attitudes which occurred there was quite dramatic. It was not because people spent time on committees talking about doing things&mdash;what may or may not be done&mdash;it was the result of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see now is a vision; we have not achieved it. There are plenty of people with disabilities who do not have the opportunities they deserve or the services that they could ideally benefit from in order to participate more fully in our society. No-one is more aware of that than I am as we struggle to provide a range of different kinds of services. But the Disability Discrimination Bill is a vital step in the Government's continuing commitment to people with disabilities. It builds on the decade of reform. It has been a decade in which we have seen significant changes in Australia's social security, health, housing, education, industrial relations and taxation systems as well as disability services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon asks what kinds of standards people want in housing. I remind him that people, irrespective of who they are, just want to be able to choose when they get up and when they go to bed. I do not think that is too much to ask in Australia in the 1990s. There are people in our community who do not have that choice. The honourable member is totally unaware of the kinds of conditions in which many people live. If we are to confront the fundamental causes of disadvantage in Australia and break down the barriers that stop some groups from participating fully in Australian society, we have to confront the cause. In ensuring that all Australians are able to exercise their rights, we must ensure that they have a right to act freely and to determine the shape of their lives. Very many people with disabilities do not have an opportunity to determine the shape of their lives. Our policies are based on the principle that all Australians have a right to a quality of life which includes choices and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of our demonstrated commitment to this, our achievements for people with disabilities have been unsurpassed. We have achieved considerably, but there is still a long way to go. The introduction of the Disability Services Act, and with it those innovations, has had the support of a whole range of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building process and additional initiatives which were announced in the Budget last night also looked to address issues of concern to people with disabilities and their carers: the increase in the mobility allowance by $5 a week, and the establishment of the Transport Advisory Committee to improve access to public and private transport. We have only to look in the public galleries to recognise that people in wheelchairs cannot come into our Parliament and listen to what we have to say. If we are talking about choices and questions of opportunities, right here in this House is an example of the way in which Australian society has failed to address the needs of access. The Opposition can set up all the Senate committees it likes but it will not change the stairs to the gallery for people who may want to come here to hear what we have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment entry payment for people with disabilities entering the work force has increased to $300 from $100. Often we find that people who have particular needs need some extra financial assistance to enable them to make a transition to work. As well as that, the education entry payment of $200 a year will also be payable to disability support pensioners. That entry payment for education is paid to a number of other people in our community for whom the cost of entering education can become a barrier because of their period on benefits. Why should we not treat everybody in the same sort of equal way? We have also heard discussions about the Deaf Society and various other groups which are lobbying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for his question. The Budget last night, as I indicated last night, was really a Budget about jobs now and jobs in the future. It responds to the fact that there are regions of unemployment in Australia which simply cannot be ignored in the way in which the Opposition would have us ignore them. Indeed, far from not ignoring them, the Opposition Leader says that he will take 2 per cent out of the economy by reducing the Budget deficit to something like $6 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we have here the starkest comparison of all between the two parties. We, on the one hand, are sensibly responding to the circumstances being confronted by Australian communities. We are providing help to those communities where those people live. On the other hand, the Opposition wants to exacerbate the unemployment situation by actually taking out of the economy something like $6 billion or $7 billion by reducing the Budget deficit. Not only does it want to cancel the fiscal stimulus; it actually wants to work against the normal stabilisers which respond through the Budget when the economy changes its rate of growth. This is one of the most heartless prescriptions which could ever have been proposed, and can be easily set against our approach&mdash;which is about responding sensibly, carefully and compassionately to those people who live in these regions of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Adelaide will be aware, we are particularly concerned about those regions which have higher than average unemployment and we are responding appropriately with the level of government closest to those people. We are responding in an appropriate way to provide the jobs for them as we improve the facilities in those communities in which they live. But we have not taken our eyes off the longer term goal of making this a vibrant and successful trading nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Opposition might believe that it can have some magical response from some $40 billion switch in taxation in Australia, that somehow that will magically create a more competitive nation in Australia, that is not the way to do it. The way is through hard work, by engaging all Australian working men and women, whether they are employees or employers, in the task of making their businesses, their places of work, more competitive, more productive and, therefore, able to make a greater contribution to the nation's wealth. This Budget is very much concentrated on continuing that process of economic and social transformation which will make this country that vibrant and successful nation.</PARA>

Somehow there is a perception about now that all the Government should be doing is either producing negative outlays growth or zero outlays growth in a country which has got quite substantial population growth and where, in the natural course of the cycle, it is entirely appropriate to be running outlays growth levels at around these sorts of levels, around 4 per cent real at this stage of the cycle.</PARA>

Now that the figure has risen back to $2 1/2 billion because the Reserve Bank has been selling foreign exchange and making a profit in the market, what should it do?  Should it make a profit and not remit it to the Government, or if it does remit the profit to the Government should we say, `Let's keep that a dark secret.'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The increases in pension rates announced in the Budget last night were intended to maintain this Government's historic commitment to maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We will be doing that by bringing the March indexation forward to January and providing an additional real increase of $2 per fortnight for singles and $3.30 for couples. That will also flow on to DVA pensioners and some 300,000 allowees. I admit that that is a modest real increase, but it is appropriate in the budgetary circumstances facing the Government. It is important to remember that it comes on top of a 13.7 per cent real increase in pensions over the lifetime of this Government. That is the first of these proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we contrast that with what the Opposition has done, which we need to do constantly in these matters simply to remind the public of what it offers, we see that its previous spokesman for social security, Senator Alston&mdash;I note that such spokesmen are recycled quite regularly&mdash;only five months ago said this about what we have just done:</PARA>

Those pensioners in greatest need&mdash;that is, those with no other income, renting privately&mdash;could gain up to $11.50 a week out of the Budget changes to both the rate increase and the rent assistance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Budget program in relation to pensioners, at the same time as protecting those pensioners with little or no other income than the pension, we have also sought to maximise the encouragement to pensioners to maximise private income. What we have done is to abolish the income and assets test for fringe benefits on all part pensioners. So from 1 April next year anyone getting a part pension will get the full range of Commonwealth concessions. That, again, is designed to encourage people during their working lives to make these savings to supplement the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the package of measures announced last night we continued to refine the targeting of payments through changes to treatment of investments for social security purposes. Briefly, we are doing three main things. We are going to use the real and not the deemed rate of accrual for market limited investments&mdash;an issue which has been pressed upon us by the representatives of people in that area. We will treat shares in the same way as we treat all other investments, therefore closing an obvious loophole which has been exploited in the system. We will treat voluntarily preserved superannuation and rollover arrangements in exactly the same way as compulsorily preserved superannuation. This means that if a person in his or her fifties becomes unemployed or is in need of sickness benefit and only has voluntary superannuation, not compulsorily preserved superannuation, he or she will be able to get immediate access to social security benefits without expending that superannuation. Therefore, we are giving them equal treatment to those who have compulsorily preserved superannuation.</PARA>

So if they wish to make adjustments to their investment arrangements, they are free to do so. It will not come into effect until September 1993. I point out that over half of those 85,000 will be amongst those who benefit from the extension of fringe benefits to all part pensioners.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="165" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard claims this morning by, for example, the honourable member for Lowe, who was parroting, no doubt, statements of his mentor, Bruce Shepherd. One thing one ought to understand about Dr Shepherd is that it is a decade since he has been anywhere near the public hospital system and his comments usually reflect the fact that he is increasingly ignorant of that system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that this Budget includes the most comprehensive structural changes in health care in Australia's history. The key to that reform is to guarantee access to hospital on the basis of clinical need, not insurance status. We will do this through an integrated five-point strategy. Firstly, we will restructure Federal-State finances and invest $1.23 billion over five years to end discrimination against public patients. Admission to public hospitals will be on the basis of medical need, not insurance status. Secondly, we will immediately invest $70m in areas where long waiting times for surgery exists in a targeted waiting list program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we will restructure the management of waiting lists to ensure that they are managed fairly and accurately and for the first time we will collect and publish national data on waiting lists and times through the Australian Institute of Health. Fourthly, we will establish a Medicare patient charter as part of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation to define people's entitlements under Medicare. Fifthly, we will establish effective complaints mechanisms for patients, including the development of an 008 patient hotline to provide patients and referring doctors with accurate information on where patients can be treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the honourable member's question, we need to understand that the Medicare system&mdash;established by this Government and, I think, recognised by the Australian people as the first stable universal health insurance system that we have had in this country&mdash;is essentially designed to provide that equity as a matter of right, as a matter of entitlement. Medicare does not simply belong to the Commonwealth;  it belongs to all Australian people. People have the right to understand their entitlements and to have their entitlements guaranteed by the States in terms of the administration of the hospital system. So when the Commonwealth makes grants to the States, it expects there to be an entitlement as far as public patients are concerned&mdash;for public patients to have access to hospital systems, not on the basis of their financial status, not on the basis of their insurance status, but on the basis of their clinical need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to ensure that that entitlement effectively is translated into reality and that discrimination is ended. We ask no more than that people's entitlements be recognised as a matter of right. In terms of the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, we will be seeking to achieve what we have already achieved, for example in relation to the Commonwealth-State disability agreement. Under that agreement we asked the States essentially to legislate to ensure that their approach to disability was in line with the path-breaking Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, what we are going to do is require the States to reciprocally legislate so that the principles of Medicare are enshrined not only in Commonwealth legislation but also in State legislation around the country. What that means is that Commonwealth legislation will become national legislation. Entitlements that have been there will be made more explicit and discrimination will be ended. So it will be entirely appropriate that we put in place a charter of people's entitlements and rights, so that people understand where they have access to the public hospital system without charge, to the best quality system that Australia can provide, and comparable to the best system in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has suited the Opposition from time to time to denigrate the Australian health system. It suited those opposite to suggest that there is no cap in relation to costs. The honourable member for Lowe says, `If we need to throw more money at it, let us do it'. It suited the Opposition to effectively dismantle Medicare again and to replace it with private insurance in which each additional dollar that would be offered by the Opposition would be taken out of the public hospital system.</PARA>

It is something that belongs to the Australian people and we intend to ensure that in terms of the Medicare agreement we reaffirm our faith in the public hospital system in this country, that we build on that very good system in terms of structural change and reform, that we provide proper financial support and that the incentives are right so that people's entitlements under Medicare are absolutely clear and so that people understand that under this Government they have security in terms of health because what we are about is not destroying Medicare but making Medicare that much stronger.</PARA>

Indeed, as I repeat, it is quite significant that the phones were ringing pretty hot in my office with Opposition members wanting more details and wanting to contact their local councils.

I refer you to the average time taken for questions and answers in the course of the last Question Time, excluding time out for points of order, which now exceeds some six minutes. I compare that with 1982 when the House averaged 2.9 minutes per question and answer. In 1976 it was 2.4 minutes per question and answer. I put it to you, sir, that part of your responsibility is to ensure fair play and efficient and effective operation of the House within the Standing Orders. I put it to you further that relevant to that is standing order 145 and also the length of answers of Ministers to questions. In those circumstances, in the interests of fair play, I ask: are you concerned about the lack of numbers of questions in Question Time and the length of answers? Do you have a comment to make with regard to the Standing Orders in the circumstance?

The Standing Orders have a lot to say about what questions are. They do not have much to say about what answers are. Oppositions of all political calibre complain about the Standing Orders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises this matter of public importance today to debate and to analyse the Budget which was brought down by the Government last night. It is a very disappointing Budget and the criticisms of the Budget which we see in this morning's press sum up very well the disappointment that so many people would feel in it. As the public look to the Government to provide some answers to the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) engineered, they would find very little in this Budget that would give them any sense of cheer for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote a few of the headlines: the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph-Mirror</EMPHASIS> describes the Budget as `Labor's $1b job gamble'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> states, `Dawkins gambles on jobs; a gamble again'; and the theme in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is `Keating's gamble'. I must say that there is not a bad cartoon next to it which picks up the political direction of this Budget. It has a shot of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) sitting at a table. He is speaking into a microphone saying that this Budget is all about jobs, jobs and jobs. Then there is a second shot of the same Mr Dawkins, at the same table, with the same microphone and he is saying, `Paul's job. This Budget is about Paul's job, it is about John's job, it is about Kim's job'. Unfortunately, that is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is not about real jobs. This Budget is about jobs for members of the Labor Party&mdash;the Labor politicians who want to see themselves re-elected at the next election. This Budget shows us that the Labor politicians are prepared to do and say anything to save their own political hides as we go into the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a very disappointing Budget because the Government had an opportunity to use it as a platform for some major changes which would really give people a chance of hope, but it has simply gone for its own political benefit. It is a disappointment that this is the best the Government could do after 10 years with nearly one million people unemployed and the worst recession for 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is not, I must say, the Government's first attempt. Over the last 12 months we have had five major economic statements. Every one of them starts with the prospect of jobs, finishes with the prospect of jobs and ends up delivering nothing; nothing but spending money the Government does not have to convince people that it is trying to do something. If one looks at the jobs proposals in this vote-buying Budget, one finds that the extent to which the Government has gone on a spending spree to satisfy the public that it is doing something is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take out the numbers, we see that the Government is spending $3 billion or $3 1/2 billion to achieve a one per cent reduction in the unemployment rate from 11 per cent to 10 per cent. Many of those so-called jobs are simply hiding people by transferring them from the unemployment queues to some training program. In some cases they might be painting white rocks for a council somewhere out the back of Woop Woop, but there are no real jobs. Any other jobs that are there will be temporary jobs only. The whole thing is an illusion on jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, in the Government's own forecast, it is effectively forced to admit that the impact on jobs over the next 12 months, through to June 1993, is minimal. It misses an opportunity to do something decent for jobs; it spends money simply as a very poor substitute. In respect of the Government's capacity to fund this Budget, we again see a massive blow-out in the Federal Budget deficit. It is $6 billion more than last year's deficit. The Government's spending in the Budget has gone up from about $102 billion to $111 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the five-year plan of the One Nation statement, we see a massive gaping hole in the finances of the Commonwealth Government. A figure of about 50 billion is the extent to which the Government will be short of a dollar through to 1995-96. Two of the promises the Government made only six months ago have literally evaporated&mdash;they have gone up in smoke. The proposition that the Government could return the Budget to a surplus in 1995-96 is not going to happen. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Budget which is artificially reducing jobs, not creating real jobs. We have a deficit that has blown out massively, and a government that is putting it all on the tick, on the plastic. One of the very interesting tables in the Federal Budget, when one goes through the fine detail, is one relating to contributions to real growth. It shows where the Government will be spending a lot more money in the years ahead. Guess where this money will be spent? It will go on the interest bill on the money it is borrowing&mdash;an extra $1.1 billion this year, which is an extra 26 per cent, and an extra $1.6 billion the year after, which is an extra 33 per cent. It is a massive explosion in the interest bill of the Commonwealth to meet the massive build-up in debt which the Government is using to fund this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government artificially reduces employment, blows away any semblance of fiscal responsibility it might ever have, and then mounts an attack on us by saying, `Members of the Opposition are ideologues, zealots, right wing, hard people who have no compassion'. I say to the Treasurer, `That is pretty rich coming from those people who made a million people unemployed'. The Treasurer boasted about his economic policy prowess and his capacity to run this economy. Yet we have the worst recession for 60 years. In this last Budget he did not have the decency to at least give people a plan and a fundamental set of reforms that would turn this economy around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer talks about compassion and attacks our proposals which he once advocated. He talks about jobs. If he looks at our Fightback package he will see a plan that will create jobs basically from day one. His Party used to be in favour of the abolition of payroll tax because he said that that would create up to 200,000 new jobs. Why did he not do it? Why did he not have the guts finally to do the right thing?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about older unemployed people who have been long term unemployed? If the Treasurer was really compassionate, he would have announced last night in his Budget a change to the industrial relations system to allow them to work in the manner outlined in our Austrain scheme.

Yes, we would have abolished payroll tax. Yes, we would have abolished other consumption taxes. We would have abolished the tax on exports. In fact, one of the vulnerabilities in the Government's Budget is the current account deficit forecast. I think $15 billion is a bit on the low side; $17 billion is more likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always worth looking at that statement in the Budget in which Treasury has had a say, because it always puts the qualification in. It can be found if one looks hard enough. Where was it? The qualification was that there is a downside risk to the Government's forecast, depending on the likely course of the overseas economies, particularly the Japanese. In fact, the Treasurer in his Budget Speech refers to the importance of the Japanese economy to Australia for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had delivered a Budget we would have gone much further on assets sales. The headline deficient figure would have been much lower&mdash;down to $6 billion or $7 billion. That would have been very beneficial for interest rates.

In this Budget there is virtually nothing for the business community, except the prospect of higher taxes&mdash;and in fact there are some higher taxes in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we need to develop an export strategy; a strategy to promote investment. We need a national savings strategy. We need, and should have had, a strategy to stabilise and reduce foreign debt.

It comes at a time when, instead of looking to the national interest and instead of producing a Budget that would hold out some hope of real jobs, this Government has gone on a vote-buying spending spree with money it does not have in order to look after its own political interests. I think the Treasurer will be damned by this. He will be damned for failing to take the opportunity to at last give this country a sense of hope. There is hope for this country; Australia is a good place. We have good potential if we are prepared to make the big decisions. Those big decisions await the return of a coalition government and the implementation of our alternative Budget: the Fightback Budget. </PARA>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a kind of tax fetishist; he has a total fetish for the tax system. Indeed, it was not until the last three minutes of his speech that he actually got off the subject of tax and onto something else.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last minute of his speech, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition finally got around to saying something positive about Australia. In speech after speech we have heard the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) simply harp on about all the perceived shortcomings of this nation. In speech after speech we hear Liberal Party and National Party of Australia politicians trying to run this country into the ground. As if this were not bad enough, they go to the point of undermining confidence in the currency by giving gratuitous advice to the money market and the foreign exchange market in a way which is calculated to extend or exaggerate volatility on those markets when it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action is entirely unbecoming to two people who purport to want to lead this nation. One does not lead this nation or offer advice to it by running it down; by constantly telling Australian workers how hopeless they are; by constantly telling Australian business how hopeless it is; or by constantly telling interest groups how they have only their own interests at heart, have no concept of a national interest and are not interested in participating in the development of a national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are entirely anti-Australian. Whilst they can wave their flags around&mdash;as they do constantly&mdash;that is just to cover up the fact that they have a basic insecurity and lack of confidence in this place and the people who work in it. They think they can cover up all of this by giving us this smokescreen in the form of a tax change which will in fact be counterproductive in trying to address Australia's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a total distraction right at a time when we are beginning to see the sorts of sensible changes, the helpful changes, which are coming about in the Australian economy. So I am not going to spend my time dwelling on tax issues. I am certainly not going to spend my time responding to the calculated scare tactics of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. However, I will talk on the question which he has put before the House and which he has quite deliberately avoided in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan that we have is a plan for today and it is a plan for tomorrow. In relation to today, what we have said is that we will attack the question of unemployment at its roots, in the local communities where the despair is deepest. Those communities are hurting most. For this we have been roundly abused by the Opposition on the basis that this is somehow just a vote-buying exercise. How could it possibly be a vote-buying exercise when we are responding to the anguished cries of people in those communities, some of whose members have been thrown out of work for the first time in their lives? We are trying to respond, not only by providing jobs for them in a sensible way, but also by trying to improve the amenity of the communities in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is only one feature. A wealth of additional programs designed to improve people's opportunities of getting back into work, by providing training opportunities for something like 430,000, are available. That is, nearly half of the unemployed can get access to a training place in the course of this year. Some of those training places involve work as well&mdash;work experience and real work. All the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can do is disparage this and say, `Why didn't you take up the Austrain idea?'. The people of Australia ought to understand that Austrain is about legalised slavery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition wants to do is compel the unemployed to take a cut in their wages of 20 or 30 per cent in order to get into some make-work scheme which would be provided in some way or other. They would be denied benefits, which would force them into this position of legalised slavery where they would actually have to take a cut of 20 to 30 per cent below the award rates in order to get work. There is no consideration of how many ordinary workers might be displaced as a result of this exercise, or how many people honestly going about their normal work might not be kicked out in order to make way for these `Aus-slave' victims who are forced upon various employers by this particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition abusing the unemployed, referring to them as couch potatoes, an expression which he picked up from his Leader. This is very reminiscent of the time when various Ministers for employment in the Fraser Government used to wander around this country referring to dole bludgers. There is no difference between a dole bludger and a couch potato in the Liberal Party's lexicon of abuse of the unemployed. It is just another way of blaming the victims for the problems that exist and for the circumstances in which they find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make matters worse, in the dying moments of his speech the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that what this Budget should really have been about was a deficit of $6 billion or $7 billion below what it was. In other words, not only does he eschew the idea that the Government ought to take action to provide a stimulus to a sluggishly growing economy, in order to spur a bit more life into it, in order to create a few more jobs this year and next, but also he believes we should withdraw billions from the economy and actually slow it down from the position it is now in and, of course, as a consequence take more jobs out of the economy. This is the breathtaking gall of honourable members opposite, that they will stand up here and actually confess to a policy which is about turning the economy back into recession, turning the economy down, and unemployment up. That is their view of what should have been an appropriate Budget for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of course our Budget was not only about the circumstances of today; it was about what we should do in preparing ourselves for a better tomorrow as well. If we look through the papers which were presented as part of the Budget, we find that there are pages and pages about the Government's plans&mdash;continuing plans. We did not have to dust off new tax schemes in order to explain where the country was moving in terms of becoming more internationally oriented and more capable of competing with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members look at Budget Paper No. 1, Budget Statement No. 2, part II, the section `Sustaining Growth', they will see that it goes from page 2.34 all the way up to page 2.64, so there are 30 pages of small print discussion about what we need to do in the future in order to get this country into a position where it can have sustainable growth. What this Government is about is growth:  growth sufficient to provide jobs for this country&mdash;not just now, but in the future as well. We do not baulk from the challenges we confront as we try to create that high level of growth.</PARA>

Exports are up and imports are up, because we are becoming an international trading nation. There is nothing wrong with having higher imports if they are balanced off with higher exports.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Federal Budget relies too much on faith, hope and charity, and is a disappointment to Australia's manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA>But it does not stop there. The Taxation Institute of Australia put out a media release headed `Tax system still a shambles, says Taxation Institute of Australia'. The Real Estate Institute of Australia, responding to the package that had something to do with housing, has a great quote. It really says it all. The Government tried to bring forward spending on housing by $75m in the vain hope that the mad scramble and panic might create jobs. I can tell the House what will happen if the Government brings forward spending in that area. The building industry has been plagued for years by peaks in funding; it falls off when the tap is turned off. Of course, you will waste money. I quote from the press release of the Real Estate Institute, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Minister Brian Howe is a major part of Australia's housing cost problem.</PARA>
<PARA>That is too darned true. It goes on to say that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is the problem in regard to housing costs in Australia. But of course it does not stop there. The Government's approach to this has been to create jobs that are not real jobs. I guess that is the really disappointing thing. At a time in Australia when we have one million people unemployed, we have an admission in this Budget that in 12 months time, mid-next year, we can still look forward to unemployment at 10 per cent. In four years time from today we will still have unemployment running at 8 per cent. That is a terrible admission, if we can really believe the Government, after the term of this Government, after nearly a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we have seen the last of unemployment; the Government has admitted that. Let us remember that the last forecast was that unemployment would peak at 10 3/4 per cent. It got to 11.1 per cent. Now the Government is saying, `Trust us. It will drop back to 10 per cent mid-next year and it will flatten off at 8 per cent in four years time'. Well, that is not good enough. It is not good enough to throw money at the problems. Finally, why does the Government not face up to the real problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where there is some increase in funding in the Budget. This is very interesting. I draw the attention of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, to the fact that in the portfolio estimates there is an increase in funding for one particular area and that is the insolvency and trustee area in Australia. For expenditure under the Bankruptcy Act there will be an increase from $15m-odd to $26.5m. But there is more. In fact, there is going to be computerisation. That will involve an extra increase of $2.8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcies are the only success story of this Government. In fact, this year all-up bankruptcies jumped to 17,500 people&mdash;up from 9,100 two years ago. But the figures are hidden. Let us remember that when a proprietary limited company is wound up, it does not go broke; it is an insolvency. Insolvencies this year jumped to 9,579&mdash;so under this Government this year all-up bankruptcies and failures add up to 27,166. It is an absolute disgrace. This Government's only claim to success is the growth in bankruptcies. The only extra funds being provided to cope with that growth are being provided to that department to handle those bankruptcies. It is a lost opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the collapse of funding. Let us look at the revenue side of Budget Paper No. 2. It is interesting that the 1990-91 figure for companies was $14.2 billion. The actual figure for l991-92 dropped to $13.4 billion. This year again it dropped to $12.1 billion. But let us not stop there. Let us look at the revenue that comes from small business partnerships and investments. The estimate of the Government for the year 1991-92 was $8.750 billion; that was its estimate. The figure came in at $6.4 billion&mdash;well under its estimate. What is it hoping for this year? It is pretty bright; it is hoping for an increase&mdash;only a slight increase&mdash;of $6.7-odd billion.

If we give them a chance, they can do it. We are about taking taxes off industry and off business to give them a chance. The Government is about putting on taxes and charges. In fact, in this Budget it has a darned car parking tax as well. When will the Government get out of this taxing mode and give business the opportunity to compete?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Fightback we are about taking taxes off. Payroll tax is a tax not only on employing people but also on doing business. The hard pressed manufacturers in Victoria in the industries that have been killed off by this Government would be more competitive if they could wipe payroll tax off the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the figure for wholesales sales tax of $9.4 billion was about the only thing that came in fairly close to budget in the Budget. Again, we would give business a chance. We are about wiping $1.7 billion worth of wholesale sales tax off the costs of exports. But, more importantly, we will be taking the taxes off the cost of doing business. The removal of fuel excise of $6.6 billion will also give our industries a chance. If we take the taxes off our industries and our businesses, they can compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not about knocking workers. The Treasurer said that we do not have faith in Australia. Well, I have to tell honourable members that we have great faith in Australia. We have a faith that our manufacturers and workers can take on the rest of the world and win. We have in this country a well trained and well educated work force. We do not want to finish up having in this country the best educated dole queues in the world. We believe that we can do well. We believe that can be done through a better trade surplus, repaying the foreign debt and giving the workers a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Government's policy the average tradesman who wants to work overtime on a Saturday will jump up the tax scale. I will give a quick example: a tradesman on $450 a week now, after tax, earns about $9.88 per hour. If he works overtime on a Saturday, the first two hours are at time and a half and the next at double time. So his gross pay jumps to about $627, his tax doubles and his hourly rate drops to $8.56. So the guys say, `Mate, I am not interested in working'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our package of tax cuts, that tradesman can double his income and pay a tax rate of 30c in the dollar. We will give tax cuts of 30 per cent or $13 billion to reward people who want to put in the effort. This country was built on reward for hard work and effort. We can return to that situation by creating jobs and giving people the incentive and reward for hard work and effort. If they want to save, let us reward them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the last two years the Liberal Party has been about talking down the economy, in an effort and a hope of seeing the fortunes of Australians in a worse position&mdash;for their own political gain. It is about time that some of these prophecies of doom are put to rest and that the Australian people are able to have a look at the genuine situation&mdash;as attested to not only by Australian business people but also by international agencies&mdash;rather than, as the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) was wont to do, going through a rather droll collage of press releases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year there has been significant growth in the Australian economy. It is significant in terms of not just Australia's recent experience but also international experience.

That is right on track for a 3 per cent growth in the financial year 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the countries that those opposite would have us emulate. The United Kingdom has followed the Thatcherite policies that have been so warmly embraced by those opposite. This year, the United Kingdom is expected to have a growth rate of&mdash;wait for it&mdash;0.4 per cent. In fact, I understand that in the most recent figures that country has dipped back into recession. That is the result of the Thatcherite policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States is to have a 2.1 per cent growth level. In fact, at that figure America is anticipated to have the greatest growth amongst those important economic countries. We will achieve 2.6 per cent. The Opposition sits there and says, `Where is the plan for economic growth?'. In spite of the evidence, in spite of the facts, in spite of our experience, it endeavours to talk the economy down. It should be condemned by the electorate for its negative and quite deceitful representation of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we are performing that well is that for the first time since the Second World War this country has restructured so that we no longer sit back and rely upon digging holes in the ground and selling a bit of wool, wheat, sugar or a few other things. For the first time since the Second World War we have restructured to become a manufacturing exporter of substantial measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparisons between what the Opposition had when it tried to run this country and the current situation are dramatic. When we look at major exports in the manufactured fields, things we have not just dug out of the ground and put in a ship but things we have made&mdash;things like motor vehicles&mdash;we find a dramatic change in the past 10 years. The most recent figure published in the Winter 1992 Treasury <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Round-Up</EMPHASIS> shows that motor vehicle exports in 1991 were worth $414m. Ten years ago when those opposite were in office they were worth $20m. That is a change of over 2,000 per cent. That is an average annual growth every year of 27 per cent in the export of vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In office machines and computers there is the same situation&mdash;growth of 33 per cent on average every year for the past 10 years. That is something those opposite never contemplated, much less achieved. Telecommunication equipment is the same story, showing a 22 per cent average increase every year for the past 10 years. So those exports now are quite substantial. In new areas such as medical, pharmaceutical and scientific products, there is an annual growth rate over the past 10 years of 13 per cent&mdash;every single year. They are the facts. They are the facts which those opposite try to hide from the public for their own cheap political interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment was mentioned, and I will make some reference to that as well because no doubt it is the key concern for the nation and for all members in this place. It is no doubt the case that unemployment is far too high, and no member of this House takes any comfort or pride in that. But when we compare the situation in March 1983, when we came to office, with March 1992, there are some interesting results. It is true that unemployment has gone up by about 600,000. It is also true that the number of people who have a job has gone up by about 1.2 million. Well in excess of one million more people are actively employed now than at the time when we came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the economy over that period has grown dramatically. It has grown because of this Government's policies. But in spite of that growth the Liberal Party and the Opposition persist with their efforts to denigrate the country and to denigrate the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comment has been made about whether the deficit in this Budget is appropriate. The size of the deficit in this Budget is quite modest by Australian standards and by international comparison. We have a projected deficit of 3.3 per cent of our gross domestic product. In dollar terms that is about $13.3 billion. That $13 billion deficit that we will have this year should be seen against the surpluses which this Government returned in the four years 1987-88 through until 1990-91. During that period this Government generated surpluses of $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the surpluses the Opposition generated we get a very different picture. Indeed, the Opposition has never generated a surplus at all&mdash;not at all. From the day Bob Menzies got the idea to spawn the Liberal Party, not once did it return a surplus budget. Never&mdash;not once in its entire history in government&mdash;did it have a surplus budget. The Labor Government is the only government in the last 40 years to return a surplus budget. It is those surpluses, built up through the 1980s when the economy was probably overheating with too much money floating around, which this Government is very responsibly using to finance much-needed employment programs and welfare assistance to those most hurt by the recent recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case we think we are out of kilter with the rest of the world, let us have a look at what the OECD projects for deficit budgets around the world. Let us look at the G7 again, the most powerful economic nations in the world. The average for all of those nations this year as projected by the OECD is a 3.6 per cent deficit budget&mdash;which is more than Australia is planning, more than this Government is planning in the current Budget. Again when you look at some of the people those opposite would have us follow, we see that Canada will have a deficit in this calendar year of 3.6 per cent of its gross domestic product; the United Kingdom 4.2 per cent; Italy 10 per cent; and the United States somewhere around 5 per cent. The deficit provided for in this Budget is entirely responsible, well within the means of the nation to meet, and well under that of comparable nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical question the people of Australia want answered by those opposite when they hop up to criticise this Budget is where will they find the $7 billion which they will not fund this year? Will they take out the $369m for schools or the $345m for local government projects? Or will it be the $188m for urban development and public housing? In both those areas they have already gone on record as saying they will abolish those programs. I could go through the list of other initiatives that are in this Budget if time permitted, but unfortunately it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear question those opposite have to confront every time they hop up to talk about the Budget is which $7 billion do they want to cut out? Until they come clean with the answer to the $7 billion question, the people of Australia will not have a bar of them or their policies, and nor should they. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this motion to refer to the Public Works Committee the proposal to develop an Air Force base at Peppan on the Cape York Peninsula. The coalition is of the view that the development of an air base on the Cape York Peninsula is an important part of any approach to northern defence. In the event of a defence contingency in our north, this air base could play a significant role in providing a point for logistic and maintenance support as well as for tactical air operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have a base at Tindal in the Northern Territory and the so-called bare-base at Derby in Western Australia. The addition of this facility will complete a chain of bases across northern Australia which, as I have said, will facilitate air operations in times of emergency in our north. It a worthwhile defence objective and one which signals Australia's commitment to develop a significant defence presence in that part of our land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having indicated our support for referring the project to the Public Works Committee, we would also ask that the Committee give consideration to another issue&mdash;the proposal to develop a satellite launch facility on the eastern side of the peninsula, at Temple Bay. I put it to the Committee for its consideration that if the spaceport development goes ahead there will then be, within 80 kilometres of each other, two airfields on the peninsula capable of landing international standard aircraft&mdash;by `international standard aircraft', I mean models such as the Boeing 747, the jumbo&mdash;and heavily laden military aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Committee looks at this issue and, in particular, examines the thought which has been given already to collocating the airfields. It would be interesting to know why there has been a resistance so far to collocation, as the  two airfields will be, as I have already indicated, a short distance apart. When exercises are being contemplated, if they remain separate, that may again pose problems for aircraft controllers and for the use of airspace. Certainly, collocating the sites would simplify the task of maintaining airfield defence, amongst other things. In other words, it is quite apparent that in the event of a contingency both airfields would be commandeered for the use of the military and both would be required to be defended. I suspect also that aircraft movements could be controlled from an airport established to service the proposed satellite launch facility about which I have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions have already been raised by others, including Dr Ross Babbage. It is an important matter and one which I hope the Committee will make inquiries about during its investigations and deliberations.

<PARA>Effective management of the migration program is essential in ensuring that planned program outcomes are not exceeded.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act currently provides for two broad program control mechanisms; namely, the power to suspend processing in specified classes and a system of pass marks for the independent and concessional family categories. This pass mark system, which is currently in operation, controls visa issue by allowing for the approval, `pooling' and rejection of applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suspension power in section 28 of the Act has not been exercised but it forms a powerful administrative tool in ensuring that program levels are not exceeded. However, it is also a very blunt one. There is no facility to set a numerical limit. It also unnecessarily suspends all processing, even where that processing would not result in the program being exceeded. Resorting to an across the board suspension power would cause very uneven workload patterns at overseas posts and, given the processing delays involved, would lessen the capacity of the program to be increased readily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will remedy these problems by supplementing the visa suspension powers. The new provisions permit the imposition of numerical ceilings, or caps, for a class or classes of visas and allow the processing of applications up to the point of grant.

Once the cap is reached, no more visas in the capped class or classes will be able to be granted, although other processing would not be impeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that the cap is not inadvertently exceeded, the Bill permits the Minister to implement an effective administrative mechanism which allows the orderly grant of visas while the cap is in place.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to remove uncertainties about the enforcement of laws concerning truth in labelling of wine. In 1989, the Commonwealth Parliament amended the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to implement a wine label integrity program. The wine label integrity program was developed at the request of the wine industry and requires wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety and region of origin of wine. These records and the stocks to which they relate must also be made available for audit upon request by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The aim of the program is to ensure truth in labelling and so increase consumer confidence in the reliability of wine label claims. The program also aims to ensure that all wine makers compete honestly amongst themselves in the marketing of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first label integrity program inspections occurred in the Clare Valley of South Australia in 1990. No breaches of the record keeping provisions occurred and no instances of fraud were detected. However, practice in using the legislation where over 200 audits have now been conducted has highlighted technical deficiencies which are likely to impair the enforcement of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 requires manufacturers to keep label integrity program records, but there is no requirement that the records be accurate and complete. Further, where the Corporation under section 42 of the Act requests a manufacturer to provide label integrity program records the manufacturer must provide the records, even if they are self-incriminating, but the manufacturer is then protected from prosecution should the records disclose false labelling. Thus, there is some doubt whether a successful prosecution concerning false labelling could be launched under the present provisions of the Act. This Bill aims to rectify these deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does four key things. First, where label integrity program records are required to be kept under the Act, clause 39ZAAA makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly fail to make and keep such records, or to make and keep false, misleading or incomplete records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, section 42 of the Act, which requires a person to provide information to the Corporation on request and indemnifies the person from prosecution where such information is furnished, is amended. The amendment removes the label integrity program provisions from the ambit of section 42 but  otherwise  leaves  section  42 unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, clause 39ZAA of the Bill provides that where the Corporation requests a person to provide label integrity program records, the person may with reasonable excuse refuse the request. The Bill provides that it is a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse to provide label integrity program records where they are self-incriminating. The aim of these amendments is to enable the Corporation to instigate a prosecution where label integrity program records, provided at the Corporation's request, disclose false labelling of wine, while retaining the right of a person to refuse to provide such records where they are self-incriminating. Where a person chooses, with reasonable excuse, not to provide the records, the Corporation may still exercise its inspection powers to obtain label integrity program records and will be able to use those records to initiate a prosecution. Thus the original intention of the legislation will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 39ZAC of the Bill enables the Corporation to retain label integrity program records for 60 days or, if a prosecution for a label offence is initiated within 60 days, until proceedings and appeals are concluded. A person will be able to inspect or copy the records provided to the Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is to amend the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 to give effect to the light vehicles agreement formulated at the Heads of Government meeting on 11 May 1992. The agreement involves a regime for vehicles weighing 4.5 tonnes or less, their drivers, other road users and related matters. This will expand the powers and functions of the National Road Transport Commission, NRTC, to include regulation of all motorised vehicles and not just those vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes. In addition, the Commission shall exercise responsibility for policy development for light vehicles, excluding the determination of charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the National Road Transport Commission was formally established at the beginning of this year, it was hailed as a major step towards achieving fundamental and lasting reforms of road transport&mdash;reforms which would benefit all Australians as a result of a more efficient road transport industry sector. In the short time the Commission has been operating, it has achieved significant progress towards the development of uniform charges and technical standards for heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission has earned a reputation for its independence and fairness through extensive formal and informal consultations with industry and governments. The first recommendations of the NRTC in relation to heavy vehicle charges have been considered and approved by the ministerial council. The charging determinations have received support from a convincing majority of States. The charges have also received overwhelming support from the road transport industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Transport Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The addition of light vehicles to the terms of reference of the National Road Transport Commission is another significant step towards creating a single national road transport regulatory environment. Australians are one of the most mobile people on earth. The ability to move freely anywhere in the country is something we consider a fundamental right. Nevertheless, one of the most basic ways through which we enjoy our right of mobility on the ground is governed by a myriad of different regulations. Even to the basics of traffic rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many places on State borders, such as in Albury-Wodonga, Tweed Heads-Gold Coast, and in the Canberra-Queanbeyan region, near neighbours and colleagues who have the same type of car, are subject to different registration requirements, different inspection requirements and differing on-road requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management and development of the regulations covering light vehicles has meant duplication of work amongst the States. The National Road Transport Commission will play a significant role in facilitating and ensuring continued cooperation among the States and Territories to reach a solution to these problems. It will create the basis for a nationally consistent legislative framework which will streamline administrative processes in government bureaucracies across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our roads constitute a major asset to this country, but it is also an asset which requires constant maintenance and upgrading. An important function of the Commission will be to assist in the development of indicators which can provide better ways of assessing how we, as a nation, are coping with this task. The Commission will collect and publish information on important issues affecting road transport. Information will be assembled and published on the comparative assessment of the performance of road authorities and road systems. This will assist all levels of government by providing a better, more balanced view on the delivery of road funding programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Commission will monitor the use of alternative fuels and publish information on road safety. The Commission will not  pursue uniformity purely  for  uniformity's sake. In a number of specified areas, it must demonstrate that significant net benefits would  arise  before developing proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the individual amendments which are set out in the Bill. The principal amendment in the Bill will provide for the inclusion of the light vehicles agreement in a schedule to the National Road Transport Commission Act. The proposed amendments will expand the terms of reference of the National Road Transport Commission to include a range of issues relating to light vehicles. The Commission will also assemble and publish information on road funding, the taxes and road related charges applying to light vehicles, the performance of our road systems, the effectiveness of road authorities, and on road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments proposed within the Bill cover those areas which make specific reference to issues covered by either the heads of government agreement on heavy vehicles or the light vehicles agreement. These amendments do not affect the manner in which the Commission and the ministerial council operate, but are limited to clarifying which agreement is referred to. The Commission is funded through contributions by the Commonwealth and the States based on shares approved by the ministerial council. The Commonwealth contribution is 35 per cent. In 1992-93 this amounts to $1.1m. The financial impact on the Commonwealth of the expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successful and lasting reforms which facilitate a better, more efficient road transport environment has been a priority for this Government. The expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission to include light vehicles is certain to bring benefits to all Australians.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect all governments to continue to honour the commitment by heads of government to implement a uniform national road transport registration system.

<PARA>This Bill proposes to ensure the validity of amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations to reflect the superannuation guarantee arrangements. On the basis of legal advice, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 was not presented to the Governor-General on 30 June 1992. That advice indicated that it would not be appropriate to seek royal assent owing to the fact that the SG Bill was not passed in identical form by both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>

That advice was on the basis that 1 July 1992 would be the commencement date for the SG Bill, when it was enacted, and that it would follow that the commencement date of the amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations would be 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent legal advice raised doubt about the validity of this approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the House debated some neighbouring legislation which was directed at overcoming the potential legal problems relating to the incorrect passage of legislation through this House and the Senate. We welcome the opportunity to debate the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations Application Bill 1992 principally because even at this late hour it gives the Opposition another opportunity to place on the record for all to see and hear why we believe at this stage that it is not in Australia's interests to be introducing a universal, compulsory system of superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming majority of the workers who will lose their jobs because of this legislation will be young people with low skills and part time casual workers who are mainly women. This effect will be compounded when the system brings into the net a further 850,000 non-managerial, non-award private sector wage and salary earners most of whom are not currently covered by superannuation, are employed in small business and are on very modest incomes. Also, a further 50,000 to 100,000 public sector employees are currently lacking effective coverage because of poor vesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also another 650,000 employees who have no award superannuation coverage because their employers cannot afford to comply with the award due to the outstanding superannuation liabilities which are currently estimated to be around $700m. Under this legislation those outstanding amounts will have to be paid over the next 12 months. I put it to the House: has this Government seriously considered what the impact of having to find a further $700m will be on small and medium business in particular?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is well aware that when this matter was announced originally the Confederation of Australian Industry made it absolutely clear that, on the basis of the surveys it had conducted, there would be a loss of between 60,000 and 100,000 employees. On average that represented 2.9 per cent of the work force in each company which had subscribed to that survey. Nothing has changed and, if anything, the circumstances faced by many of these companies have got worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It simply amazes the Opposition why it is that, at a time of such high unemployment, we have a Government which seems determined to set upon a course of action the purpose of which is to increase significantly the on-costs of employing labour in Australia. This is precisely why in our Fightback package, among the seven taxes which we would abolish with the direct and deliberate intention of increasing employment opportunities and reducing the current tendency of putting people out of work, we establish the need to abolish the payroll tax, which would save Australian business $5.9 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also abolish the lump sum superannuation tax currently before the House, although we have made it clear that the level which we inherit will be the base level which will apply across the economy. The training guarantee levy will also be abolished. That, again, is a cost to employers. There are other changes in the Fightback package which will undoubtedly make it cheaper and more versatile for employers to look to the future in a more productive and optimistic manner. It is an extraordinary situation that at this time we see in the superannuation levy, the SGL, yet another effort to increase costs. In fact, it has been estimated that the total costs of labour will probably increase by between 9 and 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employers of most of those 1.5 million workers to whom I have already referred will be required to go from nought per cent to 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent or more in just one year if this legislation is implemented. We hear rumours. Statements are made sotto voce by various Ministers that if unemployment continues to rise, perhaps the timing of the introduction of the SGL can be changed once again. This is just a very dubious and false way of saying to those who are affected most, `Yes, we were wrong, but we don't have the courage to admit it'. That, sadly, in so many areas is the legacy of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost, as I have identified, will be around $2 billion a year. That is on top of the 4.5 per cent wages claim currently being pursued by the ACTU and other costs such as the training guarantee levy and payroll tax. That is why it is not difficult to demonstrate that over recent times the cost of employing labour has increased by approximately 10 per cent, at a time when employers are looking for excuses to divest themselves of labour on the grounds that the level of productivity of their work force under current economic circumstances cannot justify the oncosts and the supplementary costs of employing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the time at which the SGL comes in at 4 or 5 per cent for larger firms is irrelevant in terms of a total final outcome. The jump in employer contributions will be enormous for many firms, especially for those small businesses which have not been contributing as perhaps by law they should have been. They have failed to do so because they have not had the money. It is as simple as that. The alternative for a small employer faced with those circumstances is to say, `What do I do? I break the law or I call in my employees and say, ``Sorry, fellows, you're out. We're closing the doors"'. That has happened in thousands of industries and thousands of small businesses across this country over the last two years or so. In the middle of the worst recession in the last 60 years of Australia's economic history, we find this Government determined to proceed with this legislation which is utterly false and wrong at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury evidence which was given to the Senate Committee was quite stark. We were told that if employers bear the full cost burden, up to 45,000 jobs will be lost over the next two years and up to 100,000 over the next five years. Senator Cook has already conceded that non-compliance is costing some $700m a year, according to his own Department. The reason has been given: employers cannot afford to pay. Yet now they are being told by law, `You will fork up or else'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Award superannuation now nominally covers some 85 per cent of wage and salary earners, yet the compliance levels are much less, at around 65 per cent. It does not apply to the self-employed&mdash;some 20 per cent of total employment in the private sector and 15 per cent of the total economy. As a result of the SGL, approximately 1.5 million employees will be brought into the net for the first time. These will include almost 1,000,000 non-managerial, non-award private sector wage and salary earners, as well as some public sector employees, and a further 500,000 employees of non-complying employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approximate projected new flows to the first full year of operation will be more than $2 billion, equivalent to 80,000 jobs at an average income of $25,000 each. This money has to be found by those employers, regardless of their economic circumstance. There is no provision in the proposals before the House that the economic difficulties facing those companies are in any sense to be seen as mitigating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that the Australian work force and Australian employers today are being expected to carry the cost of a pre-election accord deal made by the then Hawke-Keating Government before the last election to cement the support of the ACTU. We find it absolutely extraordinary that the ACTU, which sets itself up as the guardian of the future of the working class people of Australia, should have done so little since the last election, despite the devastating reduction in economic activity in this country and the massively high levels of unemployment that have followed. On this point, nothing has been done by the ACTU to encourage the Government to go to employers and say, `We want to reduce wherever we can the oncosts of employing labour'. That demonstrates the fundamental difference between Fightback and the Government's policy. We have put together a policy which is unashamedly directed at improving employment, at creating jobs and at taking $20 billion off the costs of business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our opponents carry on with this program which is adding about 10 per cent to every additional job taken at this time. Adding 10 per cent in additional costs clearly must mean that people at the margin will lose the right to work. We hear so much from the Government, as we did in the Budget last night, about how full employment is once again one of the objectives of its policies. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price), who is at the table: how can Government members seriously talk about full employment when through their legislative program they are going in exactly the opposite direction? We were told last night in the Budget that the Government will create 800,000 jobs within the next four years. In Fightback we said we would create two million jobs by the end of the decade. </PARA>

If we take that 600,000 into account, we will have a net figure of about 200,000 new jobs in four years. That totally ignores population growth and the existing over 300,000 people who are in long term unemployment. One can only conclude that that is a recipe for disaster and for higher and higher unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the very mouth of the Treasurer&mdash;written in his own hand, presumably, in his Budget Speech&mdash;we have been given a figure which on the face of it is extremely conservative. But when we take into account the additional oncosts and imposts on employing more people, including the SGL, we can only conclude that the outcome of employment growth in this country is very dubious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now set out some of the details of what we in the Opposition see as some of the alternatives to the current approach to national superannuation and the SGL strategy which we are debating here today. As we see it, there are two considerations which must be seen as foremost. They are the questions of equity and access to superannuation. In both these concerns we have carefully crafted a system of tax incentives deliberately skewed to favour those on lower incomes. Again, that is exactly the opposite of what the Government is doing in this legislation and what has been its objective over recent months. We believe this is important because, as we hear so often from members of the Government, the system is skewed in favour of high income earners. That is true. There is no doubt about that. The figures are quite clear: 32c in the dollar for some people on high incomes and 16c in the dollar for people on low incomes. My case rests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with these two concerns, therefore, we wanted to develop a program that would ensure that every single person in Australia, whether in the work force or not, would have the opportunity to contribute to his or her long term financial viability in retirement. That is the fundamental difference between the approach of the Government and the approach of the Opposition. That is why our policy, when it is introduced, will give low income Australians in particular and their wives, be they fully employed or part time employed, the opportunity to contribute to superannuation and get from it a 25 per cent rebate which will be universal. It will be right across the spectrum of the system, whether one is at the top of Collins Street, at the top of George Street or working on a farm in the outback. Anybody who has access to superannuation will be entitled to the same level of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation on employee contributions is really the essence of the SGL proposal. The Government has recently announced that it will immediately reduce taxation concessions for low income earners from the current 25 per cent rebate on annual contributions up to $3,000 to a token 10 per cent rebate on contributions up to a miserable $1,000. Furthermore, the tax deductibility of contributions of up to $3,000 for those receiving award superannuation only will be completely abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, our approach is entirely different. We believe that all contributors must be treated in a consistent manner. We believe that tax deductions are inequitable because they have a higher value to taxpayers with higher marginal rates of income tax than to lower income taxpayers. Because of that we are offering a universal system of tax rebates available to all workers rather than the current mishmash of tax deductions and rebates and, for many workers, no tax concessions at all under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contributions by all workers, whether employed or self-employed, will attract a flat 25 per cent rebate in the hands of the member&mdash;up to $6,000 for a single contributor or $12,000 for a couple&mdash;of their total annual superannuation contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going a step further than that, we have said that people who are in part time employment who, for all sorts of administrative and technical reasons have great difficulty getting into what I would describe as mainline superannuation schemes, will be offered a totally new product by us&mdash;a retirement savings account which will work like a bank account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will have the other great advantage which the Government, again, has totally failed to address, despite the very genuine problem it has caused for many low income earners. It is this: if a person works part time under the current system, which is a minimum of about 20 hours per week, and makes a small contribution to her superannuation, she is still subject to a one per cent or 1 1/2 per cent administrative fee which is applied. If the contributor, a part time person&mdash;a woman, for example&mdash;then leaves the work force to have a child and stays out of the work force for two or three years, her contribution rate is frozen but the administrative fee is not frozen. The outcome is that the longer that person stays out of the work force, the lower and lower her final end benefit will be, because every year it is being reduced by the cost of the administrative fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a gross and iniquitous system of which both the ACTU and the Government full well know the results. On the one hand they are saying to low income Australian workers, `Come into the promised land. We are offering you nirvana. We are offering you universal superannuation. Your employer is going to be putting 3, 4 or 5 per cent of his money into your superannuation'. On the other hand they are saying, `Of course, don't expect too many increases in wages because you can't expect to have it both ways'. That is a position that was not articulated very clearly two years ago when this policy was initially announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is this: people who go into a scheme such as that are guaranteed losers unless they have a long period of sustained employment. Ask the 300,000 plus middle aged people today who are thrown onto the unemployment queues, of which only nine in every 100 are currently getting access back into the work force, what is happening to their guaranteed superannuation, whether it be through industry schemes or under the SGL arrangements. All of them are suffering from this defect in the system, because the longer they stay out of employment the less benefit they are going to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one wants to believe the worst scenarios which we see presented to us throughout the 1990s, one may well see half a million people in the category of long term unemployed. Quite simply, that means their contributions are not only frozen but are actually diminishing year by year because of the effect of the one per cent or 1 1/2 per cent administrative cost being applied. If, in many years, the funds themselves do not necessarily make a substantial profit&mdash;and that has certainly been the record for the last three or four years&mdash;one would have to say that the Government is leading these people astray in making them believe that by having a superannuation scheme they are therefore protected financially in their retirement, because that is simply not so. It is not the truth and it is not what people should be being told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation of employer contributions is another subject of considerable importance. Currently, 15 per cent tax is paid by funds on contributions made by employers on behalf of their employees. This tax does not vary with the employees' income and is therefore regressive. As I said earlier, like everything else in this current system, it favours high income earners over low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition intends to replace this iniquitous tax regime with a variable tax on contributions based on individuals' marginal tax rate, less the 25 per cent rebate on annual contributions up to $6,000 single or $12,000 for a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great advantage of our system which I should emphasise is this: if a person cannot use up his entitlement in any one year, the credit goes forward, so that as he develops through his income spectrum of life, assuming he does not have great periods of unemployment, he will later be able to pick up the benefits of superannuation credits which he did not effectively use earlier in life. The further great advantage is this: where one has access to $6,000 single or $12,000 for a couple, that means if a person is so able to do, an employed person can actually take out superannuation for his or her spouse up to the limit of $12,000 contribution a year, which effectively gives them a maximum coverage of $600,000 for a couple or $300,000 for a single person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an initiative of enormous value because it means that all those hundreds of thousands of women in the Australian work force who have traditionally been locked out of the system and who are now making up 75 per cent of the total contribution to the work force of part time and temporary employees are being given an opportunity to access retirement savings accounts or through mainline superannuation contributions being made by their spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we hear from the Government on this matter? I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in one simple phrase: abject silence. It has left the field because the ACTU is not interested in these people. One has to ask why that is so. The answer is simple: on the whole, they are not unionised. They have nobody to protect them and, frankly, even if they were unionised, under current rules they still would not have anybody to protect them because they are the ones who are losing their jobs. Once people no longer pay their contributions to the union, nobody gives a damn about them any more. That is one of the saddest things of all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can call it a lot of rubbish. The fact is that none of these women have been given adequate access to long term retirement income support or planning under the Government's policy over the last 10 years. In 1988 we announced in this Parliament and elsewhere the basis of this policy approach. On every occasion since 1988 my colleagues and I have stated in this House the direction of policy change which we recommend to the Government. Time after time it has turned its face from it. In doing so it has deliberately ignored not only the women in the work force but the other hundreds of thousands of people whom one would expect to have as much right to retirement income support as anybody else. Instead of that, the Government left in place a system which was grossly in favour of high income earners and did little, if anything, to help people at the bottom. The Government is now taking from them the one thing which everybody needs: some concept of security in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a long and difficult issue to cover. There are other aspects which are worth noting. For example, the raising of the preservation age is something which the Government seems to be addressing at last. We raised this in our 1988 policy and we raised it again last year in the Fightback policy. It is important because the Government again left open a system by which people regarded superannuation not as long term planning but simply as a supplementary form of income support when they chose to leave one employer and transfer either out of the work force or to another employer and take their superannuation with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preservation age is therefore essential if one seriously wants to justify any level of taxation support for long term income planning. For that reason, we raised the age from 55 to 60 years to overcome a fundamental error put in the system by the Government's best friend, the ACTU. The ACTU took the view in the last days of the last recession that a simple solution to the recession was not necessarily economic growth, but just encouraging `older' workers&mdash;that is, workers aged 55 or more&mdash;to leave the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may have been, as I thought, grossly unsound 10 years ago; but it is catastrophic today because Australia is facing the reality of an ageing population, as are all other countries in the Western world. We now have a certain attitudinal approach, especially among our employers. We seem to work on the simple principle we see in advertisements which say, `Wanted, mature age 25-year-old with 50 years experience'. Honourable members know and I know that that is an absolute impossibility. But it does demonstrate that the ACTU, as a major player in the early 1980s, encouraged the Government to support and allow people to leave the work force at age 55 in the belief that somehow or other they would be protected financially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality was that the average size of the superannuation benefit in those years&mdash;and in fact it has not changed all that much during this decade&mdash;was a lump sum pay-out of around $50,000 to $60,000. That is hardly the basis of a serious long term income support strategy. By increasing the retirement age to 60 years we are simply putting on the line the fact that if people want taxation support, that proportion of their funds should not be touched until they are at least 60 years of age, with the deliberate intention of encouraging an ageing population to stay in the work force longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone much further in Fightback. We have also provided for people who are part pensioners or full pensioners to be able to make a decision when they turn 60 or 65. This provision is twofold. If people want to stay in the work force longer they should have the right to do so. We can no longer apply a Bismarckian concept which was developed in western Europe&mdash;in Prussia, to be exact&mdash;in the 1870s which brought in 65 years as the notional retirement age against which all benefits were based. People are now living longer and healthier lives and there are more of them. Therefore, for all of those reasons, people should be encouraged to stay in the work force longer and contribute to society and their own financial well-being&mdash;if we have an economy which can sustain that level of employment and not the current shambles which we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why access to superannuation at 60 years of age is a useful, sensible and far-sighted reform which we are introducing under Fightback. I am glad to see that the Government is slowly, but very surely, coming to realise the error of its ways and those of its mates in the ACTU. Similarly, we are abolishing the lump sum superannuation taxes. This is an insidious proposal brought in by the Government which effectively had taxes at every level of superannuation. People paid tax when they put in their contribution, they paid another tax on the dividend from that contribution, they paid a further tax when they took out the funds, and they paid income tax on the non-taxed proportion of their savings when they took it in the form of an annuity or a spread of income. So the abolition of lump sum taxation is a very important element of that equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I emphasise once again that by allowing superannuation for couples we are entering a new area where we are encouraging everybody in the work force&mdash;whether they are married or single; whether they are in employment or not in employment&mdash;to make a contribution, providing they have the capacity to do so. Superannuation should be viable for people as a long term method of saving to give them genuine retirement support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for your very kind consideration with regard to my well being. I am delighted to see you in the chair at the moment because the amendment to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill 1992 has a lot to do with the marine environment. I spent a good deal of my boyhood days in the electorate of Corio making good use of that area of sea or bay catching some good fish&mdash;all a legal size, of course. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would have had the same experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975</EMPHASIS> to ensure that the enforcement provisions of the Act are adequate for the purpose of protecting those marine reptiles, birds and mammals to which Part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Regulations applies, making the powers in the Act consistent with, and no less stringent than, the enforcement powers in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whale Protection Act 1980</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fisheries Management Act 1991</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members may remember that the excellent Whale Protection Act 1980 was brought in by the Fraser Government, along with many other outstanding contributions to the environmental world in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is an important final step in a process of coordination and rationalisation of legislation which provides for the protection and wide use of Australia's marine biodiversity and bioresources. This process started with the introduction of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. This Act appropriately specifies that the term `fish' does not include marine fauna such as reptiles&mdash;for example, sea snakes, turtles, crocodiles&mdash;or marine mammals, excepting whales and dolphins, which are protected under the Whale Protection Act 1980. This left a gap in the conservation of the latter marine wildlife. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992 fills that gap. It does so by including flora and fauna which are indigenous to the continental shelf of Australia and its immediate marine realm, by recognising the extensive ebb and flow and broad scale connectivity of marine ecosystems, for example the migratory planktonic drift species, and by providing for strict conservation, management and enforcement provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With more than 75 per cent of our population living on the coastal fringe, all Australians are dependent on the living Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans which lap our shores. It is vital for our future social and economic needs that we protect our precious marine wildlife. It may come as quite a surprise that the majority of marine species remain unknown and undescribed by science. A lot of people are not aware of the fact that a myriad of creatures, particularly in the marine sphere, as yet have never been discovered and scientists today confess that there may well have been many species that have lived in the marine biosphere which have come and gone; they have become extinct and no-one has ever known of their existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At whatever level of classification the biodiversity of the oceans is studied, it is likely to be several-fold that of the land; at the genetic level, the difference is likely to be even greater. I might mention at this stage a reference in the biodiversity report put out some months ago by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, of which I am a member. An excerpt from this report is entitled `Marine biodiversity'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientists currently recognise 70 phyla representing all known life, from bacteria to vertebrates. About 20 of these occur exclusively in the marine environment and 18 are exclusively terrestrial. Of the remaining phyla, 23 contain marine species, whereas only 10 more contain terrestrial species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore at the phylum level, the biodiversity of the oceans is about double that of the land. At the species level the difference is likely to be greater. In terms of ecological community composition, land and sea environments are vastly different.</PARA>
<PARA>I mention that quote to highlight the absolute importance of the kind of legislation on this particular amendment that we are discussing in the House this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst many tropical marine species are widespread, much of Australia's southern marine species are endemic&mdash;that is, they are unique and not found anywhere else in the world. It is therefore all the more important that we pay particular attention to the kind of amendment before the House today and be ready to bring in further amendments to protect species that perhaps hitherto we were not aware might have been endangered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is enormous potential for the development of non-extractive bioresources from our marine biodiversity. The House may find it interesting to hear about a couple of those unique and most interesting creatures in our marine areas around Australia that have provided scientists with a great deal of excitement in terms of research and what they have been able to do as a result of that research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is that the sun screening agents of shallow water corals are now under commercial development. In other words, the screening potential of shallow water corals against ultraviolet rays and the effect of intense sunlight in shallow waters, which has been developed and provided by nature itself, has caused scientists, particularly those in the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville, to make some very interesting discoveries in regard to protective sun screens that they are now able to develop commercially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some sea slugs have simple nervous systems that are valuable in medical research. Again as a result of science we are getting assistance in the ordinary fields; that enables us to live better and healthier lives. The study of the shell structure of deepwater molluscs has provided for the development of flexible concrete. Scientists have in recent years taken some of these molluscs that live several miles below the sea for the purpose of researching their shell structure. We know the kind of structure that man has to design in the form of submarines et cetera to go to such depths, and there is a great limitation on those. Yet these simple molluscs are able to live at these depths and not be crushed by these huge weights. Scientists, in their investigation into why they are not crushed, have discovered that the structure of the shells of these molluscs is so brilliant that they have tried to copy what they have discovered and have been able to produce, using the same structure, some thin forms of concrete which is able to withstand huge stresses. So we were again able to learn something from nature, in this case from the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research at Macquarie University under the leadership of Professor Beattie and his colleagues has shown that there is enormous potential for the use of microbial communities to break down pollutants, termed bioremediation, in marine sediments, another huge advance as a result of scientists being able to study in more detail the kinds of things that nature has provided in our marine environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned in my introductory remarks on this Bill last night the firm in my electorate known as Memtec, a firm that has become world famous for its development and its research into membrane technology in the filtration of pollutants, particularly those that we had over the years very dangerously and carelessly poured into the marine environment. Unfortunately, today we are still doing this, but this firm Memtec has made enormous progress in its development of these filtration technologies. It is sad to realise that a firm of the quality of Memtec is under threat of having to move its whole organisation offshore to be sufficiently viable to continue its research operations. I hope that does not happen and I hope, if the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) is listening&mdash;even though he has provided many hundreds of thousands of dollars in a very generous way for the research and development that has been undertaken by Memtec&mdash;that he will look as a matter of considerable urgency at the plight that I believe is confronting the board of Memtec at the moment as they try to decide whether they should remain in Australia or leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, it is clear that many in the Australian community are concerned about the welfare of the coastal marine realm and the maintenance of marine biodiversity. All this has a great deal of relevance to this particular amendment. Community ownership at the grassroots is best facilitated through public education and involvement in local projects. Community enthusiasm to maintain the unique biodiversity of this environment could be harnessed through a Commonwealth funded community based program administered under the National Parks and Wildlife Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ERA Committee received unanimous support when it canvassed the idea of a Commonwealth assisted, community based program for the coastal marine zone; in other words, a community based program that was going to take care of the marine environment, give the people responsibility and help them along the way from a financial point of view. Accordingly, in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biodiversity: The contribution of community-based programs</EMPHASIS> that I quoted from earlier, the Committee recommended in recommendation No. 30 on page 71:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Commonwealth, in the implementation of a national coastal zone management strategy and national biodiversity strategy, develop and implement a Commonwealth funded community-based program that focuses on the maintenance of biodiversity and ecological processes in the maritime, coastal environment.</PARA>
<PARA>No recommendation could be related more closely to the particular amendment that we happen to have under discussion this afternoon. We saw how a group of communities on the north coast of New South Wales at Byron Bay, I think it was, came to the aid of marine species&mdash;I think it was whales&mdash;in recent months and spent days and days, and caught the attention of the whole of Australia. Many people throughout the world were interested in the newsworthiness of such a community-based desire to get these animals back out to sea where they would survive. That is an indication of the readiness of the community to get involved in particular programs to care for the maritime environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sad things about that rescue operation on the north coast was the report in the media that, even though there was a great contribution by the community, $7,000 worth of wetsuits were not returned after the event took place. I hope that that has been rectified and that people who may have been unaware of the fact that they could not take the wetsuits will see that they are returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992 further strengthens the Commonwealth's role in the protection of the marine environment and has increased potential for the implementation of these policies recommended by the Standing Committee. I commend that report to the Parliamentary Secretary because it has not yet been responded to. We know the Minister has to respond to that report within three months and we are looking forward to that response. The Opposition supports this particular Bill and I commend the whole Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue debate on the Disability Discrimination Bill to reinforce the idea that, as a Government, we are committed to justice, to a fair and just society and to equality of life for all Australians. As I was saying when the debate was adjourned, this is no better exemplified than in the Budget, in which we have provided a range of measures. One of those measures provided in the Budget which deals particularly with the concerns of those people who are hard of hearing in our community is the 12-month feasibility study aimed at giving people with speech and hearing impairments access to a national telephone typewriter relay service. This will be conducted in both New South Wales and Victoria, and will provide a 24 hour service. This is something which people in our community have wanted for a very long time, and I am certainly hopeful that it will be well supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other programs is that assistance towards the cost of continence items will be provided. For many people this is a very significant cost in their household budget. That is a real measure of concern to people with special needs. Rent assistance will be increased, as will the domiciliary nursing care benefits. In addition, there will be an expansion of Commonwealth rehabilitation services which will benefit 700 people with more severe disabilities, and there will be more than 2,000 additional places to support people with disabilities during training or job placement. A further 600 work experience program places will be provided. The purpose of all these reforms is to achieve meaningful and enduring reforms. If these reforms are to be achieved, there is a need for cooperation at all levels of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, an unprecedented partnership exists between people with disabilities and their families, all levels of government, service providers, employers and unions. This is resulting in significant changes in opportunities for people with a disability. The disability reform package is an excellent example of how the Government is committed to developing cooperative initiatives which focus on individual needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill, when enacted, will assist in broadening the Government's reforms to all areas of government, and also encourage private industry to adopt these reforms. The kinds of reforms we are talking about are, at times, very simple. While we have the Opposition continuing to espouse the needs and demands of themselves through a Senate inquiry for a further talkfest on this matter, we have seen some action. A group of young people in my electorate who use wheelchairs suggested that they could not get in and out of the post office so ramps were built, as were electronic doors. It was very simple, not just for them but for people with strollers, people who would find it a bit hard to go up and down stairs, and so on. So it is essential that the Government give the lead to the community to ensure that measures are taken to enable quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this Disability Discrimination Bill which actually raises the level of our concern and also raises our attitudes and awareness to this. It is this legislation which is vital to awakening and strengthening our national consciousness to the rights, needs and responsibilities of people with a disability, and ensuring that they have proper avenues for redress in the case of discrimination. Today very many of us have heard of all kinds of discrimination at work. We have heard of children denied medical treatment because, perhaps, it was considered that it would be better given to somebody else. We know of places, such as restaurants, where people are denied access for a whole range of reasons. Sometimes people do not want to be near others, sometimes people suggest that there is something different about them and so, in fact, they do not want them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a society which is multifaceted and, indeed, the focus and the emphasis should be very much on ability. We all have abilities. We all have a whole range of abilities. Indeed, that is the kind of focus which we, in our community, should be focusing on. It is that kind of focus which it is necessary to raise within the community. The Disability Discrimination Bill, while it provides avenues for people to seek redress, also reminds us, as a community, that we are all human beings who are deserving of equal treatment under the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms are not isolated initiatives with only a transitory impact on the lives of people with a disability. They go considerably further than that. They are the foundations of this Government's vision for a fair and more just society where people with a disability are equal participants. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) here because he made some quite scathing remarks this morning when I suggested that there were people in our community who had no choice in the way in which their lives were shaped&mdash;determined by the time they got up or the time they went to bed or, in fact, what they ate and how they ate it. I suggest to him, as I suggested to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), that they could perhaps go and visit a number of places where this is happening in the Australia of the 1990s because of people's paternalistic view of some in our community as being less than equal and undeserving of even that kind of treatment. To suggest that there are not such people in our community is to have one's head in the sand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These kinds of reforms and this kind of legislation are forcing the community to raise its consciousness, to look at the kind of society that we want. Indeed, this also raises the practical issues such as physical accessibility; we have pointed out that there is traditional conservatism and a reluctance by some people in the community to consider working alongside anyone who they believe may be a little different or who has particular needs. This is the result sometimes not of ill will but of our recent history of tucking people away&mdash;the isolationist approach referred to by the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling). It was a case of `out of sight, out of mind'; as a community we absolved ourselves of responsibility for involvement in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important to remember that there is also a tremendous amount of goodwill out there. Opinions are waiting to be changed and opportunities are there to be taken up. I am sure that by working together through this legislation we can achieve a world in which people with a disability can participate in the life of the community in which they live to the degree that they wish and in which individual differences are acknowledged and accepted; a world in which people with a disability are regarded as ordinary citizens with the same rights as any other citizen and with recourse to systems to redress any infringements of those rights; a world in which people with a disability can gain and hold meaningful employment that provides wages and career opportunities that reflect performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this Disability Discrimination Bill the Labor Government looks to the creation of a fair and just society in which all people irrespective of needs have access to what many citizens take for granted and have access to opportunities so that their full potential can be realised. </PARA>

The honourable member did not seem to be as excited in her last eight minutes as she was in her over the top remarks in the way that she explained herself earlier today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I was disappointed with the honourable member for Forde, on the other hand I can easily praise the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling). The honourable member for Forde continues to make remarks about equality with dignity. But she should look at the record of her Government on equality with dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go any further, I probably should explain my role with disabled people. For 10 years I have worked with mildly and severely disabled people. For six of those years I was the president of our local adult unit and school. I was responsible for the biggest and most successful integration program in Victoria. We were so successful that we integrated every child in our junior section, and we no longer have that facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take that a step further and explain that facility. We had gathered around us the most competent instructors&mdash;people involved in cohesion of families and children with disabilities; people who were called upon by government agencies; people who were called upon by the families; people who were called upon by people such as me taking a voluntary role on behalf of disabled people&mdash;and we disbanded them throughout the education department in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My only fear when I mention integration is that as the honourable member for Corinella I will one day be called upon by the community, because of what the Government has put in place across Victoria, to create another institution like Minibah. My concerns are not just those of one person who worked within the field but of many of the people that I deal with who are struggling on a daily basis with integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forde talks about a fair and just society. But is it a fair and just society when the numbers of homeless people in Melbourne are swelled because those that have been taken out of institutions find themselves on the streets? One can talk to the community police in Victoria, anywhere from Dandenong through Melbourne out to the western suburbs, and one will find that that is the case, tragic though it is. In some cases the removal of the institutions that were put in place has caused tragedy within families and in the lives of individuals. We have thrown on to our police forces people who are not the norm. People within the police forces, untrained, are unable to cope with the situations that they face. We tried using the community police forces on different occasions for some of the people who were sent to our centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the honourable member for Lilley, I am not going to go into individual cases, because the parents of those children and adults will know exactly who I am talking about, and I do not want to cause them any distress. But I can tell honourable members that as a volunteer president of that organisation&mdash;hands-on, I say to the honourable member for Forde&mdash;I had some very difficult times dealing with people. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first began the de-institutionalisation of people with disabilities in Victoria, the first people that arrived on our doorstep had mild disabilities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It changed my life to have to deal with people with severe disabilities. I was not able to cope, yet I saw a complete staff around me move the way they thought&mdash;what they did and how they approached people. We were able to do our very best with many of the clients in our care. Hopefully we were able to change their lives. But, in fact, we even had some people that we could not cope with at our centre&mdash;a centre that had never had a locked door. But we are not here today to talk about the problems that the honourable member for Forde has, so I will return to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the feelings of the honourable member for Lilley when she presents the problems that face her in her electorate. I agree with much of what the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) put forward in the debate. I agree with the first proposal by the Government to introduce national legislation to make discrimination against people with disabilities unlawful; I have no problem with that. It aims to eliminate as far as possible discrimination on the grounds of disability in the areas of work, accommodation, education, clubs, sport, the provision of goods, facilities, services and land, existing laws and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. Harassment will also be unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `disability' covers physical, sensory, intellectual and psychiatric impairment, mental illness or disorder and the presence in the body of organisms causing or capable of causing disease. This includes past, present, future and imputed disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that debate on the Disability Discrimination Bill has been wide ranging. But we have to look, as we did in the centre that I was closely associated with, at the outcomes and what is achievable. Much of what the honourable member for Forde said I have heard and been part of for 10 years of my life. But for some there are great difficulties in achieving the outcome that we all so desire&mdash;for people to have more opportunities. But, when we take people with disabilities out into the workplace and say to an employer, `Can you please give our people with disabilities a job?', we have problems. Do honourable members know what is the greatest area of discrimination that we face in Australia today when we try to integrate those people in the workplace? It is unemployment; it is one million people unemployed and another one million underemployed. An employer says to me, `Look, Russell, I have 300 people on my books, and you want us to take on a person with a disability when we do not know what that person may or may not be able to achieve in this workplace'. So the greatest discrimination today arises from the fact that there are so many people&mdash;able-bodied, with disabilities, or whatever&mdash;who have a real problem in gaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that it was difficult through the 1980s, even when our employment levels were not as tragic as they are today. But now the outlook for jobs for people with disabilities is horrific. We have put so many disincentives in the way of people with disabilities who are trying to get employment. The reason I would like this Bill to go to a committee for decent assessment is that I want to make sure that we are not putting another disincentive in the way of people with disabilities so that they will never have the opportunity to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak for a moment about the introduction of legislation into this House and how the outcome affects people. It is not only for honourable members to take note of this; it is also for every person that has something to do with this legislation, regardless of the role he or she plays. I refer to a letter written by an American presidential hopeful, George McGovern. After losing the Watergate election campaign, he entered into the business world and subsequently went bankrupt. In a letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asian Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>, he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this first-hand experience about the difficulties business people face every day . . . I lived with federal, State and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and they could be disabled employees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that could be for special schools or adult units&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">protecting customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I add: can we continue to make business pay for the deficit of this Budget that we have experienced? He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've witnessed first-hand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for every negative experience in life. In short, `one-size-fits-all' rules for business ignore the realities of the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I would like this Bill to go to a committee for better scrutiny is that I am afraid that it is another Bill that will put impediments in the way of people with disabilities. `One size fits all' legislation, such as the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992, is inappropriate these days when there are a number of laws in Australia that prevent people being discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent all the people in my electorate of Corinella and, as a member of this House, I represent the people of Australia. It weighed heavily on me when at a breakfast this morning the speaker said, `I'm speaking to the leaders of the nation'. It is about time we looked at the legislation that we put through and made sure it benefits those people it affects. As an administrator of people with disabilities, I lived through and watched the bureaucracy in my area grow by tens and then hundreds and yet there was not one further dollar given to the people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Forde mentioned again that the mobility allowance is up by $5 a week. One day when</PARA>
<PARA>I was in my office, representatives from the Kirner-Cain State Government said, `We want a share of the mobility allowance'. But I said, `That's federal funding'. They said, `No'. My understanding of a mobility allowance is that it is to help those people with disabilities go to the football or participate in life the way those of us who do not have disabilities take for granted. The representatives of the State Government said, `No, we are going to take it out of your transport fund for your buses, Russell. You are going to have to cut down your bus routes'. That would mean that two of my disabled people would not be able to catch that bus unless their parent, guardian or someone in their community took them to as far as the bus could go. These were Federal funds given directly to the people who were part of my care&mdash;we were equal&mdash;the people that I was working with. The funds were being taken off them by the State Government in an area unrelated to this disability allowance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When George McGovern found out that his business was eventually wrecked, he blamed all the rules and regulations that he had put in place and that he thought were cosy and careful. Here is another Bill that is going to cost $5.5m to implement over two years, I think. Business will carry the costs; government will carry the costs. It will come out of the deficit that was announced yesterday. I have to note that by accident, I think, the actual deficit figure was announced by the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), before the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already discriminate, as a matter of course, against a number of people in our community. When I arrived at a school at 9 o'clock the other day, there was a parent there with a young child. She said to the principal of the school, `May my son come back to school?'. She explained the disease that he was suffering at the time. He said, `Yes, I think it is all right'. He looked at me and, being a parent, I thought I would jump in. I said, `From my knowledge of this disease I think it is all right for him to come back, too', which was totally outrageous. He said, `Having regard to the fact that you're a politician, Russell, I'd better go and check the documents'. So the principal diligently checked the documents and came back to the young boy and said, `You're not allowed back to school. We have to discriminate against you at this particular time because you've got a certain disease and you're not allowed within the school group until another week has passed by. Then you can come back to school'. Obviously the boy was very disappointed. He would have been five or six years of age. His mum was not too happy either because she had another week of having this young boy at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we discriminate now in regard to infectious diseases in schools and exclusions from schools. What they can and cannot do is all documented. In my opinion, we discriminate every day because we as employers decide whom we want to work for us and what they can and cannot do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that anybody who by misfortune has to spend his or her working life in a wheelchair and has the same abilities as somebody with legs should have equal access to a job, and I would support that. That is another reason why I want this Bill to go to a Senate committee. I want to make sure that we do not have another situation similar to what happened this morning, when I was handed 53 changes to the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992, put together by the Government people&mdash;53 amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government. Does this tell me that the Government has already made 53 mistakes? There are three notes at the bottom of this document as well. If there are 53 problems with the Bill as it stands at the moment, surely we should stand up and say that this has got to go to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am finding that 20 minutes is not long enough to speak in this House on an issue as important as this. There are other parts of the legislation regarding de facto spouses and defining associates and who under this legislation will be able to live with whom, and what facilities will be provided by the Government. That time is not given to us in this House. That is why we have a committee system, and that is why this Bill needs to go to a select committee. I ask the House to support the amendments before the Chair at this time so that we can dissect this Bill to see how every clause will affect those it is intended to help. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess that one judges a society by how it treats its aged, its youth and its disadvantaged. In this situation I think Australia, contrary to the views expressed widely on both sides of this House, does not do too badly. By world standards Australia is a pretty fair-minded country and, while there is clearly room for improvement, I do not think it serves any purpose to denigrate us. The great British philosopher Bertrand Russell once observed that to treat unequals equally is discrimination. But no less is it discrimination to treat equals unequally. People have been talking here today about treating people equally. It is, of course, a nonsense concept. People need to be treated appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record my own reasons for speaking today. I am not proud of my effort. When I put my name down to speak on the Disability Discrimination Bill it was some time ago, and the Bill did slip my mind. I did not look at it, and I am not on any appropriate committees. I am, quite frankly, not impressed with the Bill. I, however, will not be voting against it because, as the Bill says, it is not going to be a particularly expensive measure. It is not going to achieve very much and, therefore, in my view, it is not in the short term going to do a lot of damage either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think honourable members on both sides of the House have completely misread the intent of this Bill. It has very little to do with treatment of the disabled or the disadvantaged; it has everything to do with expanding the power of people such as Irene Moss and Brian Burdekin, who run the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. These people are in my view an abomination on society, and hopefully one day a government will have enough courage to sweep them away. I do not see that resolve in my own Government, and I certainly do not see it in the Opposition. This Bill is a heyday for the social engineers, those people who have already done so much damage in society. I recognise this. I will not be voting against this Bill because I find myself overwhelmed with other issues and, frankly, I cannot bear the pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we ought to think about treating people appropriately, and I want to talk about some of my own experiences. In my youth I was engaged in an industry manufacturing budgie toys. We were invaded in those days by one of the low wage countries of the world, Japan. It was landing budgie toys in Australia assembled at rates we could not compete with. To compete, I organised groups of people in the community to assemble these toys for which they were paid, albeit on fairly low wages, on a piecework basis. One lad that I was encouraged to give a job to was mentally retarded, intellectually handicapped quite severely, but he certainly had an ability to assemble these toys. By his dexterity, he made reasonable, passable money out of doing this assembly work and felt terribly pleased with himself. He was absolutely devastated when we were no longer able to provide him with the work. It was probably the only meaning he had ever had in his life. He was employed not out of compassion but competitively because he was good at what he did. It is quite clear that many disadvantaged people are very competent in what they do, and they are employed on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a friend who is involved in a private employment agency. She says that she has no trouble placing disadvantaged people who, on their merits, can hold down positions. There are some companies in Australia that have made a policy of employing disadvantaged people over some time. They do this, I guess, as a sort of community service. I was talking to the manager of one of these companies yesterday when I realised that this Bill was upon me. He said that, while it was the policy of that company, it was a very serious cost because many of these people that they employed were not good employees. This company made a habit of employing people who had undergone withdrawal treatment for drugs&mdash;people who had been hooked on drugs of various sorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the firm found these people to be unreliable. People who had poor work records for various reasons were found to be poor attenders. People with intellectual ability seemed to have no shortage of ability in avoiding work. When we talk, as this Bill does, about costs in the United States of $1,000 per employee, I suspect it is simply for physical infrastructure to aid that employee. As this fellow said to me, the real cost is in the employee one has to employ to supervise these people. So it is not a situation where one can generalise, as most speakers have done. I have sat here today listening to speakers on both sides sanctimoniously prattling their platitudes and their stained-glass attitudes about this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a boy who is diabetic. Diabetes is a real problem in the community. The impairments caused by it are its limitations. In his case it ties him to two injections a day. He said to me recently, as he has just turned 17 and is looking for a driving licence, `The police would not give me my L plates because I am a diabetic, and I have to get a letter from my doctor. The police would know all about diabetes!' Would the police be guilty of discrimination? I think not. I think the police action was appropriate. People with diabetes can be a danger on the road under certain circumstances. If the police are not sure of the ramifications, of course it is sensible to discriminate in that respect against people with diabetes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told in the Bill that people who cannot read should not be discriminated against in employment because there may be a job cleaning windows. I put it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in society today everyone should be able to read. It is an indictment of the school system when people fail to be able read. It may be that there are a few people with an intellectual ability which, although they are otherwise completely able, makes them unable to read. I myself have a similar disability, due in part to the education system. I like to blame the education system because otherwise I would have to blame my intellectual capacity. I am unable to spell. I am amongst the world's worst spellers. I have absolutely no grasp of the grammar of the English language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should I be discriminated against if I seek a position to instruct people in the mysteries of the English language?  Of course I should. It is absurd nonsense to suggest that I should not be. I am not suggesting that the Bill goes that far, but it is an extension of the logic which we are being touched with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the education system throughout this country, one finds that the greatest single need is for more remedial teaching in primary schools because if kids get through primary school without learning the basics of reading and English they are doomed for the rest of their lives. In being doomed, they impose a great cost on society. I believe that if we are genuine in approaching this business of discrimination we should be looking to ensure that remedial facilities are available in the schools. They are not at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an indictment of the teachers union in my State that it fights for the State Government to spend millions of dollars removing asbestos from the roofs in schools, which poses no health threat whatsoever&mdash;and that has been scientifically proven&mdash;but it does not fight for remedial teachers. The several million dollars that the State school teachers union has cost the Government in asbestos removal would have been much better employed giving some equality in education. This applies disproportionately to people in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to look at the great discrimination that goes on against people who live in the remote areas of this country. Ironically, it is these areas which create the wealth of the cities, but they do not enjoy the facilities of the cities. Even though it is the country areas which create the reason for the cities' existence, we continually discriminate against people in remote areas. Both parties are guilty of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of great concern to me is the number of people who are brain damaged through trauma on the road or for other reasons. I know that the Minister has been approached by Dr Ted Freeman, a man who has had considerable success in the rehabilitation of these people. I can think of no more horrendous experience than being a captive in one's own body. Yet what does society do for these people?  We prefer to keep them in a hospital situation under total care and often living like vegetables, when many of them would respond to some remedial treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of life's other little ironies is that giving these people treatment would in fact be the cheapest remedy for society. It would be much better for the individuals to be free from the bondage of their own bodies and it would increase the quality of their lives. It would also at the same time reduce the costs on the Government. There is nothing in this Bill that even addresses that matter. It is something that has never crossed the minds of the likes of Moss and Burdekin. If we are serious and if we are genuine, it is about time we looked at putting some funding into doing something for these very unfortunate people who are today a product of our society. We have a motor car culture and these people are a consequence of that. I believe that society should be doing a lot more for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, honourable members have also spoken about the right to work. There is no right to work. It was a slogan adopted by the Australian Labor Party that the Labor Party would give and recognise that right to work. Throughout the world there is no right to work. I believe it is an enviable situation where people have an opportunity to work. Until we address the matter of an industry policy that recognises a need for manufacturing in this country, there is going to be no right to work because there will never be a situation again where we have full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have?  We have the Government not really addressing this problem at all and we have the Liberal Party still transfixed by the level playing field and unable to have even the remotest idea of how we can get manufacturing industry working in this country. There are obviously costs in doing what we can and this Bill imposes some costs. It is clearly society's responsibility and, if we have that fair society which we all aspire to, everyone in that society who is able to do so should contribute to the welfare and betterment of the position of the disabled. It is therefore irrational and illogical to put this cost on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are as a government trying desperately on the one hand, through micro-economic reform, to make the workplace more efficient and to take costs off employers and, on the other, we are putting costs back on. I believe that we should be looking to incorporate disabled people in the work force wherever we can. One must bear in mind that not all handicapped people require this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find inspiration in people such as Stephen Hawkins, one of the world's great intellects, who is afflicted with a disease that is slowly paralysing his mind and his body but he has done revolutionary work in astronomy and has carried that message to ordinary people. Stephen Hawkins is a man who makes me feel extremely humble. It should be recognised that many people with infirmities and disabilities show enormous courage in overcoming them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But however much courage they display on some occasions, handicapped people can never aspire to be as efficient as somebody who is simply unafflicted. Therefore, they are going to be more expensive to employ because they are going to be less productive in some cases, although there are some cases in which I believe they are more productive. I have been told that there is quite a demand for employing blind people as telephonists. These positions are probably going to be made redundant as technology advances, but it is an area in which they are very competent and efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not always the case. Is it fair that we should ask the employer to bear the burden of this?  I think that it is most unfair. It is a burden that society should bear. I suspect that that cost could best be distributed to society through the tax system with people getting workable discounts for employing people under these conditions. I do not think there is any argument about the responsibility that society bears. Anyone who tries to avoid this responsibility is simply passing the buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate that this Bill is largely a Bill designed to increase the power of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Both we as a government and those opposite as an opposition are beholden to these pressure groups. I believe that these groups and the social engineers which accompany them are doing enormous damage to the fabric of Australian society with no real gains. We ought to be looking at this very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I said, I lack the courage to vote against this legislation because I have other pressures and other things that I am working on. But I hope that one day we will get a government in this country with sufficient courage to sweep away all this nonsense and return Australia to a proud, competent country and, in my view, a country that has a history of being compassionate. That is the Australia that I aspire to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The things we are doing today in this Bill work against the very thing that we all say we aspire to. What we need to do in society is to make sure that people who have disabilities have every possible help. For example, prostheses should be available whenever they are needed. We should not stint on that at all. Australia could easily be at the forefront in the provision of this equipment. However, what has happened with kangaroo leather which is the lightest leather the world?  When one talks about making orthopaedic shoes, there is nothing comparable with kangaroo leather; it is by far the best. But do we have a manufacturing industry in this country utilising this very valuable raw material&mdash;this renewable resource?  The answer is:  only to a very limited degree. Every attempt to do so is met with opposition. I have probably spoken for too long in this debate because I believe that my contribution will be welcomed by neither my Government nor the Opposition. </PARA>

One way or another that is where it will end up, because that is where the Opposition plans for it to go for proper consideration. Those things happen in the Senate.

I cannot see why the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), knowing that that process will happen, whether he likes it or not, would not give us in the House of Representatives an opportunity to participate in that important committee process. It shows the way this Government operates. The fact that it would exclude me from participating is beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has a number of concerns with this legislation. All of those concerns have been expressed by our speakers so far in this debate. That is why we have chosen to move this amendment, which I strongly support, for the matter to be referred to a joint parliamentary committee. As many honourable members, not least the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, have said, this is a very sensitive and emotive area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community attitudes to the disabled vary enormously. Generally I believe that most people support the principle, and so they should, that disabled people should not be discriminated against. I think many people would go further and suggest that if there is to be discrimination, it should be in favour of those who are disabled. None of us has any problem with the concept that disabled people should be enabled, wherever possible, to live meaningful and worthwhile lives and that they should not miss out on the opportunities and pleasures which are experienced and enjoyed by the general population. None of us would have any problems with those principles. Unfortunately, Government members do not seem to recognise that the position is not as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons why disabled people cannot do certain things, and it is much to their detriment. As I meet many of these people, I am surprised at how wonderfully adjusted they are to their situations, but there are reasons why they are unable to do certain things or are prevented from doing certain things. If anyone wants to say that that is discrimination&mdash;a word with all sorts to connotations&mdash;I guess it is just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not help. If anything, it makes the situation more complicated than it ought to be. In this Government's headlong rush to present itself in this legislation as caring&mdash;that is the word of the last 24 hours&mdash;it is laying a veritable minefield for those whom it is attempting to help. That is so typical of this Government. Too much of the legislation that we have seen has been an overreaction and an attempt to solve a problem which often does not exist. We have been faced with legislation after legislation which has what has quaintly become known as unintended consequences, or problems that have to be sorted out down the line, or amendments that are necessary to fix some problem that was never envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister spoke of social justice, human rights and all the sorts of things that give Labor members a warm inner glow. These are the sorts of things the Labor Party loves to talk about. As the Minister said in his speech, the legislation is an attempt to change attitudes. If ever there was a fundamental reason for not bringing in legislation, it would be that reason. Our experience everywhere tells us that changes in attitudes cannot be legislated. Changes in attitudes are more a matter for the process of education than of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many instances in this area where legislation has been positively unhelpful or counterproductive. I recall the result of the Richmond report into certain New South Wales hospitals which eventually were closed down. It caused great distress to the disabled people, especially to young people and their parents. That was an example of legislation or government activity which seemed to be enlightened turning out to be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any real need for this legislation? That is where we have some serious doubts. There is already a plethora of legislation on a State level in this area. Serious doubts exist in our minds about the rationale for this. What is the Government's real motivation for introducing this legislation now in the run-up to the next election? In my view, its motivation is very doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister says it is timely. He puts it in the context of the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. Interestingly, the Minister goes on to say that it is another significant step in fulfilling our international obligations under the United Nations. Personally at least, I do not disagree with what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was saying about those obligations. Many people have told me that they are concerned about that process under which, without reference to Parliament, we agree to a range of protocols and conventions. The Minister listed them in his speech. Having so embarked on a process of committing ourselves to those, we then have to proceed with a range of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these protocols are not entirely appropriate to the Australian situation. Recently we had limited debate in the Parliament, but a more extensive debate in the community, about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are still serious doubts and reservations in the community about the applicability of that to the Australian situation, and whether it was even wise for us to agree to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is flawed in some more significant and fundamental ways than just on the bases I have already mentioned. It certainly canvasses some important issues. Honourable members on both sides of the House have agreed that that is the case. In fact, it is so important that our amendment says that this is a very important issue. It needs to be given further consideration rather than just accepting what the Government dishes out in a headlong rush into something as important as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very serious concerns among a number of people and organisations within the community at this time. Perhaps this matter should be capable of complete bipartisan support. Disabled people should not be political footballs. But let us get this right if we really wish to help the disabled. Let us remove the obvious social engineering agenda and the ideology that is involved. Let us get down to some practical solutions to problems which really do exist rather than ones the Government attempts to create and then goes about solving. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk briefly about some of the problems that I believe exist with this legislation. The Australian Medical Association has expressed concern about the definition of `disability'. The Minister in his second reading speech said this includes HIV and AIDS. The AMA said this definition is inappropriate and needs revision in the light of scientific knowledge. Scientifically, the AMA said, this definition is untenable and it makes the point that virtually all Australians are presently carrying organisms in their bodies capable of causing disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an important matter. What has the Government done in that regard? It has done nothing. There is no attempt to take account of that important point in the definition of what a disability is. One suspects, in reading that, that it is a thinly veiled attempt to pander to the AIDS lobby. That is crass in terms of the naming of this legislation and the emotion that is built up in talking about people with disabilities. Yet this is slipped in almost to catch us off-guard. Of course, the AMA makes reference to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear: it is an important point and it warrants careful investigation. There may well be a case for discrimination against people with AIDS. That may apply in respect of some employment. It certainly applies, in my view, in respect of some sporting activities. The case involving a footballer has already been talked about today. I say `may' because there is still, in respect of the transmission of HIV, in my opinion and from the reading I have done on the subject, a lot of the unknown and there is still a great deal of concern in the community about this matter. Some of that concern has been shown to have been misguided, but some is warranted. Yet we have this thrust upon us without any due consideration of the AMA's position on it, and I believe without any due consideration of the concern that exists in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Confederation of Australian Industry is quite categorical in its criticism of the legislation. It states that it does not consider there is a need for such legislation and it points to already substantial practical difficulties that can result from statutory prohibitions on indirect discrimination. The CAI, as a peak employer body, also has concerns about the onus of proof established under this legislation. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be no obligation on the employer to in effect prove conduct to be reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, having regard to this advice and, I believe, this perfectly valid position, the Government has failed to take account of that in the framing of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Institute of Victoria has expressed concerns regarding the Bill. It believes that the Bill should be redrafted clearly to impose the burden of proving unjustifiable hardship upon the respondent seeking to claim it. The Government's response to that suggestion is to press on regardless. That is why this legislation boils down to being sheer politics, in my view. It makes political footballers, as I said, of those whose interests this caring Government wants to stand up and claim it is representing. Surely, there is an unambiguous case in what we have presented. In the spirit of the debate that has been carried on in this place throughout the day, there is a case for caution; there is a case for further consideration; there is a case for reference to a joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter of great concern to many members of the Opposition is the definition of `associate'. In the original draft of the Bill `de facto spouse' included in that relationship, as others on this side have said in the debate, for the first time in the history of this country reference to the fact that people should be regarded as de facto whether or not they are of the same sex. At least the Government accepted representations in respect of that and this has now been amended to delete `de facto spouse' and include the quaint word `associate'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was talking about the Disability Discrimination Bill and speaking particularly in support of our amendment which calls for a joint committee inquiry into this matter. One other great concern to many members of the Opposition is the definition of `associate' in this legislation. I said before dinner that the original draft of the Bill referred to a `de facto spouse'. Within that context, it was defined as a relationship `whether or not the people concerned are of the same sex'. The Minister, to his credit, has at least taken the step of removing that reference; that attempt to put a relationship between two homosexual people on the same level as a normal family relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this quaint word `associate' has now been inserted. But I wonder whether this is an exercise in semantics. We now find that an associate is `a person living with another person on a genuine domestic basis'. Implicitly, that could be two people of the same sex living in a relationship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is dreadful. If the honourable member for Moreton is going to stand up here and tell us what the Labor Party believes in, let him admit that the Labor Party is taking us down this track by stealth in this legislation. It is doing it dishonestly. It is hiding behind this legislation which has had so much importance placed upon it. That is our criticism of this legislation and our concern about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a thinly veiled attempt to promote homosexual relationships as some form of acceptable alternative lifestyle. That is what the Government is on about and it ought to be ashamed of itself. It is trying to make a homosexual relationship somehow equal to a family, in the normally accepted sense of this word. In my view, this is a very dangerous path to go down. It threatens the very fibre of our society and it must be resisted. Even the Family Law Act, with all of its problems, weaknesses and limitations, does not go that far and nor should it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we may have compassion for homosexuals and we may not wish them to be discriminated against in their unfortunate situation, the unchangeable fact is&mdash;and let the honourable member for Moreton tell me otherwise&mdash;that homosexual relationships are not normal. They should not be condoned, encouraged or, worse, recognised in law. That is what the Government is trying to do. It has been caught out here. It has stepped back from including this sort of relationship in what it calls a `de facto relationship' and it now calls it, quaintly, an `associate relationship'. I challenge the honourable member to refute that that is the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have said consistently in this debate, there is need for further consideration of this legislation. We are concerned about the Government's motivation in bringing this legislation before the House and attempting to slam it through despite the strong logical concerns of reputable organisations such as the AMI, the CAI, the Law Society of Victoria and a number of others. We do not dispute the need for us to address this important issue, but we object to what the Government has lumped into the legislation. I have referred to a number of those things tonight. We believe the Government is doing a great disservice to those whom it is talking about caring for by lumping in these other matters and disguising them behind what we think is a very important issue. </PARA>

What it will be preventing is the opportunity for those of us who are members of this House of Parliament&mdash;the people's House of Parliament&mdash;to participate in that important process of consideration. I say to the Government: please give us that opportunity. This is an important matter. People with disabilities are important and their concerns are important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I have said, I am proud to stand here today and support the disability discrimination legislation because I think it is a fine piece of legislation and it is fundamental to the Government's objective of social justice for all. The Disability Discrimination Bill represents yet another watershed in the Government's continuing endeavours to promote social justice for people with a disability. But what do we mean by social justice? Social justice is the fair distribution of economic resources, equal rights, fair access to essential services, and participation by individuals in making the decisions which affect their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how do we translate these ideals into policies that will make a difference to the lives of individuals? Time and again during the last decade the Labor Party has gone out of its way to translate these ideals into practical policies. We have listened to those people who have been most disadvantaged, to those whose voices have long been suppressed, and to those who have much to say but have previously had little opportunity to be heard. We have gone out of our way to bring together disparate groups and unite this country and break down the barriers that create divisions among us. In short, our aim is to be one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that everyone has certain basic rights. We want all Australians to have a quality of life which allows them to make their own choices and develop to their own full potential. We recognise that all have a contribution to make and that we can all benefit from sharing with others. This makes us richer as individuals and as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with a disability are a particular group who have not always received their fair share. They are a group who have not always had control over their own lives and who have not always had access to the facilities they need to enable them to reach their full potential. They have been held back, often not through any fault of their own but because of the limited imagination of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an unprecedented series of consultations during the handicapped programs review, which was established in 1983, this Government asked people with a disability what they wanted&mdash;what would make a difference. Their response was clear and unequivocal. `We are people first', they said, `not the disabled, not patients, and certainly not objects of charity'. The disability groups said, `We want jobs, homes and a chance to live an ordinary life like other Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to that point the focus of government policies had been the provision of institutional care and sheltered workshops. These services had played an important role in meeting many of the basic needs of people with a disability and the needs of their families. However, the Labor Government recognised that people with a disability deserved better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This set the scene for a series of widespread reforms. These included the Disability Services Act introduced in 1986, the disability reform package announced in 1990 and the Commonwealth-State disability agreement signed in 1991, to name just a few of the more significant reforms which this Government has introduced. These reforms provide a model for how principles of social justice can be translated into policies which enable some of the most disadvantaged people within our community to participate as full and equal citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has this been achieved? Firstly, our policies have been directed towards equity. By this, I mean that we have sought to ensure that there is fairness in the way our economic resources are distributed. For people with a disability this can be graphically illustrated by the implementation of the disability reform package. The aim of this package is to improve the participation of people with a disability in employment, education and training activities and to make it easier for people with a disability to participate in, and contribute to, the life and work of the community. Further, the package makes sure that people who have severe disabilities and who have limited job prospects get adequate and secure income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Labor Government there have been record increases in funding for disability services: from a funding level of $104m in 1983 to a figure of $314m in the 1991-92 financial year. This represents an increase of over 60 per cent in real terms and a threefold improvement in dollar terms towards the provision of practical support for people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, our policies promote equality. Equal, effective and comprehensive civil, legal and industrial rights are a fundamental tenet of the Labor Party. It has been implicit in all our policies and has been particularly manifested in relation to our equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we aim to ensure that there is fair and equal access to services. We have sought to provide people with real choices and services that meet their individual needs. It is this aim which is clearly set out in the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act. This Act has encouraged a move towards smaller services focused on the needs of individuals. It provides for a move away from institutional solutions towards community based options and it seeks to promote access to mainstream services. Under the Act, a wider range of service options can be offered and innovation in service delivery can be encouraged. Currently an unprecedented number of people with a disability receive support under Commonwealth funded programs and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, we want everyone to have an opportunity to participate in, and contribute to, the life and work of our community. We are particularly focusing on jobs in recognition of the increased opportunities that employment provides for people to participate in community life and to obtain an increased share of the nation's economic resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has signalled that disadvantaged groups, such as people with a disability, can no longer be cast outside the employment mainstream of this country. We are promoting access to open employment through policies such as the disability reform package, the provision of employment and rehabilitation places and awareness raising strategies targeted towards employers, unions and co-workers. The Government recognises that these measures are part of an ongoing process of reform to bring about real and enduring change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fitting that the Government now turns its attention to promoting the rights of people with a disability in the wider community through the Disability Discrimination Bill. The Bill before us tonight will ensure that the reforms continue to permeate at all levels of society by promoting social justice through education and reconciliation. The Disability Discrimination Bill is further evidence that the Labor Government is hearing and listening to the voice of people with a disability and acting upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate how this legislation will make a difference, I would like to outline something about the origins of the Bill. In 1990 the Government commissioned a report to examine a number of barriers to work force participation for people with a disability and steps that could be taken to remove the obstacles. The report, known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Employment Initiatives for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS>, prepared by Sydney barrister Chris Ronalds, identified a number of major barriers to employment which remained largely untouched despite prior initiatives. These included employer and co-worker attitudes, access to premises and transport and the types of job and job design. In particular, the report highlighted the need for national discrimination legislation. During consultations on the report, many people gave examples of how they were denied an opportunity to contribute to the work force because of the attitude and misconceptions of employers and co-workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some examples. Many people told how they had experienced arriving at an interview and, once the employer or the interviewing committee observed that they had a physical or sensory disability, the tone and content of the interview changed and interest quickly waned. One particular job applicant was told during a preliminary telephone interview that his qualifications and experience were appropriate and was invited to come to an interview. Upon inquiring about wheelchair access, the call was abruptly terminated by the employer. It was also reported that many co-workers questioned the right of a person with a disability to have a job when they were entitled to a pension and they were taking the jobs of `proper' workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with hidden disabilities are also often disadvantaged. Many people with psychiatric disabilities find it difficult to obtain a job, even if they have not had a period of hospitalisation for some years. As one person put it during consultations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I am honest with potential employers, I fail to get an offer of employment and if I conceal my disability and am later found out, I am dismissed unfairly without appeal.</PARA>
<PARA>In further consultations conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, people with a disability have related examples of discrimination in almost every area of community life. These include the areas of employment, accommodation, education, clubs, sport, the provision of goods, facilities, services and land and existing laws&mdash;areas which are all covered in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has continued to consult with people with a disability throughout the process of drawing up the legislation to ensure that their views can be taken into account. During these consultations, people with a disability have overwhelmingly supported the legislation and there has also been widespread support across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation covers all areas that it is feasible for us to incorporate in the legislation. There are, however, two areas where we have made exemptions because of arrangements that were already in place before the drafting of the Disability Discrimination Bill. These exemptions are in relation to telecommunications and migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a three-year exemption for telecommunications carriers which is designed to allow time for the implementation of reforms presently under way in the telecommunications industry. This exemption is in line with government commitments in relation to these reforms and binding arrangements that had been made in respect of the second carrier. It should be noted that the exemption applies only to the carriers in their role as service providers, not as employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, telecommunications carriers, together with other service providers, will, however, have the option of developing voluntary action plans which provide for a gradual planned approach to meeting the principles contained in the legislation, and which can be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in the short term the legislation will not address the immediate access needs of people with a disability to telecommunications services; however, the legislation does promote slow and gradual change which will result in real benefits to people with a disability over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that, in recognition of the difficulties faced by people with severe speech and hearing impediments in gaining access to the telecommunications system, a decision was taken in this month's Budget to undertake a 12-month examination of the feasibility of a national telephone-typewriter relay service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption in relation to migration reflects the fact that the Migration Act 1958 and the regulations made under that Act already incorporate review procedures which relate to the migration of people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with a disability know that while there are many in the community with good intentions, this is not enough. As one person has said, goodwill alone does not provide enforceable protection against discrimination. The Federal Labor Government has listened to the people with disabilities and is responding in a way that is bringing about tangible benefits for people with a disability. We recognise that people with a disability want to have a go. They should not be handicapped because of the attitudes of others and ignorance and fears within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with a disability have had their say. What they ask for cannot be denied by any fair-minded, thinking Australian. The Disability Discrimination Bill goes right to the heart of the Government's commitment to social justice for all Australians. It shows this commitment is more than mere rhetoric. I believe we can all recognise that this legislation brings us another step forward as a nation by striving to improve the position of those who have been among the most disadvantaged in the past. I therefore urge all to give this Bill full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with considerable concern to support the Opposition's amendment to the Disability Discrimination Bill. The Opposition wants the Government, and more importantly the Parliament, to go away and look at all the implications of what this legislation proposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Were we now debating a motion of this House condemning, if you like, discrimination in the workplace or anywhere else against disabled people, I would be the first to stand and speak in favour of such a motion. The fact is, of course, that we are not doing that. We are debating specific legislation attempting to bureaucratise a real issue in our community. It is not the first time the Parliament has chosen to do this;  it will not be the last. I guess we have a little problem. We see ourselves as law makers and we are too frequently the victims of a bureaucracy that stands to gain substantially from measures of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many decades, many centuries, family matters remained the responsibility of the family. It would not be the first time that I have advised this House that my mother was one of 13 children. It could certainly have been called a financially disadvantaged family, yet I have a recollection as a very young child of a family discussion relating to family violence. My mother just happened to inform my father in a very casual way during dinner that, in fact, two of her brothers had called around to see her sister's husband on account of the fact that he was not treating her properly. I might add that they were both of Irish background, stood about six foot two and weighed about 16 stone&mdash;I can assure you that their message would have been considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to be more serious about it. It was not a big deal in our family:  a wife had reported to members of her family that she was not properly looked after by her husband; the family took action. Honourable members can reply that that was because in those days we had a neglectful government and that it was not prepared to do anything about it. The simple fact was that that neglectful government used to consume about 14 per cent of GDP. We now have a caring government that consumes 40 per cent of GDP and, of course, the family goes to the front pages of the telephone directory for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that it is very productive because people in those circumstances frequently take these bureaucratic jobs for the purposes of their own agendas. I know we are talking about disabilities now, but I just want to make this point about our more recently formed domestic violence bureaucracy: there are people who take jobs in that area who are more concerned with breaking up marriages than making them survive. I am deeply concerned about that. I am proud to announce that I stand here as someone who has been married for 35 years and I would be a more difficult partner than most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that I worry about those things because fundamentally I believe family is a very important thing. I extend my responsibilities to my children and my grandchildren. I am the family marriage counsellor and I am proud of it&mdash;and I want to make that point. But I also want to make a point that my worry about this is that we are going too far. I am not criticising the Government for trying to do the right thing. I heard the closing remarks of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). He believes that a bureaucratic solution is the right solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was approached just recently in the area of human disability by a parent who is deeply concerned that because her severely disabled child has reached the age of maturity, is either 18 or older, although in every other respect she is a five-year-old, she has to have a legal friend, a bureaucrat, to take a proprietary interest in that child, when the mother desperately wants to continue her responsibility. I do not know anybody that loves a child more than its mother. I do not care if it is someone who is 55. Why did we implement laws that say that when somebody reaches the age that, in respect of the rest of us, gives us the right to vote and stand on our own two feet, we believe a bureaucrat is better able to conduct business or anything else on behalf of a child than one of its parents?  But that is how the law of Australia provides. I have a funny feeling we are heading off down the same track again and I am deeply concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in the Parliament before that if we want to write laws, let us write them for a good reason;  let us make sure they are fair;  and having done so, for goodness sake let us apply them. We should not make them token laws. With due respect, I sincerely hope this is a token law, that somebody is introducing it to make themselves feel good, although I see that the expenditure of a sorely pressed taxpaying community is $5.5m to make it work. Quite frequently we find when we talk to our constituents that one of the reasons that the second partner goes to work, one of the reasons that they are unable to meet their mortgages, is that the tax man takes too much. It is not a matter of whether the Government decides to borrow $13.4 billion to ease that burden. That burden is applied at a later date and living standards are constantly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more common sayings of the mother I have already referred to was that when poverty comes through the door loves flies out of the window. That is a tremendous pressure on a marriage and we should not be bringing forward to this Parliament propositions that increase people's taxes and&mdash;let me say the other half of that&mdash;reduce people's living standards if we are not going to do a lot of good with the legislation that we propose, if we just see it as some token commitment to people whom I believe are entitled to every consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the legislation proposes, taking into account what I have just said. We know that some bureaucrats will do all right because there is to be an office of Disability Discrimination Commissioner. We know that that will not be an office of one. We have already been reminded by me that the expenditure will be $5.5m. Who will be the other great beneficiaries? There is a heap of them in this place; they are called lawyers. There is a great opportunity for them to profit from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members think that that does not happen, let me give a case example. I will not use names; I will not even identify the race club with which I am involved. But it is a tragic example of what happens. A young man applied to this race club for and received indentures as an apprentice jockey. His master then discovered that he is totally deaf in one ear. Of course, a lot of things go on in horseracing, particularly in a race, including the fact that jockeys coming up behind tired horses call out for room. The master did not have any objection to this young man but he had a responsibility, as people get killed on racecourses, to refer the matter to the race club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The race club, quite responsibly, took the matter to experts. The young man was tested by ear nose and throat experts who said, `He has good hearing in one ear and bad hearing in the other ear. Unfortunately, in our professional opinion, this will affect his ability directionally to decide where noise is coming from&mdash;whether the jockey asking for room is on his right or his left'. That was the opinion of the experts. He was therefore told that he had no future in horseracing&mdash;that he could act as a strapper or as a track rider and gain a living in that area but that he would be a danger to everybody else in a race. The club had nothing against the young man, but it felt obliged to take this action in the interests of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the technical evidence I have given in that case I believe that the Minister might choose to say, `Well, we have covered that in our legislation. We have this word `reasonable' poked in here and somewhere else and we have laid down conditions'. Every time the word `reasonable' is written, another lawyer gets a job. One can debate `reasonable' in the courts of Australia until one is blue in the face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the legal profession is a little short of work at the moment, so all of a sudden this young man went off to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The club did not wish to discriminate against him, but suddenly the race club is now up for thousands of dollars in legal fees while it defends the position that it has taken in the interests, as it sees it, of protecting the lives of other jockeys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter what the outcome is from here on. The bureaucracy has got hold of this. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has got hold of it. It is funding the case and the club cannot win. I have had discussions with one of the participants about what the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission might decide about someone riding in a race with only half-hearing and the disability that that creates for the person in that situation. I wonder whether, if it finds in the young man's favour, it will give an indemnity to that race club that, if anybody gets killed by this young man, it will pay the compensation. That is a pretty fair question. I see a couple of grinning advisers over there. I wonder whether they will answer that question. In other words, what will happen if a disabled person is forced into a position where that person could put others at risk and he wins the case&mdash;probably because the employer throws his hands in the air and says simply that he will pay and take on that person rather than face the legal costs, which would run into tens of thousands of dollars&mdash;and then someone is killed by that person? That could be the case in the example I have just given. That is true; that is happening in Western Australia at the moment. Will the Minister undertake to this Parliament that in those circumstances he will take the responsibility? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employer is put out of it. The employer is an expert in his field. The turf club is an expert in its field. But it did not stop there. It did not want to discriminate against the young man. It sought other expert advice which said, `If you go on with this, someone could be killed'. It is as simple as that. Honourable members should not tell me that this does not happen because every year deaths are recorded on racecourses&mdash;probably more than in car races. It is a very serious issue. But we are going to leave that sort of judgment to people who have no idea whatsoever what it is all about. Of course, as I have already pointed out, they have another agenda&mdash;their jobs. It is pretty worrying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another objection because I happened to do a turn as the shadow Minister for health. I did so at a time when the AIDS debate was probably at its zenith. I am sympathetic with people who have contracted AIDS. I am sympathetic with people who have contracted yellow fever. But I find that this legislation again wants to discriminate between the two. We all know that yellow fever can be transmitted from person to person without any bodily contact whatsoever. So we say that that should be put aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that during the time that I mentioned a shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), came back to Australia from a yellow fever area. When he got back he was unable to produce evidence that he had been inoculated before he left. The health authorities immediately said to him that he could not travel north of a certain parallel in Australia until he had completed a quarantine period. He did not do that; he ignored their instructions. I do not support him in that because I think he was foolish. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This place has a responsibility to put up decent legislation. I presume that this legislation was primarily meant to be a vehicle to protect the interests of people who have a disability inherited at birth, through accident or something of that nature. Why should HIV sufferers suddenly be included at the end of it? Is it because somebody from gaol wanted to play football in Tasmania? Is that the reason?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is our responsibility to the community? We think that it is to protect it from yellow fever, not to protect it from AIDS when that is a much simpler procedure. In fact, we want to write laws that guarantee that people cannot be protected from AIDS in the simple manner that they would all prefer. That is what is in this legislation. It is unbelievable. So there is good reason to have some of these matters considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, industry today is very concerned about people with a long history of workers compensation claims. Whether we like it or not, there are people who trade on genuine or perceived disabilities so that they do not have to work. Anybody who wants to stand up and say that is not so is a fool. The evidence is legend. What do we do now? It appears to me that if there are 25 cases of compensation claims from a perennial bad back that gives a person prior access to a job because he has a disability. The only certainty is that that person is going to break down again and a new employer will be subject to a compensation claim and an attack on his insurance rates, et cetera. Why should a piece of legislation brought down in this Parliament create that situation? It is ridiculous. Of course, industry would bring to us a list of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure who we are talking about when we talk about service providers, but service providers have an opportunity to lodge action plans, and HREOC has outlined long term strategies to overcome perceived discriminatory practices. What are we about in this Parliament that we have to deal with perceived matters?  We are legislators; we write law. What are we talking about? While the Government tries to write this legislation, and then say that people have a reasonable excuse not to obey it, a lawyer's jungle has been created. There will be plenty of problems, and small business and others who can ill afford it will end up sacking other people to pay their legal fees. I hope the Government decides that this matter should be passed on to the committee we recommend. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill represents another key plank in this Government's endeavour to do all that it can to ensure that all Australians enjoy the same rights and fundamental freedoms. This legislation is designed to break down some of the fundamental barriers to equality of opportunity that are presently experienced by people with disabilities. Others have spoken on this Government's proud record in relation to assisting people with disabilities. I wish to look at this Bill as part of the Government's commitment to human rights for all Australians and to look at this Bill as it fulfils some of Australia's obligations under a number of international instruments. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disabled persons have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity. Disabled persons, whatever the origin, nature and seriousness of their handicaps and disabilities, have the same fundamental rights as their fellow citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost the right to enjoy a decent life, as normal and full as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>That document further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disabled persons shall be protected against all exploitation, all regulations and all treatment of a discriminatory, abusive or degrading nature.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives domestic effect to the Government's obligations under that international instrument as well as under a number of others. The Bill is but part of this Government's record of implementing human rights for all. In putting into effect each of the initiatives which make up that record, the Government has consistently relied upon the various international instruments that underpin the domestic legislative initiatives which have taken place. This legislation is of course but part of that record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like tonight to highlight a number of the Government's initiatives in this area. In my view, these initiatives show clearly how this Government is committed to social justice for all, no matter what their social or economic disadvantage. It can be said that our record stands in stark contrast to the politics of division and survival of the fittest now being preached by our political opponents. Our commitment is to build an Australia where all have equal opportunity to share in the unique benefits of being a citizen of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stimulus for Federal anti-discrimination legislation came with the Whitlam Government's enacting of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. That Act was designed to make racial discrimination unlawful and to provide that all people, notwithstanding their race, colour, national or ethnic origin, should have the same rights as all Australians to equality before the law, whether that be Federal, State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation was enacted to bring into domestic application the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It was this focus by the Labor Government of the day on Australia's international obligations that opened the door for the Commonwealth Government to play a central role in the area of ensuring domestic compliance with internationally accepted human rights. The effect of this groundbreaking legislation on educating public opinion and changing attitudes to racial discrimination has been tremendous, to say the least. I think it is fair to say that it has quite fundamentally changed the attitudes of many tens of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many argue that governments should not be involved in these areas and that education and public awareness alone are sufficient to deal with issues such as racial discrimination. Anyone who really believes in such sentiments only has to read some of the recent reports to government in areas such as racial violence, employment of people with disabilities and Aboriginal deaths in custody to realise that such programs of themselves are not enough. The law can and must play a key role in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further major Federal initiatives in the area of human rights sadly had to wait until the coming of another Labor government in 1983. In 1984, the Federal Government enacted the Sex Discrimination Act. That Act has as part of its primary purpose the elimination as far as possible of discrimination based on sex, marital status or pregnancy and to assist in eliminating discrimination involving sexual harassment. The legislation was designed to give domestic effect to Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act had a significant effect on public attitudes, particularly in the area of sexual harassment. This legislation sent a clear message to the general community that discrimination against women, and in particular sexual harassment, was not merely objectionable but, by that legislation, made unlawful in certain circumstances. For too long such discriminatory practices were looked on as simply humorous and part of the rough and tumble of working life. Such attitudes simply ignored the effect of this behaviour on women and the flow-on effect that such attitudes had on their employment and their opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recently amended the Sex Discrimination Act to narrow the exemptions relating to superannuation. The changes will have particular impact for workers who are part time, many of whom are women. The legislation is part of the Government's initiatives to ensure better income security retirement for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another indicator of this Government's commitment to equality of opportunity is the recent announcement that the Affirmative Action Agency is to be made an independent statutory authority. This initiative will further enhance the work of this agency in promoting the advancement of women. The Sex Discrimination Act is not without its problems and the Government is presently considering recommendations for reform of it, as suggested by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs known as the Lavarch report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Labor Government's central reform in this area was probably the enactment of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. That Act established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a fully independent statutory authority with considerable power to investigate complaints of breaches of several international human rights instruments. The Commission has established itself as the foremost Australian body in the area of protecting the human rights of all disadvantaged people in this country. The Government does not always agree with the Commission but recognises the very significant work that it undertakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most recent example of the work of the Commission that has raised public awareness of the problems of certain people with disabilities has been the inquiry into the treatment of mentally ill people. Some of the evidence that has been presented during that inquiry has shown the critical need for independent bodies such as the Commission. Without that inquiry, many of the practices that were exposed would probably never have come to public attention. Many of those examples came from States which already had anti-discrimination and other legislation designed to protect the rights of such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the Government considerably expanded the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to discrimination in employment by allowing the Commission to inquire into discrimination in this area on the grounds of age, medical record, criminal record, impairment, marital status, mental, intellectual psychiatric or physical disability, sexual preference and trade union activity, pursuant to ILO convention No. 111 on discrimination in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the Federal Government enacted the Privacy Act. That Act established the office of Privacy Commissioner and set out to ensure the rights of ordinary citizens to the protection of their privacy in certain areas of Commonwealth responsibility. Legislation to protect these rights was based on Australia's international obligations under the terms of article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.</PARA>
<PARA>Any doubt as to the need for such legislation has been firmly put to rest by the recent damning report of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption on the misuse of information by public and private officials. Governments may yet see a need to further strengthen such laws. There have been many other human rights initiatives undertaken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Labour Organisation convention No. 156 concerns equal opportunity and treatment for men and women with family responsibilities. This convention potentially affects the vast majority of the working population of Australia. Many workers are discriminated against because they have obligations to their families which may conflict with expectations by employers in relation to particular work. Yet this country prides itself on the fact that the family is the foundation of our society. Legislation is likely to be introduced into the current session to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to make it unlawful to dismiss a person on the basis of family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most difficult areas that the Commonwealth is currently addressing is that of discrimination on the basis of age. There will be a discussion paper released shortly to canvass public opinion on options for possible legislation in this area. The Government has recently announced that it has decided to draft legislation to make unlawful racial vilification. This decision is based on a number of reports to government which have recommended that such an initiative be taken. Those reports, including that of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, have indicated that for some Australians serious vilification is something they are forced to endure as part of their everyday lives. There has been a lot of hysterical reaction to this announcement, but the Government has made it clear that it is not in the business of making unlawful the odd racially based joke on such things. We are concerned about serious racial vilification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Irish ancestry allows me to say, in response to that, no. There are still further initiatives which I could mention, but time does not permit me. I point out, however, that many of the Federal Government's initiatives have been undertaken to supplement what has been undertaken in many of Australia's States and Territories. I am particularly pleased that, in the South Australian Government in the 1970s, I was able to play a role in introducing a number of pieces of legislation which, at that stage, were leading the nation in outlawing this undesirable and unwanted conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill is now to be added to this Government's outstanding record in the area of human rights. I emphasise that anti-discrimination legislation in this country is based primarily on the process of conciliation. In excess of 90 per cent of complaints are dealt with at this stage with an amicable solution being worked out with the parties concerned. This Bill is based on just such a mechanism. People with disabilities have indicated their strong views as to the need for such legislation and the Government has listened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have not dealt in any detail with the legislation that is before the House tonight, I thought it was important to set out this Government's record in relation to human rights for the Parliament and the people of Australia. I think it is not well enough understood. It is certainly unsurpassed. No government in the history of this nation has ever attempted to provide human rights for the people of this country such as those which have been provided by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can say with some justification that this Government and its Labor predecessors in the 1980s will be remembered as governments which paved the way for the rights of Australian citizens to be recognised in law for those international covenants. In some respects, some earlier governments had bound Australia to those covenants in a somewhat cavalier fashion to be introduced into the law of the nation, to be implemented with effect so that Australian citizens could benefit from these international agreements between countries which are designed to improve and increase human rights throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people with disabilities will benefit significantly from this legislation. For too long they have been without a mechanism at the Federal level to deal with discrimination against them. Many people with disabilities are amongst those most marginalised in this country. The Bill will go some way towards redressing the inequalities which people with disabilities have to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by congratulating all those people who have worked long and hard in preparing this legislation: the people who have prepared reports along the way and the people who have contributed to the legislation, particularly disabled people who have been involved in the preparation of the legislation. To all those people I say thank you for the enormous amount of work that has been undertaken. I think this is a very good Bill and, undoubtedly, it will lead to a much better quality of life for many thousands of people in our nation. That is what the task and objective of this Parliament should be. Because of that, I commend the Bill to the House with great enthusiasm. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention the comments of the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling). If I recall her words earlier in the day, she talked about the work which was undertaken in order to build towards this legislation. All the work was undertaken to make sure that we built legislation that was sensible and reasonable at the end of the day. Honourable members should bear in mind that we are not banning discrimination; we are banning unfair discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people can grasp that concept, I think all their worries about this matter will fade away. We should address the Opposition's amendment in some detail, which I will do, but the Government does not support the Opposition's call to send the Disability Discrimination Bill to a joint select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has raised questions about the assessment of outcomes. The Government has made a thorough assessment of the outcomes of the Bill for people with disabilities. It has undertaken a large number of reports and consultations on the issue. These include the Ronalds report, Human Rights Commission consultations, the Shelley report, the disability discrimination legislation secretariat discussion papers and national consultations, and a dissemination of the Bill and explanatory memorandum in print, audio and braille formats. These consultations have given us an excellent understanding of the likely outcomes of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State and Territory disability anti-discrimination legislation has been in operation for over 10 years. We have consistently and carefully been monitoring the operation of this legislation. We are well aware of how legislation of this type impacts on people with disabilities. What we are attempting to do here is to build on the existing State and Territory initiatives and to create a uniform national standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also raised the question of exemptions. It is true that all anti-discrimination legislation contains some exemptions. There is always a need to balance competing interests in this area. For instance, the special measures exemption in this Bill is designed to allow programs and initiatives targeted at people with a disability to continue their current focus and assist people with a disability to overcome the effects of past discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption in relation to telecommunications is only for a period of three years. The Government is separately looking at the key issue of providing access to people with a hearing impairment through its Budget announcement of a pilot telephone-typewriter relay system. The project will be run by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in conjunction with its language translation facilities. The pilot project will initially operate in Sydney and Melbourne. We have committed $300,000 to that project in its first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the exemption for the Defence Force, the Government recognises the need for a fit and able Defence Force, but we believe that the skills of people with a disability can be utilised to great effect in appropriate areas of the forces. There is no need for any broadening of the exemptions. The operational concerns of the defence forces are adequately met in the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions have been raised about health policy. The exemptions relating to infectious diseases and public health represent a reasonable balance between the rights of all health professionals and people with disabilities. The Bill will make only unreasonable or unfair discrimination unlawful, not discrimination based on reasonable and valid medical practice and scientific information. The provisions of the Bill with regard to unjustifiable hardship cover all legitimate concerns in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `disability' concerned a number of speakers from the Opposition. `Disability' has been broadly defined to ensure that people with legitimate grievances do not fail to have their complaints addressed because of an unduly narrow legislative definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must always be remembered that people can only make a complaint under the legislation when they have been discriminated against on the basis of disability. If they have been unreasonably discriminated against, we should ask: why should they not have a remedy? It seems to me that the more restrictive a definition you have, the more people you knock out, and the more debate you will have before the Commissioner about the definition, rather than getting on with the merits of the nature of the unfairness of the discrimination itself, and that is what we are concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more restricted United Nations definition of `disability' has been recognised as being outdated. This was discussed at the recently held second meeting of the United Nations working party for the development of standard rules for the equalisation of opportunities for people with disabilities, which was held in Vienna in May this year. The definition in the Bill is similar to that contained within existing State or Territory anti-discrimination legislation, but overcomes some recognised difficulties that have arisen from the operation of that legislation over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition does cover cognitive and neurological disorders, which was raised by the Opposition in its amendments. Clause 4(g) of the Bill defines `disability' as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A disorder, illness or disease that affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this definition adequately covers all concerned. The second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum in the Senate will include references to cognitive and neurological disorders. I think that will put the matter beyond all doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the question raised about unjustifiable hardship, it is untrue to say that there is no measure by which to judge unjustifiable hardship. This concept has been well recognised and has a long history in State legislation. There is no need for us here to further clarify provisions relating to unjustifiable hardship. The existing provisions offer the flexibility necessary to deal with the range of individual cases that may come before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I think they provide an appropriate mechanism to balance the competing rights of all the parties, including those of business and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject the need to further clarify the action plan provisions. They are designed to allow service providers and education authorities the opportunity to formulate strategies which allow organisations to deal with issues impacting on people with disabilities in a logical and coordinated manner. It is recognised that the lodgment of action plans is entirely voluntary, but it will work as a positive incentive which will bring about gradual changes in the long term. The provisions allow service providers to work on their own solutions to particular problems without the need for a major supervisory agency to oversee the plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, on the question of the relationship with the existing antidiscrimination legislation, the procedures in this legislation are based upon those set out in existing antidiscrimination legislation, both State and Federal. We see no reason to make changes to a system that has stood the test of time. We need to remind the House&mdash;and I do not want to undersell it&mdash;that we are not breaking new ground; we are making sure that a system that we are well used to will apply to those with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the questions raised about possible costs, there has been concern expressed by others about the possible costs that might be incurred because of the implementation legislation. But our experience, and State governments' experience, suggests that such fears are without foundation and that the costs to employers are minor. In fact, the cost to employers to make accommodations to employ a person or persons with a disability is most often less than $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience, particularly in those Australian States which have had this sort of legislation for some time, indicates that the possible costs are often wildly exaggerated before the legislation has come into force. In fact, when a balancing exercise is undertaken between the small costs involved and the benefits to all&mdash;especially to those with disabilities&mdash;the overall costs are, in our view, insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the practicalities of implementing this legislation, the Bill needs to be taken in the broad context of our overall initiatives in relation to people with disabilities. The Bill of itself, of course, will not and cannot overcome all existing discrimination&mdash;this is somewhat of a straw man that was raised by a number of Opposition speakers&mdash;but it does form a significant part of our approach to the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some practical measures to assist people who wish to raise a complaint under the legislation. The Bill requires the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist people in making their complaints. The Government has provided some $750,000 to community legal centres to assist people with disabilities to exercise their rights under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth believes that this legislation has been the subject of extensive consultation and is based upon existing State and Federal legislation. It is not a radical departure from existing measures already in place, and we believe it is a significant social justice initiative which will stand the test of time. People with disabilities have been without Commonwealth legislative recourse to address discrimination which they experience for far too long. There is no reason to refer this major piece of legislative reform to a joint select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a question raised by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). He gave an example of a Tasmanian footballer who is HIV positive. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is currently involved in a working party established by the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Sports Medicine Federation, which includes Basketball Australia and the Confederation of Australian Sport, to develop guidelines for sports administrators regarding HIV positive players who wish to participate in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any discrimination in this area has to be reasonable. The Australian Sports Medicine Federation already has an infectious diseases policy which makes particular reference to HIV AIDS and hepatitis B. It is recognised that there are a range of procedures which should be undertaken to minimise the risk of infection. The working party will develop detailed guidelines for sporting administrations which will further minimise these risks. If sporting administrators take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of infection in accordance with these guidelines, they will not be seen as acting in a discriminatory manner under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A decision to simply ban HIV positive people from participation in sports without reference to the already established procedures to minimise risks would be likely to be inappropriate and unreasonable. To illustrate the point, Dr Sheridan, an epidemiologist with the Queensland Department of Health, stated in the March 1992 issue of the Australian Sports Medicine Federation's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sports Medicine News</EMPHASIS> that the risk of HIV infection in contact sport could be expected to be one in 4,000,000. This should be viewed against the risk of infection of hepatitis B of one in 20,000. No sport is devoid of risk and all the Bill will ensure is that any measures to reduce such risks on the basis of disability be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Opposition made reference to the fact that we have made amendments to the Bill. It suggests that these amendments indicate that we are ill-prepared and introduced the Bill without giving it careful consideration. Of course, the opposite is the truth. We clearly indicated when we introduced the Bill into the House on 26 May of this year that we were going to disseminate it widely and seek comment from interested individuals and organisations. We distributed over 1,000 copies of this Bill and the explanatory memorandum to people with disabilities and to other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned previously, we also made copies of the Bill available in braille and on audio tape. I understand that this is the very first time that a Bill has been translated into these formats. That shows our commitment to facilitating the maximum amount of consultation and input on this question. I thank those members of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services who have undertaken that work and those who have undertaken work on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that process, the Government has received a number of representations and submissions on the Bill. We have made a number of amendments to take account of the issues that were raised with us. The amendments are not a sign that the Bill was not carefully considered; I would have thought that they are a measure of our commitment to community consultation.

<PARA>The Government introduced this Bill on 26 May 1992 and agreed that it would not proceed further with it until interested parties had had an opportunity to comment on the details of the legislation. This follows a very extensive process of consultation already undertaken on behalf of the Government by the Disability Anti-Discrimination Legislation Committee, established to advise the Government on the need for, and possible scope of, the legislation. In response to those comments, the Government has decided to make some amendments to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of definitions, the first change has been the insertion of a definition of `associate' and the use of that term to now encompass all those who would have been covered by the definition of `relatives and associates' in the existing Bill. Some concerns had been expressed in relation to the definition of `de facto spouse' in the existing Bill as part of the definition of `relative'. That definition was intended to cover genuine domestic relationships between persons, whether of the same sex or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed that by using this definition of de facto spouse unintended consequences could have flowed into other areas of personal relationships covered by Commonwealth legislation, such as marriage. Whilst the Government does not agree that that would or could have been the result, it is prepared to make these changes to prevent an issue which is not central to the legislation from clouding the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of the amendments proposed&mdash;some 30 in all&mdash;relate to this change. The Government wishes to make it clear that everyone who would have been covered by the existing definitions has now been covered by the new provisions on associates. `Relative' has now been defined without reference to spouses who are covered separately under `associates' and there will no longer be a definition of de facto spouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the definitions section, the Government has also agreed to add the term `superannuation' to the definition of services. On the matter of clubs, it has also been pointed out to the Government that there are a number of clubs and associations which are set up either exclusively for people with disabilities or where certain categories of membership have been reserved for people with disabilities. These clubs are designed to give people with disabilities a chance to share recreational and other pursuits in an atmosphere free from discrimination. It is the intention of the Government that the operation of these clubs and associations not be interfered with. Therefore, a provision is to be inserted into the existing clause 20 of the Bill to make the Government's intention clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of persons to be given directions to attend a conference, this provision has been inserted to make it clear that the Commissioner is to have a discretion as to whether to require a person to attend a conference where that person may be able to provide relevant information. On the question of inquiries into complaints, clause 79 of the Bill requires that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission discontinue dealing with a complaint where the aggrieved person notifies the Commission that he does not wish the complaint to proceed. It has been pointed out that before the Commission does discontinue dealing with a complaint it ought to satisfy itself that a decision to notify was a fully informed decision and that there was no duress placed on the person to give the notice. The additional provisions proposed give effect to that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of representative complaints, the current wording of clause 90 precludes a person bringing a complaint on behalf of a group of persons where that person is not a member of that group. This is inconsistent with the provisions relating to individual complaints which allow for complaints to be brought on behalf of others. The deletion of subparagraphs 2(a)(i) and (ii) will allow complaints to be brought on behalf of persons within a particular group who may be suffering from an unlawful act by someone who was not a member of that group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of regulations, under the existing Bill the Governor-General is required to take account of comments made by State and Territory Ministers to the Minister responsible for this Bill before making regulations to be known as `disability standards'. This provision is designed to ensure that consultation with State and Territory Ministers takes place prior to the making of such regulations. It has been pointed out to the Government that a decision to prescribe laws which may continue to discriminate after the time limit of three years under clause 47 will have considerable impact on State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government would have consulted, it is appropriate that provisions be set out in this Bill to require such consultation. In addition to these changes, a number of minor technical problems have been pointed out in the consultation process and the Government has agreed to address many of these. Full details of these amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to honourable members. I table a copy now. I commend these amendments to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude my remarks on the amendments, I would like to look briefly at some areas where amendments were suggested and where the Government has not agreed to accept those suggestions. Concerns were expressed about a number of provisions in the Bill but the most consistent concerns related to the processes for development of disability standards and to the specific exemptions that have been provided in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the development of disability standards, I wish to amplify the remarks made by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) when he delivered the second reading speech on the Bill. The Government recognises that the formulation of disability standards should be enacted and it will require major and ongoing consultations with all parties who may be affected. In particular, the Government commits itself to extensive consultation with State and Territory governments and with people with disabilities. The Government undertakes to consult widely prior to the drafting of such standards and to the wide dissemination of such standards for comment prior to their being enacted by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that these standards will have the potential to impact extensively on State and Territory governments. This Government is fully prepared to give an unequivocal commitment to ongoing and extensive consultations with those governments prior to any such standards becoming law. The introduction of such standards is a unique initiative which is designed to help in overcoming systemic discrimination. Given their uniqueness and potential impact, the development of such standards requires careful and lengthy consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government regrets the need for such exemptions as provided for in this Bill. But the making of legislation of this sort requires balances to be struck and some of those balances are easier to strike than others. The three-year exemption provided for telecommunication carriers is designed to allow the present major reforms that this industry is undergoing to be set in place prior to this legislation having an impact. Legislation of this sort could have quite a significant impact in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point to the Government's Budget announcement that a pilot project on a telephone typewriter network is to be developed. The issue of access to those facilities is being dealt with by the Government separately to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption in relation to migration has been inserted primarily because the Government does not wish to provide a further avenue for review of decisions made in this area where review already exists. The Government is prepared, however, to provide a commitment to reviewing the operation of these exemptions after the legislation has been in operation for two years. The legislation needs to be given a chance to work. This legislation also is only one of this Government's initiatives in relation to providing social justice for people with disabilities. It must be seen as but part of an overall program. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill implements the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf, both of which were done at Rome in March 1988. The convention and the protocol were drafted at an international conference convened by the International Maritime Organisation to discuss international measures that needed to be taken to protect ships and fixed platforms from acts of terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference took place against the background of the hijacking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS> in the Mediterranean Sea, during which an American tourist, Leon Klinghoffer, was murdered. That incident exposed deficiencies in international law which were fatal to attempts to bring most of the terrorists to justice. I will not now rehearse the facts in that incident. They are dealt with in some detail in various accounts. Suffice it to say that at the trial that subsequently took place in Italy only five of the 15 accused appeared before the court and the three life sentences that were imposed were imposed in absentia on terrorists who were still at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unsatisfactory outcome was due, at least in part, to uncertainties about the legal position of each of the parties involved. The ship sailed under the Italian flag, the first port of call after the hijack was in Egypt and the principal victim was a citizen of the USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to consider what would have been the position if the convention had been in operation when the incident occurred. Italy, as the flag state, and Egypt, as the state in whose territory the offenders were `found', would each have had jurisdiction and would have been obliged to consider whether to initiate prosecutions themselves or to grant extradition to another state. The USA, as the state of the victim's nationality, would also have been able to establish jurisdiction under the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be clear obligations imposed on the relevant states to take action so as to ensure the alleged offenders did not escape prosecution. A legal regime of this kind would clearly have been preferable to the situation which obtained at the time and would constitute a greater deterrent to any future terrorist act of this nature. Apart from this specific instance, the convention and the protocol deal comprehensively with acts which endanger safe navigation or operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offences created by the Bill include seizing control of a ship or fixed platform, committing an act of violence against a person on board a ship or fixed platform, destroying or causing damage to a ship, its cargo or a fixed platform, placing a destructive device on a ship or fixed platform, destroying navigational facilities, giving false information likely to endanger a ship or fixed platform, causing death or injury to a person in connection with the commission of any other offence and threatening to commit certain of these offences on a ship or fixed platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will apply to terrorist acts of the kind perpetrated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS> incident. It will have no application to other acts such as might be committed during an intense industrial dispute. The Bill will apply to an offence committed on an international voyage or on a fixed platform located on the continental shelf of a Protocol state, but outside its territorial sea. It will also apply to domestic offences where the alleged offender is found in a Convention or Protocol state other than the one where the offence was committed and to offences committed overseas where the offender is found in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this Bill will enable Australia to become a party to the Convention and to the Protocol and thereby contribute to an improvement in the general international legal environment relating to counter-terrorism. The Bill complements our legislation dealing with the safety of air navigation, which is now consolidated in the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two Bills we are debating tonight, the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill and the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill, change the basis of research levies on grain legumes and oilseeds from a specific rate per tonne to a farm gate ad valorem rate. The Grains Council, on behalf of grain growers, has recommended that this is a more equitable form of contribution because it is proportional to the net return and takes into account, obviously, the varying prices of or returns for different types of grain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us two separate Bills, but since 1990-91 there has actually been one corporation to cover the whole grains, oilseeds and legumes area&mdash;the Grains Research and Development Corporation. I commend the Grains Council for its work in consolidating this research, Don Blesing, who is the Chairman of the Corporation, and its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the first report of the Grains Research and Development Corporation, there has been some comment about the level of reserves of $30m. It has been questioned whether there is a need or whether it is appropriate to have such a level of reserves when, after all, it is growers' money that is being levied&mdash;and levied in difficult times&mdash;and when it is not actually being utilised. The answer has been that this is the first year of the combined Corporation and, therefore, there is a need to sort things out. Secondly, there is considerable variability in income from year to year and therefore there is a need for reserves to provide stability. The example was given that in the year in question it was projected that the levies would raise $14.5m but, because of the climatic situation, the actual amount raised was only $8.5m. Adequate reserves will mean more stability in the research programs, and we are looking at about 1,000 different research programs under this Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there are no Government matching dollar for dollar payments for administration under the rural research arrangements. The payments of the dollar for dollar do not happen until after the money is actually expended by the Corporation&mdash;that is, the growers' money is spent first. Once again, there is a need to have some sort of reserve. However, once again I query whether it is really in the best interests of growers to have that level of reserve for any length of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in the industry&mdash;and certainly no-one in the Opposition&mdash;queries the value of rural research.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, more than ever, it is essential, and the grain industry is a good example. There is the need to target particular markets with varieties that are suited to, or have special requirements or abilities to meet, those markets' requirements. The days of just using breeding to increase production are gone and, therefore, there is this need for particular types of research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just had a public debate on the level of rural research. It was indicated that the Government was going to change the longstanding dollar for dollar rural research arrangements up to the level of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production for that particular industry, to a 60:40 arrangement, that is, 60 per cent growers and 40 per cent Government. That would have had quite a disastrous impact on the whole rural research arrangements. It would have damaged the stability that was there, which would have created uncertainty for those in the research community. It would have been most unfair in relation to that sector of agriculture and, for that matter, all sectors of agriculture, which are going through the lowest income year ever. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the value of research, I want to refer to a recent document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural Research: The Pay-off</EMPHASIS>. It contains returns from research undertaken by the CSIRO Institute of Plant Production and Processing. It is a co-operative study by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. It was released in May 1992. There were 10 case studies of the return on the research dollar in the plant production area. </PARA>

To the year 2000 the benefit-cost ratio is 92.2:1, with an internal rate of return of 179 per cent and a value of benefit to the industry of $813m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased also to join in supporting the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill and the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill, which change the system for collecting levies for research into a wide range of oilseed and leguminous crops. The levy will in future be collected on an ad valorem basis, rather than a specific rate per tonne. Initially, that rate will be set at one per cent of the farm gate value, but there is potential within the legislation for that rate to be raised to 3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right at the outset, I should acknowledge a pecuniary interest in this particular matter, because I suspect that as an oilseed and legume producer I would pay more of these levies than anyone else in the House. Indeed, I have experienced the benefits personally in my own career as a farmer of the rural research and the various projects that have been undertaken through the research and development arrangements that are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rates that have applied for legumes in the past have varied from $1.25 a tonne for most of the leguminous crops. However, there has been a special rate of $2 a tonne for peanuts and $5 a tonne for navy beans. As one who grew more navy beans than anyone else in the country, I guess that I have been one of the largest payers of the navy bean levy. On the other hand, the oilseeds levy has been at a fixed rate of $1.55 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of moving to a percentage levy is obviously designed to ensure that each industry pays a fairer share of the costs of rural research. No-one can argue with that in principle. The establishment of a single grain research and development corporation has meant that there has been a co-mingling of the funds raised from the various rural industries and States, with basically a common pool being distributed to research projects which are assessed to be of particular value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has led to some degree of criticism that the producers of one crop are funding research in another industry. In particular, the wheat growers have had some justification for their complaint that they have been contributing at least double what they have actually received back by way of research funding. Some States have been concerned that the money raised in their State has been spent on projects in other parts of Australia. There are examples of how this disproportionate revenue raising and expenditure has</PARA>
<PARA>occurred. For instance, members of the mung bean industry have been contributing about $17,500 a year over recent years from their levies, but have had $108,000 spent in their industry in 1991-92 and $75,000 in 1992-93. So the mung bean industry has obviously done very well. Members of the peanut industry have contributed around $80,000 a year and have had about $150,000 spent in their industry. So, with the Government contribution, it could be argued that they have got reasonable value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the central Queensland sunflower growers have had just cause for complaint. They have made considerable contributions because it is one of the large volume oilseed crops, yet they have had very little research funded in their industry. The research and development corporations have taken the view that the future of the sunflower industry is somewhat clouded because of problems with markets in countries such as Portugal and Mexico and because of the threat to the sunflower industry in Australia from the importation of other oilseeds. So the researchers have been reluctant to spend money on oilseeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of oilseed research has gone towards funding new oilseed industries. In particular, there is the rape seed industry, which was developed in Victoria, South Australia and the southern Australian States. Central Queensland sunflower growers, with some justification, have felt concern that their levy moneys have been used to fund an alternative industry which has then moved around and taken away their market share. The central Queensland farmers argue that if there has been some assessment that there is no future in the sunflower industry in Australia&mdash;I might add that I contest that assumption&mdash;and that other crops have greater potential, at least the money they have put into research and development should be spent on other industries which can perhaps provide an alternative source of income for the farmers of their region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there will be no specific ownership of funds by an industry or on a State basis, I am now pleased to note that the Grains Research and Development Corporation will be required to report on where its funds are coming from and where they are spent. In other words, there will be a greater degree of transparency and therefore an assurance that farmers are satisfied that the money they contribute to research is spent in an area that is likely to be beneficial to them and not just given to benefit others and have the effect of taking away their industry share from them. The Grains Research and Development Corporation will be providing information by way of its annual report on where funds have come from and where particular allocations have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been general support within the rural industry for the changes proposed in this Bill. Everyone agrees that we need to spend more money on research. When times get tough in a rural industry and when the farmers can least afford to provide additional money, they become additionally conscious of the need to do better in the various practices associated with their industry. They want better varieties, they want to do things more efficiently and they want other aspects of their industry to be the best possible. They acknowledge the vital role of research in ensuring that we have the best possible practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industries also accept that they will have to pay if they want research done in their particular industry. There is no free money around these days. When a company or commercial operation contributes money for research, naturally it wants to achieve some benefits or commercial advantage from that research. Industries also know that, if research is done in their particular industry, they will have to pay for that research. The levies in the primary industry sector, in particular, were established on the principle that those levies would be matched dollar for dollar by the Federal Government. That has been a principle associated with each of the new primary industry levies as they have come into existence and it has enjoyed bipartisan support. That has also been a fundamental factor in attracting industries into the research and development organisation that has existed. I suspect that if it had not been for the availability of that Federal Government money, many industries would not have so willingly embraced the idea of levying themselves for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we talk about dollar for dollar funding, in practice the Government does not quite give a dollar for a dollar. There are certain limits on the amounts it will provide. Also it does not match everything that the growers supply but rather the funds that are actually spent on research. I note from the Grains Research and Development Corporation's annual report that growers contributed $12.5m in that financial year, but the Government's contributions&mdash;even though they are theoretically dollar for dollar&mdash;amounted to only $8.9m. Nonetheless, the Government's contributions are appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also benefits from rural research. It benefits from the increased productivity. It benefits because many of the research establishments would otherwise be funded by other government programs. The universities and State departments also benefit because farmer funded research helps to provide them with experts; it helps to train the people who will be the future educators, the future researchers of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it was particularly disappointing to read and to hear in the lead-up to the current Federal Budget that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) actually proposed to slash Government funding for rural research. I was amazed that anyone in the Government would break ranks on this important issue and propose, in a Budget with a $13.5 billion deficit, that a few million dollars should be saved on rural research. I thought it was a rather petty-minded approach; certainly lacking in any kind of foresight for the future. I was very pleased that someone in the Government at least had enough commonsense to hit that proposal on the head and that the Government has proceeded in the current Budget with the normal funding arrangements for rural research. So my compliments to those on the Government side who had the foresight to see the wisdom of continuing these particular arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements for collecting these levies on an ad valorem basis, some industries will pay considerably more for rural research than they pay currently. The fixed levy of $2 per tonne on peanuts, for instance, under a one per cent ad valorem levy is likely to rise to something of the order of $5 per tonne. That is a considerable additional commitment for peanut growers. Mung bean growers who currently pay only $1.25 will move to a levy of something of the order of $3 per tonne&mdash;obviously depending on the price that prevails at the time. Growers of several other leguminous crops and also oilseeds will pay additional money as a result of this legislation but, from what I can ascertain, those industries are prepared to accept those additional commitments because of their acknowledgment that rural research is so important for the future of their industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One difficulty that has not been adequately addressed in the legislation or in the Minister's second reading speech&mdash;and I hope the Minister will provide some enlightenment on this matter tonight&mdash;is the difficulty under this legislation of calculating what is the farm gate price to determine the one per cent ad valorem levy. There are various factors which will have to be taken into account. It is not just a simple matter as in the case of wheat, sorghum or some other crops where the farm gate price is readily calculated and in most instances is basically the same as the sale price. In many of these oilseed and legume crops there is a lot of processing and grading that must actually be done before the crop becomes marketable. For instance, peanuts with aflatoxin in them are absolutely worthless at the farm gate. It is only after they have been blanched, well and truly after they have left the farm gate, that they become valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone will have to determine what the real farm gate value of these sorts of commodities is. Oilseeds and legumes have differing oil contents. There are multiple grades. The futures contracts involved may affect the actual end price of the crop and alter the relativity between its actual market price and its farm gate value. There are market price movements and those become particularly significant in crops where there is pooling or blending of particular farmers' produce. Of course, some of these products are produced in relatively small batches and they are not actually weighed at the farm gate. The actual return to the farmer comes many months later after it has been through an extensive processing phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides no information on how the farm gate value is to be calculated. Even though the Grains Council of Australia supports this legislation, it has not been able to provide any technical information on the way in which these calculations will be made. As I said, it is easy for bulk commodities. It will not be so simple for these types of crops where frequently a lot of value adding is done before the farmer receives his return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out as well that the volume of production of some of these crops is quite small. Only a few hundred or a few thousand tonnes are produced, and in some cases perhaps 10 or 20 tonnes. Therefore, to calculate the various rates involved will require quite a deal of mathematical assumptions. I hope this issue can be adequately addressed in the context of the passage of this legislation through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of administering rural research and development in Australia is also a matter of some concern to the industry. We have a complex system of committees involving various State based committees as well as the central research and development corporation. We have committees to select committees and the bureaucracy associated with the administration of research in this country seems to grow year by year. The cost of selecting the Grains Research and Development Corporation was put in its annual report last year as $73,489. It cost us $73,000 just to choose the committee in the first place. Then, according to the Grains Research and Development Corporation report, Corporation members were paid $428,850 in fees and expenses during the year. The executive director is on a salary of over $110,000 per annum. Indeed, the total Corporation activity costs, according to the Budget, were $1.25m in that year. In addition to that, there were administrative costs of $1.07m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to distribute just $16.7m worth of funds for research, over $2m was spent in administration costs. We have to look very seriously at whether we are in fact spending on administration more of the growers' money, which they want to spend on actual research, than can reasonably be justified. I appreciate that there were some initial setting up costs in this first year, but unless the Grains Research and Development Corporation can get its costs under control, increasingly there will be questions asked about whether or not this is an effective way to administer our research dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions are often asked about the way in which the funds are spent. Again, turning to the annual report, it is interesting to note that the State departments of primary industries were the major beneficiaries of the farmers' financial levies. Over $9m of the research and development payments last year went to the State departments, a further $2.3m went to Commonwealth organisations, and tertiary institutions received $4.4m, leaving less than $1m to be spent by other independent institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot help but be concerned that the State departments of primary industries are winding back their efforts in research and their whole service to the primary industry sector and ask whether this is not yet another illustration of States balancing their budgets by using Commonwealth funds and farmer levies. I do want to denigrate in any way the quality of work done by State departments of primary industries, but the State departments should not be allowed to get away with reducing their own efforts by taking up the additional contributions provided by the Commonwealth and the farmers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queenslander, I note with concern the winding down of the activities of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries since the election of the Goss Labor Government. There is stacks of money for thousands of additional public servants around the place, but the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has been denuded of staff, particularly in this research and development area. The State departments have done some excellent work. They have been responsible for much of the developmental work of the oilseed and leguminous crops about which we are talking today. If it was not for their pioneering work, most of these industries would not exist in Australia. So we need to be proud of what those departments have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a navy bean grower, I think of people such as Eric Gallagher, who largely developed the upright varieties of navy beans that were responsible for the revitalisation of the industry in the 1960s and 1970s. I also think of others who have carried on that kind of research work: for example, the people who have been associated with the development of new peanut varieties over recent years&mdash;departmental staff, dedicated and talented people, who have been the catalyst for the growth and development of so many of the industries that are the subject of this legislation this evening. They have done some tremendous work with cooperating farmers. We need to acknowledge that and to express gratitude to the researchers who have put into effect the kinds of projects that farmers have actually needed and wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this research be practical, that it be farmer oriented, that it be the kind of thing that is actually likely to develop improved returns to growers in the field and not be just academic mumbo jumbo which keeps a couple of university scientists in work. Farmers will need to be sure that their research and development money is wisely spent. They are unlikely to want to continue to contribute levies unless they are sure that they are getting value for money. This particular legislation helps to ensure that all farmers will contribute equally to the research and that it will continue for their own benefits. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Honey Legislation (Repeal and Amendment) Bill 1992 terminates the Australian Honey Board from 1 January of next year and transfers certain of its functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Honey Board has operated for some 30 years, but the Government announced that it will terminate the board and transfer some of its functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation until 30 June 1995, when the Horticultural Corporation and that arrangement will be further reviewed. To a certain extent, this was a result of the Davis Review Committee on Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities, which reported that the smaller marketing authorities, including the Honey Board, faced high costs relative to the income provided by levy on producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Honey Board had been operating on a budget of $500,000, about half of which went in administration costs. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) made the point very tellingly in his comments on the previous legislation that it is very important that the administration of these organisations, corporations or whatever, is kept under control so that the value of the levies paid by producers is there for research, marketing, promotion or other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross value of production of the honey industry is about $40m, with 40 per cent going for export. I think that is a very good example of a small but very effective and efficient industry in relation to its contribution to our international trade and balance of payments. If we had more of those sorts of industries, particularly outside agriculture, which could say that they were as competitive as honey and were making their contribution to either exports or import competition to the same degree as the honey industry, we would not have this horrific balance of payments problem that we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the roles of the Honey Board was the setting of a minimum export price for bulk honey, but that was not effective because Australia had only about one per cent of the world trade, and the Board no longer appointed overseas selling agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, represented by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations and the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia, negotiated the changes with the Government. It is in agreement with the legislation and has requested that the Board be terminated at the end of this year. The Australian Honey Board Review Committee, established to consider future options, wanted the Board abolished, but recommended the continuation of domestic promotion, consumer education, quality assurance and information dissemination through the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>

One raises here again whether or not there is a cost effective situation with a small industry like that, or whether it is better placed under the umbrella of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation or, for that matter, some other organisation. That is up to the honey industry itself to determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change is expected to save the industry about $100,000 a year in administration costs. As this industry is becoming more involved in commercial pollination, the closer association with horticulture could be beneficial. The marketing component of the honey export charge is being repealed and should save growers a further $70,000 a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this adjournment to remind honourable members that six weeks ago two young Australian citizens, Iddin Gillespie, aged nine, and his sister, Shah, aged seven, were taken from their home by Raja Bahrin Shah, their biological father and prince of the Malaysian royal family, for an access period scheduled to last two nights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, which was 5 p.m. on Thursday 9 July 1992, Mrs Jacqueline Gillespie, the children's mother, now married to Ian Gillespie, a resident of Melbourne, has not seen or had contact with her children. Despite a Family Court order that the children be allowed to phone home at least once a day, there have been no phone calls. On Saturday 11 July, Mrs Gillespie informed the Federal Police that it appeared the children and their natural father had not been at their hotel, the Victoria Hotel in Melbourne, for two days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that time, the kidnapping of the Gillespie children has been marked by three distinct characteristics: firstly, the incompetence of Australian authorities in preventing the kidnapped children from leaving the country; secondly, the obvious collaboration of Indonesian authorities in the kidnapping; and, finally, the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, to take any strong line on this matter whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard something of the story of how the children were spirited from Australia in an Indonesian fishing boat through the Torres Strait into Irian Jaya and thence on to Malaysia. However, few people know the inadequacies which were to follow in alerting Coastwatch. On Monday 13 July at 11.55 p.m., Mrs Gillespie was visited by two Federal Police officers assigned to the case, Sergeant Graham Downs and Constable Fiona Pedersen of the Federal Police Family Law Squad in Melbourne. The children's stepfather, Ian Gillespie, asked the officers whether authorities such as Coastwatch had in fact been alerted. He was assured that they had been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the meeting on that night of Monday 13 July, Mrs Gillespie was also asked whether the royal family had access to yachts or light planes. She told them that they probably had and again asked the officers whether Coastwatch had been notified of the search. The officers assured her that they had notified Coastwatch and added that they had already said that to her husband. Again, on the night of Thursday 23 July 1992, Mrs Gillespie asked whether Coastwatch had been alerted and was assured by Assistant Commissioner Walter Williams of the Federal Police that it had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday 28 July, an Australian helicopter pilot, Colin Ferguson, arrived back in Australia and told the media that the children had flown from Irian Jaya to Sulawesi in Indonesia. Some days later, Coastwatch announced that it had heard distress signals from an Indonesian fishing boat which had drifted out of control for four days in the Torres Strait. Coastwatch aircraft had circled the boat after hearing distress calls mentioning that two children were aboard, but the pilots were unaware of the alert mounted by Federal Police. The Federal Police are reported in the media as admitting they had not informed Coastwatch or other similar authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fishing boat was heard to radio in English for a specific Indonesian Army colonel, the Indonesian military forces Commander-In-Chief at Irian Jaya, to rescue them. On 20 July, the Indonesian military towed the disabled motor cruiser into Merauke in Irian Jaya. On the same day, two plane loads of Australian officials were inexplicably detained at Merauke, forbidden access to their aircraft and followed everywhere they went by armed guards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans's wimpish stand in this matter is well documented. He has continued to insist publicly that it was a private matter and not a Government matter. Mrs Gillespie has not been allowed to talk to her children and the Australian Government is refusing to help. Mrs Gillespie and thousands of other Australians believe she should not have been put in the position of having to submit her fate and her children's fate to Malaysian law. To the best of Mrs Gillespie's knowledge, a minimum of 10,000 petitions, each bearing between 10 and 20 signatures, have flooded into the office of Senator Evans and other Ministers. Literally hundreds of letters have also been sent to the Gillespies from people outraged by the Government's inaction regarding the rights of the Gillespie children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I support the call by my colleague the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill, for a full Senate inquiry into this disgraceful matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Parliament sat last I named 47 occasions in south-west Queensland where contractors and graziers underpaid Australian shearers. Since that time I have been informed that in relation to those 47 cases $14,500 has been collected in underpayments to those Australian shearers. I have also been informed that since I last spoke Graeme Bruce has been convicted of 15 breaches of the award and B.J. Hammonds has been convicted of a further 10 breaches of the award.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the UGA, Bill Bonthrone, and W.J. Turner, the industrial relations officer, have said that I claimed that Hammonds was a grazier and that he had underpaid workers. Nowhere have I ever said that, either in this House or outside it. I said that he was guilty of breaking the award, which is industrial law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UGA said that purposely to try to discredit what I have said and to take pressure off the fact that there is a conspiracy in this country to break our industrial relations system by bringing in New Zealand refugees, who are leaving New Zealand to come here, and coercing them into working in the shearing industry right across this country. They are taking away Australian jobs by breaking the award and working for less than award conditions. I acknowledge in the House tonight the Australian shearers who cannot get work for that very same reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has now joined the fray in supporting the UGA and criticising the industrial awards of Queensland. It is ironic that not allowing weekend shearing in Queensland should be criticised by both the honourable member and the UGA, because over the last 12 months the United Graziers Association has had the opportunity through the Industry Commission to apply to vary the award. But it never sought to do so. The UGA did not seek to do so because it knew that some of its members and contractors were flagrantly breaking the award themselves. Therefore the Association saw no reason why it should go to the industrial arbitrator and find out that it may have to pay a little bit more in the base rate to get what it is claimed should be the rate for weekend shearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday my committee met with graziers from Victoria who also shear. They said that they are totally opposed both to weekend shearing and to breaking the award system. It is quite obvious that there is a massive difference in the pastoral industry of this country between the squatters and the battling farmers who have a different perspective on this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this is part of the conspiracy to break down the award conditions that we have in this country, as we have seen in New Zealand. Australian shearers are paying the price. As I have said in this House before, we have seen a massive campaign to support the buying of Australian wool, and I support that, but I also support the employing of Australian labour at award rates of pay and not breaking down the conditions for which we fought for 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from that, on Monday in Toowoomba the Cattlemens Union is going to meet. The Bauhinia branch, which is run by lackeys in the National Party, will be calling for me to resign from the chairmanship of my committee because I am exposing law-breakers in the pastoral industry&mdash;just like I exposed drought rorters over the last five years who ripped off $30m from the same property owners and graziers. But not a word was said at that time when their own industry lost $30m; not a word was said when local government lost $40m in transfer charges under the National Party Government in Queensland; and not a word was said when the NDRA was used as a slush fund by the National Party. It had the hide to side with law-breakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with an idiot like Bill Bonthrone, the President of the UGA, these clowns from the Bauhinia branch still think that the 1832 reform Bill was never brought in to allow people franchise and that the landed gentry run this country, as they did in England at that time. Well, they do not and we do have a democracy. Such calls from National Party organisations like the Bauhinia branch have no substance any more than do hillbillies like Bill Bonthrone, the head of the UGA, who support law-breakers like Hammonds, Blue Shearing Services and a parasite named Graeme Haycroft, who is the head of Troubleshooters, an organisation that intends to destroy the award conditions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that rural Australia does not consist of just the squattocracy; it consists of battling farmers, Australian workers and shearers, pensioners and small business people. At the present time in the pastoral areas of this country a lot of our money is going back to New Zealand; it is not being spent in Australian towns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise an issue concerning small operators in the mining industry&mdash;people who, over the past 20 years or so, outlaid an average of $6,000 to set up eductor dredging operations. The idea was that the dredges provided access for the first time to gravels along the beds of streams. In many of the areas which were intensively prospected and mined for gold in the last century, the stream beds remain untouched and offer small scale operators the best chance of finding gold in worthwhile quantities. The development of the eductor dredging system triggered renewed interest in the search for gold, as well as tin and gemstones, in many areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To explain how the system works, the operator has a small compressor on the surface, while a diver uses a pipe or flexible hose to direct a high pressure jet of water into the stream bed. The water jet loosens gravel and other material and generates a suction force which picks up the loose material and discharges it into a sluice floating on the surface. After it has been screened for gold, the material is put back in the same area of the stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But towards 1980, this mining activity came under pressure from conservation groups. Licensing was introduced in 1980 for dredging operators in Victoria. The industry has been banned in Victoria since November 1989, and I understand it is not now permitted in most other areas of Australia, with the exception of parts of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people who have operated eductor dredges are members of the Prospectors and Miners Association, which has endeavoured to represent their interests to governments and respond to the arguments of conservationists. To give honourable members an idea of the extent of this activity, the Gippsland branch of the Association in my electorate is aware of 100 people who have operated eductor dredges and indicates there may be several hundred more in that area alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining activity of this nature is a State jurisdictional matter, but the Association believes that, because there has been widespread interest in stream dredging across Australia, people generally should be more aware of the issues involved and there should be a more coordinated national approach to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, eductor dredging was examined broadly by an interdepartmental committee in 1987 and a more detailed study was conducted in 1987-88 by a working group from ministries concerned with mining, conservation, water resources and environment protection. The working group reported that no long term environmental damage could be established as a result of stream dredging. It recommended dredging continue at its existing level at that time on a small number of streams. But then, around the time of the 1988 election, the Government amended the Mines Act to provide that no more licences would be issued. There has been no eductor dredging in Victoria since late 1989 and the Victorian Minister has told miners repeatedly that he sees no reason to review the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of the Prospectors and Miners Association are, firstly, that the ban was imposed, as it seems there were bans put into effect in other States, without scientific evidence to show that dredging causes environmental damage. The Association says the experience of its members and the information they have gathered indicate that eductor dredging does not mobilise loose materials within a stream. It argues that floods, the use of boats and vehicle access to areas adjacent to streams cause more environmental problems than dredging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, all dredging activity was stopped without a proper hearing. People directly affected by the ban were simply not consulted, and the Association submits, quite forcefully and reasonably, that miners should have been entitled to a full public hearing before such a dramatic step was taken. The case of the miners has hardly been given fair consideration. This is a similar situation to that in which landowners in the timbered areas of Victoria, such as East Gippsland, found themselves under the Victorian Labor Government's punitive restrictions on the clearing of native vegetation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate legislation on land clearing incorporated significant amendments moved by the State coalition parties to provide a more workable system which takes account of conditions in the various regions of the State. But in the first instance the restrictions came into force overnight under a blanket amendment to the State's planning regulations. Landowners have been working on long term plans to clear areas of their properties for commercial production and those who bought properties on the understanding they could be cleared found their operations frozen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were numerous stories of people who faced financial ruin because their lifetime's development and management strategies had been overturned at the stroke of a pen. The timber industry in Gippsland has faced a similar battle of wits to avoid the quicksands of shifting government policy over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last people to be given an equal say in the outcome of these policy shifts are those directly concerned&mdash;the people in the resource rich areas whose families and communities depend on reasonable access to natural resources. They have no desire to see the landscape laid to waste, but rightfully expect a proper balance in the management of public land and for their interests to be given equal weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is the case with the people who, until 1989, had been involved in dredging for gold. There is some suggestion that people with dredging equipment have continued to operate in some isolated areas since the ban came into force, but I am not aware of any having been detected and charged. The majority have been forced to abandon their mining activities and let their equipment gather dust. In quite a number of cases miners and prospectors have lost their livelihoods and are on the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my information, it was possible, with equipment worth around the average amount of $6,000 and a reasonable knowledge of prospective gold-bearing areas and dredging techniques, to net gold worth tens of thousands of dollars in a season. There have been people who have earned a reasonable living, but they are unable to do so because they have been shut out of the industry without a fair hearing and without scientific evidence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy Speaker, I was intending to make the speech tonight but, looking at it, I see that I cannot possibly get it into five minutes. I will delay it until the grievance debate and get it on the air, because I think these things need to be publicised much more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, I want to support tonight the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) who spoke on the shearing situation in Australia. I think that people ought to reflect on what is happening. The consequences of this very short term policy are devastating for a lot of small farmers. In many parts of the country, the small farmers are also shearers. They supplement their incomes and in fact acquire and finance their farms through the money they get from shearing. This is now a source of income denied to them and, with the present economic situation in the rural areas, the effect is quite devastating not only on them but on the economy of Australia as a whole. I think it is appalling that some of the agro-political organisations are so short-sighted that they are jumping at what they see as an opportunity to squeeze the cost of shearing in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Peter Lee&mdash;who was at one time the President of the WAFF, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, aptly known as the `wafflers'&mdash;is very much for the New Zealand shearers. Peter Lee is interesting because he is now a candidate for the Liberal Party on the upper house ticket for the State Parliament. Peter Lee was also a trustee of the Western Australian Farmers Federation. As a trustee, he was responsible for the money that was contributed by way of bonds by farmers. It is common knowledge now that the Western Australian Farmers Federation is broke and that bond holders are not going to get their money. In the normal course of events, he as trustee would be liable for that money. This would presumably send Mr Lee broke and he would not be able to hold a place in Parliament. But have no fear, he will get over that and I am sure that he will appear on the Liberal Party ticket. It just goes to the integrity of this matter. A person whose competence is demonstrated by the results that now flow from his folly is one of the people recognising the New Zealand shearing situation and urging farmers to employ this New Zealand labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it in the best interests of farmers? I would submit it is not. I was told recently by very successful farmers in the western districts of Victoria that last year, using Australian shearers, they had their very best shearing ever. They said in terms of real costs it was the cheapest shearing and they were very happy with the results. They said that they, like everyone else, had looked at using the New Zealand labour but they found out that there were a lot of hidden costs involved. While they would shear cheaper, they were demanding to work longer. This put an intolerable strain on their own staff. They either had to pay them a lot of overtime to start earlier and work later or the staff simply jacked up or broke down through the pressure. They said that shearing was traumatic enough at any time, they wanted a smooth shearing operation and they would not enter into these sorts of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also said that because of the reduced prices a lot of the shearers were what they described as very scruffy. The shearing was not of a good quality. It is interesting to note that one does not find these fly-by-night New Zealand shearers shearing the difficult sheep in the difficult country. They go for the easy shearing in the easy country where they get the big tallies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a denigration of all New Zealand shearers, because some of the greatest criticism I have had of the present situation is from New Zealand shearers who have made a commitment to Australia. They have come to Australia, they live here, they pay their taxes to Australia and they strongly resent the people who are ripping off Australia. It must be remembered that if New Zealanders were to return to New Zealand&mdash;I have many in my electorate; those who can vote I am sure will vote for me, but most do not vote&mdash;there would be about 25 per cent unemployment in that country. The reality is that New Zealand is exporting unemployment to Australia and we sit back and accept it like mugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to do something about this.

The Wonthaggi Patchers took the time to come up here to Canberra some six months ago to check the colour of the walls so that the background of the patchwork would be applicable to my office. Today has been a good day because the patchwork has been hung in my office. I am proud to say that I have in my office craft work from people of great talent in my electorate. </PARA>

In my electorate there are 50 or so people who have combined together to create artwork from their own hands, their own talent, their own design and their own energy. Hundreds of hours went into the making of this patchwork. They charged me for it, which was acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best part was that I attended a community day in Wonthaggi where all the community services and volunteers were showing their wares&mdash;what they do for the community&mdash;to the township of Wonthaggi. There were people from Federal Government departments, State government departments, local initiative groups and local welfare groups. They asked me&mdash;a Liberal&mdash;to come and open the community day because there was a view that I actually cared about what was happening in my electorate, and I do. I also care about the fact that I now have some 13,000 people unemployed in my electorate. When I was elected I had 2,000. If honourable members do not think that causes some pain, it does. </PARA>

There is a view this evening that the Government has double counted on the figures&mdash;we will check that tomorrow morning&mdash;and included some of the funds for Isaacs, Corinella, Holt, Dunkley and even perhaps McMillan all in the same figures. If that is the case, what was going to be of great benefit to my community is now going to be a total debacle and the Minister should resign.

If he wants to put out those figures as a misrepresentation of the allocation of funds that are going into the electorates of Isaacs, Corinella, Dunkley and others, I suggest we have a very close look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to look at the variation in figures between the city of Springvale and the Pakenham Shire. On one set of figures for the Pakenham Shire that have been presented by the Minister there is an allocation of $4,524,016. It is rather interesting that that is for the shire of Pakenham on one set of figures, and on the other side, the figure for Springvale is $238,924. These are two sets of figures that have been presented. On the other side we have an allocation in reverse where the city of Springvale has those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it very interesting when we look at the city of Moorabbin. The city of Moorabbin has a number of unemployed who would actually use the CES office in the city of Oakleigh, which is where the figures come from, and we find that there is no allocation whatsoever. The city of Sandringham in my electorate has no allocation whatsoever. When we start to get to rubbery numbers, I have some major concerns as to where all these figures lead and what the Minister is trying to do with these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a genuine concern to try to provide some income for the constituents of the electorates that I represent. When these sorts of figures are presented as the means upon which constituents of mine in the various municipalities are going to receive some sort of incentive and some sort of opportunity to get jobs, I think that the representation has been somewhat of a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation of funds within my electorate is presented by the Minister as being around $6m. I will take only a part of Chelsea in my electorate. It has an allocation in excess of $1m. The percentage for the city of Chelsea will be somewhat less than half of that, so we are looking at half a million dollars. What is provided for the city of Mordialloc is $500,000. We really have about $1m which will be provided for the electorate of Isaacs and not some $6m that is provided by way of the municipalities. I think it would be fair for the Minister to explain that process. I am not arguing with the process of people getting funds to try to generate jobs in the area, but I think we need the whole process cleared up as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the comments made by my Opposition colleague the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) in respect of the table that I provided to the House today concerning the allocation of the local capital works program. The important thing that perhaps the honourable member for Isaacs has not realised&mdash;and he is a reasonably new member of this House&mdash;is that these particular grants include capital works programs for councils where there is an overlap of electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government areas do not necessarily coincide with Federal division boundaries. For example, tomorrow I will be announcing the financial assistance grants for Victoria. They have already been provided for a number of States and the Commonwealth. Honourable members on both sides of the House would be aware that where there is a council wholly within a Federal division the financial assistance grants and the local road council grants are provided for that council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to the point I made earlier, where there is an overlap within the electorate, clearly some councils are shared between neighbouring members. If one adds up all of the figures on the chart which I have indicated, one will see that there is more than the $345m that was announced by the Government. I am simply saying&mdash;and honourable members are not realising this&mdash;that there is an overlap of Federal divisional boundaries with local councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot speak for Opposition members who have not bothered to check with my office about the specific details, but certainly included within the Federal division of Isaacs is the local government area of Chelsea, which has been allocated $1,145,781 on a notional basis. Partly included within that division is the Springvale Council area with a $4,524,016 notional allocation, and wholly within the division of Isaacs is the Council of Mordialloc, with $554,443. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had presented these figures and just included the Council of the City of Mordialloc, the honourable member for Isaacs would have had very good reason to get up in this House and accuse me of not providing the full information about council boundaries within his Federal division. As I have said on a number of occasions, the financial assistance grants which are provided to honourable members take into account the fact that there are overlaps within Federal divisional boundaries with local council boundaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By directing its resources to those areas which will generate the maximum returns to Australia, CSIRO will make a substantial contribution to the government's strategy for reducing unemployment and achieving economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The recently released CSIRO Strategic Plan which covers the period 1991-92 to 1995-96 maps out the way ahead for the Organisation over the next five years, and indicates substantial benefits from research conducted during that period for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This CSIRO Strategic Plan reflects the Organisation's first attempt to establish research priorities. The process of setting priorities involved assessment of the benefits flowing from adoption of the products of research and CSIRO's capacity to deliver research outputs, in 17 research areas corresponding to the principal sectors of the Australian economy as well as major areas of community concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing the return to Australia from its research effort CSIRO accounts for two major factors:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">attractiveness</EMPHASIS>, which combines the potential economic, social and environmental benefits for Australia and Australia's ability to capture the benefits by converting technological progress into commercial or other gains; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">feasibility</EMPHASIS>, which combines technological progress that could be potentially accomplished and the nation's and CSIRO's ability to achieve that progress in a timely way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, CSIRO's resource allocation decisions over the long term give much consideration to the benefits likely to flow to Australia from the research, as well as the feasibility of the research. Present and projected economic situations in Australian and world markets are factored into the research priority decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO will continue to be a significant contributor to economic growth, through growth of new products and industries and hence the creation of new jobs. For example, assessments of the benefits flowing from recent CSIRO research include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$500 million from aluminium research;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$2 billion from research on ten projects for the rural plant industries</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$420 million from five research projects for the rural animal industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, estimates of the expected benefits from planned outcomes of CSIRO's R&amp;D in the minerals and energy area amount to $2500 million a year. This includes the establishment of a coal-bed methane industry in Australia and the spread of the SIROSMELT technology at the rate of at least two new installations a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an increasing number of Australian firms recognise that they can only become world competitive by investing in technology and skills, the benefits of CSIRO research will become more widespread. With commitment and determination to the upgrading of technology and skills, Australia will ensure a future characterised by employment growth and prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) CSIRO is committed to research in support of national economic, social and environmental objectives. As a result of its rigorous identification of research priorities and their implementation through the CSIRO Strategic Plan, the Organisation is well placed to deliver innovations to Australian Industry over the next five years. These will aid in the generation of increased production of goods and services for the domestic and international markets and the commensurate growth in employment. Among the high priority areas identified was research on the `environmental aspects of economic development'. Major new international opportunities in this area will provide considerable growth in employment. Australia is well placed to capture a significant share of this growth.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided in December 1992 to transfer from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Commission, responsibility for the community based elements of the Training for Aboriginal Program.
