<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Originally the Committee undertook this inquiry to identify the threat international ship operations pose to Australia's marine and coastal environment and how best to reduce the risks involved. However, the Committee encountered problems, on an international scale, which threaten the lives of seafarers as well as Australia's marine environment. This report is about a minority of ships: bad ships; ships that endanger the lives of those who serve in them; ships that are the source of major risk to the marine environment and marine facilities of the nations they visit; ships on which seafarers are abused and exploited by officers and management alike; ships that well deserve to be known as `ships of shame'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that the majority of shipowners and operators are responsible. However, it takes only one substandard vessel to create damage on the scale of that caused by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> or by the recent grounding of the tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aegean Sea</EMPHASIS> off the Spanish coast. Australia must be spared from such damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the inquiry, the Committee was told of the operation of unseaworthy ships; untrained, underpaid, sexually abused and exploited crews; false ship and crew certificates; careless insurance practices; and foreign governments not meeting their international maritime obligations. The Committee was astonished by the level of agreement within the shipping industry and its clients on the nature and details of ship safety problems. The existence of widespread agreement within the industry indicates there was a level of tacit condonation of current substandard operating procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mariners, their organisations and missions to seamen were almost alone in speaking out against substandard ships and their substandard practices. On many occasions, witnesses told the Committee that they felt powerless to do anything to improve ship safety standards or halt the abuse of crews. Significantly, on most occasions commercial and employment considerations prevented action by individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that ship safety problems will persist until the beneficiaries of substandard shipping practices are brought to account. These beneficiaries include governments which accept ship registration fees and pay lip service to the international maritime obligations; ship survey groups, or classification societies, who readily accept vessels already rejected by more reputable societies; classification societies that issue ship certificates which do not accord with a vessel's true condition; substandard ship owners, operators and managers; crewing and training agencies; and, lastly, charterers, importers and exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendations cover both national and international issues. To achieve a tighter focus on the beneficiaries of the system, the Committee has made several recommendations to improve the availability of ship information to ship charterers. The establishment of easily accessible national and international ship information databanks by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the International Maritime Organisation will remove the cloak of commercial confidentiality which has restricted the availability of information in the past. Additionally, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority publish monthly reports of port state control inspections of vessels which have been found to have defects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was also concerned that Australia adopt a tougher stance towards substandard ships which visit Australian ports. The Committee has accordingly recommended that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority be provided with sufficient funds to improve the level and effectiveness of port state control inspections. More frequent, consistent and stringent port state control inspections will raise the expectation of substandard ship operators that their ships will be detected and detained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee welcomes the 15-nation Asia-Pacific regional port state control inspection system proposal which is being coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It is recommended that vessels should be required to provide proof of adequate protection and indemnity insurance cover and compliance with International Labour Organisation Convention 147 on employment conditions before being permitted to enter Australian ports. The Committee has also recommended that the Australian Government strengthen representation and level of activity at the International Maritime Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of this inquiry should see the beginning of a wider appreciation of the dangers and abuses of substandard shipping and a more concerted effort by the international shipping industry to end substandard shipping practices. To assist the international shipping industry to raise the profile of ship safety problems, the Committee will initiate action to bring together interested parties, on both a national and international level, to consider the report, its recommendations and associated matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to join the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) in presenting this report. As a member of his Subcommittee, I thank him for his leadership during that inquiry. I am sure I speak on behalf of all other members of the Subcommittee when I say that. The preface of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> sets out very clearly what the report is about. For the benefit of the House, I will read the first paragraph into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is about a minority of ships, bad ships, ships that endanger the lives of those who serve on them. Ships that are the source of major risks to the marine environment and marine facilities of the nations they visit. Ships on which seafarers are abused and exploited by officers and management alike. Ships that well deserve to be known as `ships of shame'.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to remember that we are talking about a minority of ships. It does not excuse in any way at all the behaviour of some shipowners, but it would be a great shame to tar everyone with the same brush. It would undermine the credibility of this report if that were to happen, and that would be a great shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee took evidence from both ship operators and ship charterers, who made it plain that they maintain very high standards and that they see that their best interests lie in that practice. Evidence relating, for example, to oil tankers suggested that, despite the unfortunate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident&mdash;which, of course, was a catalyst for this inquiry&mdash;little threat can really be seen to be posed at this stage to our coastline environment or to the lives of crews by oil tankers as they are currently operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidently the major oil companies are largely responsible for this. We heard evidence that suggested they go to considerable lengths to try to avoid the massive cost and extremely bad public relations outcomes of oil spillage disasters, so they are careful to check the ships that they charter. Liner shipping also essentially appears to set reasonable standards. The major problem seems to be in the area of the dry bulk carriers. They are the ships that take the hardest hammering and that deteriorate most in mechanical terms as they age, as they are subjected to the massive stresses and strains of huge bulk loads. On page 28 of the report, under the heading `Economic and commercial considerations', we refer to the world economic situation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Witnesses and submissions to the inquiry suggested that the current downturn in the world economy, while not being the cause of ship safety problems, is certainly sustaining conditions which enable those problems to persist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .      . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current global economic downturn, in combination with excess tonnage and operation of substandard ships by irresponsible owners, has forced some freight rates down to a level where ship operating costs are under considerable pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to commercial pressure, substandard ship owners/managers are accepting lower freight rates, leaving responsible owners/managers who are unable to operate at the lower freight rates with a declining market share. This is particularly evident in the bulk trades. The acceptance by charterers of the low freight rates available through the operation of substandard shipping exacerbates this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>So these low financial returns, which unfortunately tend not to justify new shipbuilding, have resulted in an ageing of the world fleet. Luckily, that now looks to be stabilising and may well turn around in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee heard evidence that in some instances cost pressures do not allow for routine maintenance to be carried out properly. Where maintenance is not carried out, it may be a case of the captain and the crew not being provided with the necessary resources, rather than poor on-board procedures. Just as commercial realities have helped to create these problems, ultimately they may do much to help right them. The Committee heard evidence which suggested that the ever higher cost of insurance for older ships in particular and, indeed, eventually the possible denial of insurance at all for totally substandard ships may well prove a vital and useful force for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human element is extremely important in this. I note the commendable concern shown by the Committee in general for the people who crew these ships and who are often subject to dreadful conditions. We heard some horror stories; there is no doubt about that. I, for one, find the heartless and even blatant racism of some owners and operators quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should keep some balance. We should be careful that we do not go overboard in trying to set unrealistically high standards based on our expectations in this country. I say this because I believe there is a role for older, albeit well maintained, ships operated by smaller, more modest operators. It would give them a chance to break into the trade; it would give exporters in this country the chance to get in at a slightly lower rate than some of the bigger, more professional operators are able to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should not attempt to impose unrealistic standards of crew pay and conditions on ships and ship crews visiting from abroad. Although we might regard the levels of pay and conditions applying to Third World crews as unacceptable, to the members of those crews they may represent the chance to find gainful employment and to escape a poverty trap. That chance would be denied them if we were to insist on the sorts of standards which we regard as totally acceptable in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must do all we can to set higher standards where necessary, but we must also keep in mind the need to be realistic. Australia is a trading nation, dependent on trade for 25 per cent of its national income, compared to just 7 per cent for America. Australia is a trading nation which is in deep trouble, with plenty of poverty problems at home. We should not pretend that we can afford to push up costs by insistence on totally unrealistic practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 December 1992 says that Australia should open up its coastal trade to more competition. It urges both the Government and the coalition to take this issue more seriously. Cabotage is, in my view, a separate issue. That is the only point I want to make on the question of cabotage, ship safety was the concern of this Committee of inquiry. I commend the report and its recommendations, which in my view, if sensibly and honestly applied, will do much to right many wrongs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tabling of this report is a significant event for the Australian Parliament. It is the first comprehensive report on human rights to the Parliament and, as such, recognises the growing importance and acceptance of human rights as a central issue in both domestic and international politics. There has been a good deal of rhetoric on this subject and, as always, there could be a danger of overkill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights principles and their promotion are a measure of our civilisation. Human rights are central to the purposes of government. They provide a rule of law that is just and fair, rather than arbitrary or partisan, and one that substitutes for the raw and violent use of power institutions that will peacefully reconcile conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Subcommittee was established in May 1991 as a permanent subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Its first reference, received in May 1991, was to inquire into and report on Australia's international efforts to promote and protect human rights. In November 1991, the first annual report on human rights was received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and this became the basis of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry generated wide interest, and the Subcommittee has quickly become the focus of attention for many groups in Australia which are concerned, often because of ethnic ties, with the many human rights abuses in the world. While this was not intended to be the central work of the Subcommittee&mdash;and in many ways it is not equipped to deal with the volume of material that is provided to it&mdash;it is probably an inevitable extension of its work which recognises an earnestly felt need in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry received 89 submissions. Public hearings were held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, between December 1991 and June 1992. Central to the inquiry has been an examination of the ways in which Federal governments have incorporated human rights principles into policy and practice at an international level, such as in foreign policy, defence cooperation and overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Subcommittee looked at the international structures established by the United Nations to promote human rights. It examined Australia's relations with these organisations, and also our ratification of, and compliance with, international human rights treaties. The inquiry was told that Australia had failed in significant areas by placing reservations on a number of articles in important human rights covenants and conventions. These articles related to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees. If we are to speak with any authority on human rights, these omissions should be rectified. The Subcommittee recommends that this be done without delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most critical and controversial question that arose in the inquiry was whether there should be a linkage between aid or trade and investment and the human rights records of recipient countries. Australia has taken the view so far that this issue should be decided on a case by case basis because the circumstances are complicated and the results of such linkages hard to govern. The Committee is very aware of the international trend, since the end of the Cold War, of increasing linkages between human rights and aid. However, many of the countries which are making the link do so from a position of strength and have been able to make a substantial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee would support such linkages in principle and indeed, where international action can be achieved, Australia should support it. However, we are not a large power easily able to make an impact through the threat of or actual withdrawal of aid or the imposition of trade sanctions. Furthermore, it is not always straightforward to gain regional support for the human rights principles we wish to promote in a particular recipient country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem imperative for us to seek to build regional consensus on what constitutes good governance and to do this either informally, as at present through dialogue and representation, or more formally through a regional forum. The Committee recommends that the Government explore the possibility of establishing such a regional forum. In the meantime, the Committee supported the view of many submissions that the aid program could make a contribution to better observance of human rights through a proactive policy within the aid program. Many of the suggestions were innovative and practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first public hearing of the Human Rights Subcommittee was held on 2 December 1991 and considered the tragic situation of the massacre which had occurred in Dili on 12 November 1991. This hearing was an unusual one and was created by unusual circumstances. The intention was not to conduct a definitive inquiry into what happened in East Timor but to place factual information about the events of 12 November 1991 on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another eyewitness account was given to the Committee by Major-General Chamlong Srimaung, the leader of the pro-democracy forces in Thailand. He was arrested by the military government during the demonstrations in May 1992. He spoke to the Committee about those demonstrations and about the November 1991 shooting of civilians by the army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All other hearings were conducted in response to the very great volume of submissions received by the Committee. We were overwhelmed by the extent and range of the problems described to us. We simply did not have the resources in the secretariat, or the time, to deal with all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is very aware of the delicacy and sensitivity of the issue of human rights. We had to hold a number of hearings in camera because the evidence being given would have put people at risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said already, the tabling of this report is a significant event for the Australian Parliament. Few topics generate as much interest as human rights and there are few issues of more sensitivity, especially between nations. One always has to step very carefully and be aware that what one may see as a genuine interest and a concern about human rights in various countries others, especially in the country concerned, might see as an interference in the domestic affairs of the particular country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No country likes to have its treatment of its people examined and likes it even less when it is criticised because of that treatment. The question of interference in the internal affairs of another country is always an interesting and a complex one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, strict adherence to article 2(2) of the UN Charter is being put to the test. As racism is increasingly being seen as a crime against humanity, so also I believe are violations of human rights. Violations of human rights whenever they occur are a crime against humanity, and violations of human rights must be condemned wherever they occur. We cannot be selective in our condemnation of violations of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A country must be judged in the international community by how it treats its minorities and its dissidents. I hope that this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS> is only the first of a yearly report within the system. The emphasis of the Subcommittee is on the record of the Australian Government and its activities to promote and to protect human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to take it on itself to comment on the human rights records of others, it does its cause no good by not having its own house in order. Perhaps there should be a closer examination of Australia's ratification of, and compliance with, international human rights treaties. The inquiry was told in no uncertain terms that Australia had failed in significant areas by placing reservations on a number of articles in important human rights conventions and covenants. The articles relate to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to ratify these articles has detracted from our position on human rights. It reflects weakness in our record and may inhibit the full exercise of rights within Australia. If we are to speak with any authority on human rights, these omissions should be rectified. The Committee recommends that this be done without delay. Successive Australian governments have failed to ratify fully the human rights treaties to which we are party, often because of an extraordinarily slow process&mdash;in some cases, taking 20 years&mdash;of consultation within the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time this Federal Government exercised its power. We need to restore or enhance our international credibility and speak with a single national voice on these human rights issues. The States are holding us back and damaging Australia's credibility on human rights. It is time this Parliament exercised leadership on this issue and, where necessary, exercised its power to override the States. It would perhaps be more realistic if the many people in Australia who are constantly demanding action by Australia in various parts of the world put some of their energy into making sure that Australia ratified all conventions on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a very hard-working committee. I commend the Chairman, Senator Schacht, and the other Committee members on both sides of the House, and the staff: Denise Picker, Margaret Brown, and especially the secretary, Margaret Swieringa. We had a huge number of submissions and, as word of our work spread, so did the volume of submissions we received increase. Often it was almost overwhelming when we saw the number of submissions that were coming in. It does seem that the abuse of human rights in the world is a growth area, and it is a very sad reflection that we have made so much progress in so many parts of the world, but that the one area where we have not made progress is in the protection of those basic democratic human rights that we all so fervently aspire to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stockholding and sustainability in the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS>, together with the evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry into Australian Defence Force stockholding policies had its genesis in concerns expressed by the Chief of the Defence Force four years ago. The Committee shared the concerns of the Chief of the Defence Force on matters that are fundamental to Australia's capability to defend itself. The Chief of the Defence Force referred to problem areas with readiness, particularly with respect to the capacity of our logistic system to support the operational elements at higher levels of readiness. He also referred to the question of stockholdings. The Committee therefore welcomed the timely reference to inquire into stockholding policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the inquiry progressed, it became evident to the Committee that the Australian Defence Force does not have a stockholding policy. The Committee had access to an abundance of evidence that showed that over a 30-year period Defence has been unable to develop a stockholding policy that adequately addressed defence capabilities, activity levels, usage rates of war materiel and sustainability. Notwithstanding the inability of Defence to determine activity levels and usage rates, the Committee believes that stockholding and sustainability policies should be put in place without further delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of accurate activity level and usage rates for broadly defined contingencies should not prevent judgments being applied to these policies. The data can be refined and the policies amended as more accurate information becomes available. The Committee believes that the Chief of the Defence Force, as the arbiter on judgments relating to military preparedness, should resolve any disputes on stockholding policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence planning and activity is concentrated on preparing for low level and escalated low level contingencies. The Committee noted that there is disagreement within Defence on precisely what low level contingencies need to be prepared for. Defence's preoccupation with preparations relating only to ill defined low level threats precludes any consideration of preparations for higher levels of threat. Indeed, the emergence of a higher level threat than that planned for would find the Australian Defence Force without the necessary capabilities or state of preparedness. The Committee strongly believes that Australian Defence Force preparedness must provide for the equipment and reserve stocks needed to meet the highest level of credible threat. Moreover, advantage should be taken of the present low level threat situation to prepare to meet higher levels of threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence presented to the inquiry on outfitting forces for United Nations commitments raised doubts about the adequacy of existing Australian Defence Force capabilities. It was clear to the Committee that the relatively small and short term United Nations commitments of recent years have impacted adversely on Australian Defence Force preparedness. The Committee believes that it is likely that Australia will be asked to increase the level of forces committed to United Nations activities&mdash;indeed, this belief has been borne out only this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australian defence forces are to be increasingly involved in United Nations commitments, planning based on the levels of credible threat&mdash;along with resource constraints&mdash;will create a national security risk factor which the Committee believes is unacceptable. The Committee therefore recommends that separate provision be made for a range of United Nations commitments which would be acceptable to and agreed by the Government and that funding be provided as an extension of the Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of concern to the Committee relates to the procurement of significant items, such as missiles, from overseas suppliers. The Committee believes that the Australian Defence Force should not rely upon the ready availability of such items, either at short notice or even within a warning time for higher level threat. The Committee therefore recommends that, in regard to long lead time items, Defence examine alternative supply arrangements, such as new sources of supply, indigenous production and the maintenance of strategic reserves. The Committee believes that the implementation of this recommendation would also minimise the risks associated with placing too much reliance on government-to-government agreements which provide no guarantees of availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is concerned that the ADF priorities should be in competition with those of other users and, in a worse case situation, the provision of items may not be agreed by the supplier nation. I record my appreciation to my fellow subcommittee members and the Committee secretariat staff&mdash;Gillian Gould, Marina Ellis, Elizabeth Robertson and Margaret Brown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take pleasure in joining the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in commenting on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stockholding and sustainability in the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS>. In so doing, I would like to read from the foreword by the honourable member for Herbert, because I think it encapsulates what we were talking about and what we were investigating in this inquiry. The foreword reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stockholding matters cannot of course be considered in isolation. They have to be related to preparedness, which in turn has to be linked to the capabilities that, in accordance with strategic guidance, must be possessed by the Australian Defence Force. This inquiry therefore goes to the heart of Australia's capability to mount effective operations, not only within our direct area of strategic interest but also as part of our alliance responsibilities. It is particularly timely as Australia faces a more uncertain strategic environment following the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and the consequent effects in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that encapsulates the importance of this report. As a member of the Committee, at many times I found the material presented and the way in which it was presented baffling. One of the difficulties we encountered&mdash;and this is something which really needs to be addressed&mdash;was the reluctance on the part of some Defence personnel to be as open and as straightforward with the Committee as would make the Committee's task and its report so much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a reluctance on the part of some Defence personnel to tie in to the work of the Parliament's committees. The Parliament's committees are not going to go away. In my view, they are one of the most valuable aspects of membership of this Parliament. All members of the bureaucracy, whether they be in the defence forces or within the Commonwealth bureaucracy generally, need to appreciate that their appearances before committees of the Parliament are very important and that the evidence they give should be clear, straightforward and unequivocal. Unfortunately, there were some occasions when there was great difficulty in eliciting the sort of information we needed to get. Another section of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is disagreement within Defence on what low level contingencies need to be prepared for. In a situation where specific threats are not evident, ADF preparations including capability criteria should provide for reserve stock and equipment needs to meet the most extreme credible threat scenario. The Committee endorses the concern expressed by CDF about the capacity of our logistics system to support the operational elements which are required at the higher states of readiness. The equipment problems evidenced in outfitting small forces for UN commitments add to that concern.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Herbert has already referred to that. Another paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of knowledge on what low level contingency may arise, preparedness needs to address the higher end of the threat spectrum. The indications are that present ADF policies and resource levels will result in a core force of designated units equipped and maintained at the expense of lower readiness state units. United Nations commitments are making heavy demands on ADF resources, are highlighting deficiencies in current planning and resource levels and are impacting on ADF capacity to meet even low level contingencies.</PARA>
<PARA>I and the other members of the Committee were very concerned about the absence of a coherent policy in this area. The evidence presented indicated that a whole lot more work needs to be done. I believe that the recommendations of the report will be very useful, both to the Government and the defence forces, in achieving those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter I would like to draw to the attention of the House. Through evidence presented to the Committee on the United Nations commitments, the Committee's attention was drawn to the situation of Australian troops participating in United Nations operations in the western Sahara. The Australian contingent was dispatched to join the UN operation in September 1991, whereupon the weapons and the radios of the communicators were impounded by Moroccan authorities. In the view of the Committee, it is intolerable that the Government should allow members of the ADF to remain as part of the UN force without weapons for their personal protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that, if there is an element of risk, the soldiers should be armed; if there is no element of risk, it would be more appropriate to send civilian technicians. Indeed, the Committee strongly believes that no unit of the Australian Defence Force should be committed to a United Nations operation without firm guarantees that equipment will remain with the unit. In the event of a situation such as that in Morocco occurring, the Australian contingent should be withdrawn. The Committee was extremely concerned about this particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Committee and the staff&mdash;Gillian Gould, Marina Ellis, and all the others&mdash;who did such a tremendous job in assisting the Committee's work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This, the Committee's third report on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs, marks the end of an extensive examination of the way pharmaceutical products are made available to Australian consumers. It completes a detailed review of the roles and responsibilities of all major professionals who play a role in ensuring the quality use of medicines. The Committee, in the course of its investigations, has collected over 1,700 pages of evidence at public hearings and 2,500 pages of written submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, in its three reports, has made 89 recommendations and has comprehensively dealt with all factors involved in the distribution and consumption of medicines at a national level. This is the first inquiry conducted by the Federal Parliament which has looked at the pharmaceutical environment in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the commencement of this inquiry there have been many developments influencing the prescription and supply of drugs in Australia. The conduct of the first part of the inquiry coincided with a major overhaul of the drug evaluation system and intense scrutiny of the regulatory framework governing access to drugs through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's first report complemented and extended other inquiries which were specifically looking at the role of the pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic goods administration. The second report, tabled in October this year, dealt with prescribing. It was brought down at a time when changes to the structure of general practice were being announced by the Government. The report attempted to take account of these changes and developments and to integrate these initiatives into a structure for improving the quality use of drugs. It focused strongly on the notion of the health team and stressed that doctors have a pivotal role in guiding the work of this health team and ensuring that medicinal products are used effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This third report, dealing specifically with the role of pharmacists in the health care team and the contribution they can make to improving medicinal use in the community, completes the Committee's inquiry. The report is being tabled at a time when the pharmacy profession is itself conducting a major examination of its present and future role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report responds to the pharmacy professions concerns about its restrictive role, imposed through the PBS remuneration system. There is a need to develop ways of demonstrating to government, other health professionals and the community that other services provided by pharmacists are of financial and general health benefit to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report commences with a brief historical overview of drug dispensing and describes the changing nature of pharmacy and its different representative organisations. Any professional change in direction must be underscored and reinforced by professional training, at both the undergraduate and postgraduate continuing education levels. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive four-year undergraduate course be introduced to replace the existing three-year course plus the preregistration training year. The Committee further recommends that some joint pharmacy-medical training occur to provide a degree of common experience between the professions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the area of continuing education, the Committee recommends that pharmacists be required to undertake professional continuing education in order to be registered. This should assist in keeping the professional knowledge base of all pharmacists current. Such continuing education should be regulated through the Association of Pharmacy Registering Authorities, with courses developed by the Australian College of Pharmacy Practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also examines in greater detail the role of hospital and community pharmacy and the necessity for close cooperation and joint management of patients moving between the two settings. Recommendations are also made to acknowledge the role of community doctors in the pharmacist-doctor relationship. As in the first two reports, the Committee has included a separate chapter dealing with consumer issues and makes specific reference to patient medication records and how they are to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes by looking at the future role of pharmacy, including proposed new role diversification in community pharmacy. Specific reference is made to consultant pharmacists, community liaison pharmacists and pharmacist involvement in drug reviews in nursing homes and hostels. The Committee makes observations about the lack of a national peak body to represent the interests of all pharmacists and recommends that a project be funded to determine the value of pharmacy services to the community and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report provides a brief statement to consolidate the whole inquiry and stresses the need for a more comprehensive examination of the overall cost of drug misuse. This would involve a major exercise to gather data on costs, benefits and effectiveness of drug therapy and would help to bring existing data together in a cohesive way and supplement much of the information which already exists. Government decision making would benefit as a result of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thank the secretariat&mdash;Bjarne Nordin, James Catchpole and secretarial support from Lynette Sebo&mdash;and I thank the members of the Committee for their diligence in this long inquiry, especially the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent), the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). This is the third and final report on the prescription and supply of drugs and deals mostly with the role of pharmacists in their supply of these drugs. It is clear that the role of pharmacists in the community is changing. Their original role was to dispense medicines, to create the medicines and to mix up the potions. That is no longer appropriate for chemists and pharmacists as this is now being done on a basic manufacture basis, and in many cases their role has degenerated into that of typist to put the little label on bottles and hand them over the counter, along with the teddy bears and the shampoo and the toothpaste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a greater role for pharmacists, and that role is now emerging with the great increase of medicines that are available to the community, which is making it extremely difficult for doctors to keep up with and find out what is going on in the huge range of pharmaceuticals they are presented with. The pharmacists are in the best position to have a look at this, to understand what is available, to advise the physicians, and to check what the patients are taking. One of the other problems, as I mentioned in my last tabling speech, is that we have patients and clients who are taking medicines and who are simply not sure what they are taking. There is multi-pharmacy going on and there needs to be some way of looking at this problem. One of the possibilities is that pharmacists be given access to computers, and it is through those computers that they will be checking up on what their clients are taking. As I mentioned last time, this has problems of its own with regard to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern in the pharmacy profession that their expertise is not being used and that there should be a much closer relationship between doctors and pharmacists. The pharmacists are in many cases the referral base for the doctor; people come to the pharmacy and it will be suggested by the pharmacist that they should go to their doctor. We need to intermingle these two roles so that the doctor sees the pharmacist as part of a health care team and can liaise with that pharmacist on the appropriate medicines, and the pharmacist, when she or he has any concerns, can liaise back to the doctor. Pharmacists are in a role where they can give advice to the people who come into their shops because they are in a basic shopfront situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, the Committee has been concerned about the level of communications training for pharmacists. One of the strong recommendations of the report is that there be a specific emphasis on communications in the pharmacy course. This is now the case with the training of physicians, as recommended by us in an earlier report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three reports have covered from the very beginning the whole gamut of what happens in the medicine field in the prescription and supply of drugs. We have highlighted some of the problems, and the end result is that it comes back to the pharmacist. It is the pharmacist who hands the final prescription across the counter, and there is going to have to be much more emphasis put on this role. The Committee is aware that the pharmacists are very eager to take on this role and to take over fully those sorts of responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to commend the secretariat on the excellent job it has done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House and commend to those with a particular interest in electoral matters the statement just tabled. Time constraints in preparing a report on the preparations for the next election have meant that the Committee has not been in a position to go through the full range of issues in as much detail as it would wish under normal circumstances. The Committee has been mindful of the desirability, though, of ensuring that a report be provided to the Parliament before the Christmas period, and has worked very assiduously in providing both the interim report, tabled a little while ago, and the report before honourable members today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the report was finalised by the Committee, the Government has provided a response to the Committee's report on the 1990 elections. The Committee has not been in a position to review that response. I have had a brief view of the Government's response and am pleased to note that many of the recommendations from the Committee in relation to the 1990 elections have been supported by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of aspects of this current report to which I wish to draw particular attention. I refer to paragraph 2.5.7 which deals with the provision of rolls. I do so because it has not been addressed directly in a recommendation but is nonetheless an issue regarded by the members of the Committee as one of some importance. Paragraph 2.5.7 notes that the AEC suggested that the availability of floppy disks for electoral rolls would lessen the need for three hard copies to be provided to honourable members, as specified in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Committee does not support this view and believes that the existing entitlement of three hard copies should be maintained. I am sure all members of the Committee and all honourable members in this place would want me to reassert that position to ensure that current entitlement of a minimum of three hard copies to each honourable member is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, recommendation 10 of the Committee's report deals with the provision of divisional maps, a requirement under the Act at present. Regrettably, both at Commonwealth and State levels there has been a propensity of late to produce electoral maps that do not identify street names. Recommendation 10 deals with that matter and points out the need for divisional maps to identify streets clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queuing was the major problem identified in the 1990 report that affected many people in Australia wishing to vote and was the subject of many complaints from members and senators. The Committee has noted the AEC's decision to change its staffing formula. That should go some way to alleviating the problem, and certainly should rectify many of the difficulties encountered by voters at the 1990 election. The AEC also proposes to adopt a variation in the queuing procedures. For my part, I am not convinced that the changed arrangements for queuing will actually reduce the time taken to vote, but certainly the changed formula will have that effect. The Committee also has noted the need for electoral staff to take heed of the special needs of particular people on election day, notably the aged, those with young children and those with other conditions that may require some particular consideration to be given to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee makes some comments about the recent High Court decision and they are particularly important. Recommendation 4 recommends that the Minister seek an opinion as soon as possible on a number of issues. I particularly want to draw attention to paragraph 3.1.17 where the Committee identifies the need to seek advice in relation to those people holding an office where expenses are offered and those where there is no remuneration at all. I think the High Court decision does place in jeopardy members and senators serving on a number of government and semi-government boards. That matter needs to be clarified. Recommendation 5 relates to the matter of uniform procedures being followed by the States and the Commonwealth on re-employment rights of public servants who stand as candidates in a Federal election. They are important issues which the Parliament needs to address in response to the High Court's decision, and the Committee has recommended that appropriate legal advice be sought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few comments on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ready or not: refining the process for election '93</EMPHASIS>. In Australia we have a very high standard in running our elections, and that should be the case. Nevertheless, there are always improvements which can be made in the public administration of the country and particularly in the area of elections. I support the comments just made by the Chairman of the Committee and I want to mention a few matters in the report for the information of members and senators who may be listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report covers areas such as queuing which, as the Chairman indicated, caused problems in certain parts of Australia. I think one of the reasons for that last time was that the Commission encouraged people to come out early. It was a nice day, people did come out early, and that caused problems at certain stages. In other places, including my electorate, there were no difficulties in that way at all and things ran very smoothly. There is also a recommendation in the report regarding dual polling places. They can cause confusion, and I suggest to honourable members who are interested that they have a look at that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to uniformity of re-employment of public servants in the different States, that is a matter of equity between people in different parts of Australia. The Committee recommends that people working in the public sector and wanting to stand for the Federal Parliament should be treated in a similar manner, no matter which State they live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who get this report also get a copy of the recent decision of the High Court in the case of Sykes v. Cleary. That decision is an important piece of information which many people in Australia may not easily be able to get otherwise, but in this report they have ready access to it. It is a very important decision which affects many people who may want to stand for the forthcoming Federal election. I think there is an obligation for people who may be standing for Parliament not just to read through that but also to read it fairly literally and to be careful as to exactly what they do in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a recommendation in this report that scrutineers be given full and reasonable access to the counting of the votes on election night. We all assume that will happen. Again I emphasise how important it is that that be allowed by electoral officers, whoever they might be and wherever they might be throughout the country. Often only a matter of a couple of minutes makes the difference between people feeling that they have had an opportunity to scrutineer what they want to see and feeling that they have not. I see very little reason for there being any difficulty in this area, but it is an area in which there evidently has been difficulty in some polling booths. There have been officials who have not been as cooperative as they should have been. We are talking about a very important process in the country. It is fundamental to the democratic process that the public have confidence that everything is fair and above board, and it is one of the roles of scrutineers to ensure that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our interim report indicated, this report also provides for the provisional distribution of preferences on the night. That is a major step forward. I think it is going to give us a more accurate picture than we have ever had before in Australia, and I look forward to seeing how this works and whether it comes up with the goods on the night. Obviously, with close elections it will not always enable us to know what the government will be, but I believe the information we will receive on the night will be the best Australia has ever received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility is with the AEC to ensure the smooth operation of polling and of the total election procedures on the day. I am sure that that will be possible as from the next election, and I look forward to everything running smoothly on the day.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This unanimous report on the law enforcement access network, which is more generally known as LEAN, is the first report of the Committee into fraud on the Commonwealth, which matter was referred to the Committee on 30 March this year by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). The report addresses No. 9 of the terms of reference of the inquiry and looks at information exchange and fraud control and the privacy implications of such exchange. It focuses on an examination of the LEAN system, which provides a useful example of how some of those issues arise in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee decided to report first on these matters so that concerns on LEAN could be taken into account when decisions are made on the implementation of the system. LEAN will provide a computer facility to give government agencies with law enforcement and revenue protection responsibilities access to several databases containing company records publicly available Australia-wide and land ownership data for law enforcement and protection of revenue purposes. The project is being developed and implemented by the Federal Justice Office of the Attorney-General's Department to assist in preventing and detecting fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primarily, LEAN will be a facility for accessing and searching the database on the system in one-off searches. However, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Defence propose to use the facility for data matching purposes. The Department of Social Security, while not seeking access to the LEAN system on line, proposes to use it as a source of land data which will be copied onto the DSS computers and matched against DSS client records. The cost to the Attorney-General's Department of implementing the project will be about $29m over three years, plus about $90,000 to each agency linking into the system. In October 1991, the Attorney-General announced that the Commonwealth would be proceeding with the LEAN project as one means of protecting the community from those who break the law and attempt to rip off the taxpayers through welfare cheating, tax evasion and other fraudulent means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee supports the Commonwealth's objective and acknowledges the complexities of the task of implementing the LEAN facilities, the results of the Committee's work have revealed some major shortcomings in the way in which the project is being developed. Firstly, the cost-benefit ratio for the project is about 1:2 over a period of some five years. This is not substantial in monetary terms where the benefits derive largely from the Australian Tax Office's data matching activities. Secondly, negotiations with the State and Territory governments on the provision of the basic land ownership records for the system have not been finalised. No contracts have been signed. Since companies data is already available publicly on line there would seem little point in proceeding with the development of the system if most of the States and Territories do not agree to provide the land data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, privacy issues have been a major concern surrounding the project and a number of key issues such as the rights of the public to know what data is held about themselves, avenues for amending errors to that data, the application of principles of the Commonwealth Privacy Act and data matching arrangements remain unresolved. Fourthly, while the Attorney-General's Department has been successful in keeping the system participants informed on the project, there has been no direct avenue for public input into the system. The efforts to which the Committee had to go on several occasions to get basic information about LEAN have heightened its concern that the LEAN facility is not being developed as openly as it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the basic document guiding the operation of the system&mdash;the memorandum of understanding&mdash;remains incomplete, with administrative arrangements unresolved. Sixthly, the project is now six months behind schedule and is not expected to be operational until mid-1993. Finally, the recent decision by the Attorney-General's Department to cancel the contract of its prime contractor for the Department's legal office information system has added to the Committee's concerns. This raises questions about the Department's general capacity to manage information technology projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the decision that the LEAN facility should go ahead, the Committee has made some major recommendations on the way in which the project should be managed in the future. The key recommendations are that legislation be put in place within the next two years to govern the operation of the system and that the Attorney-General's Department should adopt a more open and public approach in developing and operating the LEAN facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee regards these matters very seriously and considers that the Attorney-General's Department should take immediate steps to address the matters of concern raised in the report. The Committee notes that the preferred tenderer for the project was announced by the Attorney-General's Department last week. The Committee would have expected, however, that these issues should be raised and resolved before a contract was let for this work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost 70 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in cities or towns, yet many perceive urban Aboriginals not to be real Aboriginals. Such inaccurate and negative attitudes disadvantage these people and subject them to strong assimilatory expectations. The denial of their Aboriginality does not countenance the continuous change that occurs within the culture of various societies, particularly through periods of great social upheaval, as experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people during the last 200 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that there is a need to raise public awareness of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society and culture. The indigenous people also have a strong desire for renewal and self-determination. Urban indigenous people seek recognition of their existence, their past and their aspirations, both for themselves and for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban indigenous people seek a recognition of their Aboriginality, that is to say, their separate identity, which has been shaped by the last 200 years as much as by the thousands of years before that. Most wish to take their place in Australia as equals, not as second-class citizens who must deny their identity in order to assimilate into the broader society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major focus of the inquiry into the needs of urban dwelling indigenous people was the delivery of services. Many mainstream services are avoided by urban Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders because of cultural inappropriateness or insensitivity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living outside major cities frequently lack equitable access to local government services. Despite marked improvements in some council areas, other councils have been slow to end discriminatory practices, resulting in Aboriginal people lacking the basic services which are taken for granted by the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improving the relationship between Aboriginal people and local government was a key focus of the inquiry. Recommendations have been made to raise Aboriginal awareness of, and participation in, local government. Improvements to local government include the appointment of Aboriginal liaison officers, the formation of liaison committees, and the establishment of networks to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander counsellors and liaison officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has recommended the setting up of a task force to determine sound rating practices concerning Aboriginal community land. Greater participation and representation in local government matters is essential. Given the deep-rooted nature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational disadvantage, change in education must be a slow process. While substantial improvements have been made in recent years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are still disadvantaged in comparison with the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a comparative neglect of early childhood education, and the Committee has recommended measures to overcome this. There are still far too few indigenous teachers in classrooms. The Committee recommends that a special scheme be introduced to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander early childhood teachers and school teachers. While the introduction of optional Aboriginal study courses in schools has made some progress, the Committee recommends that such courses be made mandatory in schools and in all teacher training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strategies to combat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment disadvantages have had limited success. Statistical targets are being met in the Australian Public Service, but less progress has been made in State and Territory public services. The least satisfactory areas of progress are in local government and the private sector. The Committee has recommended realistic targets for local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers that the problem of Aboriginal employment in the private sector is so intractable at present that an affirmative action program is necessary to require all firms employing over 100 employees to report on steps being taken to promote the employment of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Where the community development employment project scheme has been extended to major urban areas, the organisation of the scheme should be based on projects rather than on the community. Training should be specifically related to the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of housing, overcrowding and the poor standard of housing were problems raised as major issues at virtually every place the Committee visited. The availability and adequacy of housing is a central determinant of the overall living standards, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people still being significantly disadvantaged. Despite a $1.3 billion expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing since 1968, disproportionately large numbers of indigenous people are homeless or in rented accommodation, and only 25 per cent of families own or are buying their houses. We have made substantial recommendations in relation to improving the provision of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cultural identity and awareness of indigenous people is a key to re-establishing their pride and dignity and their capacity to participate in society as equals with non-Aboriginals. The Committee recommends funding for the establishment of cultural centres in urban areas.

What started off as somewhat difficult and controversial subjects ended up gaining general support. I also thank the staff for the extremely long and hard hours that they put in and for the very comprehensive report that was tabled&mdash;which, perhaps, was overshadowed to a small degree by the report on deaths in custody. However, I believe this report makes a very significant contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is determined to see that all the barriers to improving the quality of life of urban Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are removed. For too long, indigenous Australians have lagged behind other Australians. Very few people would have understood that perhaps 70 per cent of the Aboriginal population is urban orientated. That is a figure that I think most Australians would find amazing. Also, the majority of the 99 Aboriginals who died in custody lived in urban communities. Twenty-four were from major urban communities and 35 were from minor urban communities. Perhaps this figure alone would stress the pressures that are on the Aboriginal people living in our major towns and cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to point out that the community is not homogenous. The needs of Aboriginals in Arnhem Land are not the same as the needs of those in Redfern, Fitzroy, Moree or Port Hedland. Aboriginals living more or less traditional lifestyles in remote areas do not face the stresses of the modern Aboriginal community which is living in the urban environment. There is some evidence of a fairly strong shift to living in those areas from the community. I think that that trend will continue in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very gratifying to see that the educational situation for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is improving and that so many Aboriginals have taken on university study for a degree. Along with the Chairman, I fully support the recommendation for training with schools. I believe there should be some system whereby people taken from a community are actually pledged to go back to that community and into community schools for a number of years. Some of the programs of education are twofold. The LINK program and others which have been incorporated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), I believe, will have a great impact on the Australian community in general so that we can bring some dignity to these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the minority report. It is a pity that we had to have a dissenting report, but it was important that the point of view be put forward. One is very sympathetic to the point of view that Aboriginal people have not, by and large, been employed in the private sector. I have made the statement that I have never been sold an ice-cream by or bought a pair of shoes from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. I think this is indicative of their serious under-representation in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report examines the Close Corporations Act 1989 and the general question of the appropriate form of incorporation for small business in Australia. The Close Corporations Act proposed to introduce a new form of incorporation for private businesses with simple operating structure. In recognition of its essentially private nature and simple structure, the close corporation would be simpler to establish and operate than a business incorporated under the Corporations Law. For example, it would not be required to lodge annual accounts with the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence received by the Committee, while supporting the general objective of providing a simplified form of incorporation for small business, gave only limited support to the close corporation. Criticisms of the proposal included: that the restriction on its powers would render it unsuitable for small business; that limited liability could be lost relatively easily; that the structure and reporting requirements of the close corporation remain complex; and that there is no simple process for converting a close corporation into a proprietary company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee acknowledges the force of the criticisms of the close corporation. Thus the Committee favours the introduction of a new corporate form, the private company, through a new chapter in the Corporations Law. It would adopt the best features of the proposed close corporation whilst eliminating those which were the subject of extensive criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was general agreement on the desirable features of a form of incorporation on small business: establishment should be simple and cheap; reporting obligations should be kept to a minimum; the internal administration should be uncomplicated and a simple process for dispute resolution between members should be available; the corporate form should offer the normal benefits of incorporation and be readily understood, both by its owners and third parties; transition to a more complex corporate structure should be simple, to accommodate the growth of the business; and the structure should be tax effective. Much of the evidence favoured reform and simplification of the existing exempt proprietary company, adopting some of the aspects of the close corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that there is a place for both a simple corporate form for small business and the retention, for the time being, of the existing exempt proprietary company for more complex corporate structures. The availability of the exempt proprietary company should be reviewed after a suitable time has elapsed to assess the use being made of the two forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed private company would be limited to a maximum of 10 members, and it is proposed that it not be able to act as a trust or a holding company or to raise funds from the public. The members of a private company would attract limited liability in the same form as any other incorporated body; reporting requirements would be further reduced; provision would be made for the investor who did not wish to be involved in management; and transition between the various corporate forms would be a simple process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with an important dissenting report on one point, which is my dissenting report. The one point of difference which I have with the other members of the Committee is that, in order to facilitate the simple transition between the proprietary form of company and the new private company, the Committee has proposed that the proposal in the original close corporation that would allow a sole trader to incorporate be changed so that there will be a minimum number of two participants in any private company. I think that this excludes the advantage of incorporation to many sole traders. It undercuts the benefit of the private company vehicle very substantially, and it will force traders either to forgo the advantages of such incorporation or to resort to artifice in order to find some other person to be involved in the business, simply for the purpose of gaining this corporate protection. For those reasons I have tabled a short dissenting report on that point. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to prevent what most people consider was a fiasco in the change to the design of the Australian $5 note some time ago by introducing a broader decision making process for such changes than has taken place in the past. The type and design of notes issued have traditionally been relatively conservative. However, in recent times, there has been some experimentation with new types of notes which, in theory at least, have a far greater durability&mdash;although one would suggest that the durability is not as great as was first thought, because of the number of them that have been defaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not in any way reflect on the fact that the monarch has been put on the $5 note. Rather, it reflects on the lack of judgment and historical perspective of the Reserve Bank board, which is elected for its judgment in financial matters and not for its judgment on art and design. This lack of judgment caused the problems at the time of the introduction of the $5 note. The Bill changes the present arrangements only to the extent that a design is required to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament and that that design be subject to disallowance by the Parliament if the Parliament considers that it is not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major reason for the change to the $5 note was not to design a new note but to remove the picture of Caroline Chisholm from it. It was found that there were no mechanisms whatsoever for any input into the design of the new note other than from members of the Reserve Bank board. I find that quite extraordinary. The currency is one of the major symbols of the nation. This Bill has nothing to do with the monarch, and it has nothing to do with whether the design of the current $5 note is good or bad. I think the fairly broad consensus is that most people dislike the note. They are very concerned about the design&mdash;they think the note is terrible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned with the design. At the time that the decision was made to put the Queen on the $5 note&mdash;her picture had been on the $1 note and the $2 note that were discontinued&mdash;there were some 10 or 12 notes in circulation. All of those notes, except for the $5 bill, had depicted on them males who had had a part in Australia's history. There were 11 males and only one female. The Reserve Bank, in what must be classed as an extraordinary error of judgment, decided to replace all of the notes but decided to replace first the only note which bore the depiction of a female. The other notes are, to my knowledge, still in circulation and will be for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill would give the Parliament the opportunity, if it so desired, to advise the Reserve Bank&mdash;by rejecting a design&mdash;that it wanted the bank to submit a design that was considered to be more appropriate for the Australian currency. Other methods of oversight could be used but I think that the Parliament is the appropriate place for such oversight. If the Parliament found a note objectionable it could reject it. Small groups of people disagree with the symbols of the nation as they are presented from time to time, but it is unusual in the extreme for a majority in a House of Parliament to object unless there is a good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that Caroline Chisholm's picture was removed from the note, prior to a complete changeover. She was one of a large number of females in our society who have contributed, or are still contributing, to the development of this nation. There would seem to me to be a good reason to rotate the people featured on the banknote from time to time because there is an almost unlimited supply of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go back to something I raised here about four years ago. When we give jobs to organisations which are not necessarily in communication with the general public, too often the decisions are narrowly made. I was absolutely horrified on Australia Day 1988 when the Order of Australia list came out. This list is devised from a fairly narrow list of people drawn up specifically for that purpose. The list did not make any attempt to recognise the fact that it was the 200th anniversary of Australia and it made no attempt to put forward the most prominent Australians of our history or our generation. In fact, the list was stacked with High Court judges. Australia Day, 26 January 1988, will not go down in history or live forever in my mind as a day on which we honoured the people who made this country great by including them in the Australian award system; we were too busy giving gongs to High Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, I think the Reserve Bank has made a decision based on the tradition that the lowest denomination note bears the face of the monarch, irrespective of who the monarch is, male or female. To that extent, I do not see any problem with its judgment. Its judgment was, however, that it should start a process of replacing banknotes by replacing the lowest denomination banknote, thus removing the only female face on a banknote and leaving 11 males to be replaced at some later date. On that occasion, I believe that, if this Parliament or the Australian community had had a say, they would have said that Caroline Chisholm or another female who had contributed to Australia's history, to Australia's development and to what Australia is should have been honoured by being placed on an Australian note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the Reserve Bank wished, it could have been done quite easily by replacing one of the other notes at the same time as the $5 note. It was not done, and this was because of a lack of sensitivity and because it is quite possible that the problem which arose, the disagreement with the decision, was not anticipated before it became apparent that there was a significant disagreement. The Bill does not reverse the decision that has been taken. It does not in any way endeavour to change the traditional style or shape of our currency, or the right of the Reserve Bank to make recommendations on how our currency should look or from what material it should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the public would like to have a say on these issues sometimes. The Bill provides for the Parliament to have an oversight role in a way that would enable any perceived incorrect or bad design to be reviewed and, if necessary, overturned by the Parliament itself&mdash;by resolution of the Parliament, which is not an easy process. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion for the second reading of the private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the Reserve Bank Amendment Bill. To my knowledge, the removal of Caroline Chisholm from the $5 note has been brought before this House on only one previous occasion, which was the dying stages of the last session of this Parliament. On Thursday, 25 June 1992 I moved, by leave, the following motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses its concern at the decision of the Reserve Bank Board to remove the image of Caroline Chisholm from the design of the proposed new $5 note; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recommends that this decision be rescinded.</PARA>
<PARA>The present Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), seconded the motion and it was resolved in the affirmative. It was a pity that we were not able to have a debate on it at that stage, but we were under very heavy pressure of time to complete the session's business that night, and it was only fairly generous arrangements on the part of both Government and Opposition that got it on the record at all. There was a move to do the same thing in the Senate, and it was not for lack of sympathy that it did not get on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. The Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> was a lot more difficult to break into at that stage of the Parliament than ours. There was a feeling that something had to be said to put on the record concern about the decision of the Reserve Bank board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have subsequently received a letter from, I think, the Chairman of the board and other material such as copies of press releases that the board had put out. It was far too late to influence the matter at that stage. The note was about to be issued and it could not be reversed. That in itself is symbolic of the need for the type of action that the honourable member for Corio is proposing through this private member's Bill. Since then I have had quite a few people ask me who Caroline Chisholm was and what she did that was so important. I have a hunch that that was probably what all the members of the Reserve Bank board were saying to one another when they addressed the subject of the new $5 note. If they had taken any trouble at all to find out about Caroline Chisholm, I feel confident that they could not possibly have removed her from our note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the people who were responsible for establishing modern day Australia, Caroline Chisholm as an individual stands head and shoulders above everybody else. She was an extraordinary woman, apparently possessed of enormous zeal, philanthropic spirit and vision, who moved people at all levels&mdash;the Governor of the colony and very powerful and influential people in London&mdash;specifically on the subject of free immigration. Those of us who did study a little Australian history in the days when one used to learn about these things at school will be aware that the history of the establishment of modern day Australia was very much bound up with the attempts to establish a settlement of free people. People had the vision that this was not to be just a gaol but a land of opportunity where people from Europe and, specifically, I suppose, Britain, who lived in miserable and appalling conditions, had the chance of a decent life. That really was the beginning of the story of modern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caroline Chisholm married a man in the British Army who was posted to India. He took leave and they came to Australia, after being married a short length of time. When she arrived in Sydney she was appalled at the number of homeless people she saw roaming the streets. People were coming here as immigrants, with literally nowhere to live and no way of finding employment. She had two particular concerns. One was protection of the young women who were involved and the other was the establishment and protection of family in Australia. She recognised that if this was to become a stable colony families had to live here. It had to be a good place for women and children. It could not just be for men, be they convicts or people who were knocking over gum trees to plough a little land and plant some wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not help only female immigrants. By persuading the Governor to give her disused barracks, she set up a home where up to 96 people at a time lived and had a roof over their heads. She tirelessly toured the countryside on horseback, visiting people who could give employment to people who would work on farms. She established overnight rest stations for people on their journeys, and was so successful that in a few years that home in Sydney could be closed down. There was no more need for it; she had established a way of getting people to flow into the colony through Sydney and straight into employment. So pleased were employers to welcome the people whom Caroline Chisholm introduced to them that there was no need for a holding centre in Sydney; the people were flowing out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She worked very hard in England as well, and she worked for one very worthy cause. We have all learnt about convicts coming here and becoming ticket-of-leave men, but they could never, of course, go home, and many of those men had families in Britain. Caroline Chisholm was instrumental in arranging a system whereby those men's wives and children could join them in Australia and they could re-establish a stable family life as those men tried to get on with life in a new world which may not have been of their choosing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that Caroline was also the mother of six children. She was doing all these extraordinary things, very fully supported by her husband, as well as being the mother of four sons and two daughters. She did it entirely in a philanthropic spirit. There was nothing in it for Caroline Chisholm or her husband, who in due course retired altogether from the army and worked full time helping her. This is the story of an extraordinary human being and Australia has a lot to thank her for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Reserve Bank board had even looked at the less than a page on Caroline Chisholm that appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Encyclopaedia</EMPHASIS>, and the slightly more potted biography that the Library has supplied me with from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Dictionary of Biography</EMPHASIS>, I cannot believe that it would have taken her off the note. It is no difficulty for me if the Queen is not on the $5 note. I state here that I am a monarchist&mdash;I am not a republican&mdash;simply because I think the system works pretty well for us, mainly because it is over in England; I will say no more about that. The Queen is, after all, on all of our coins, of which we have far too many. I hope one of the spin-offs of this new technology&mdash;we are told we are going to have these notes that will last for ever&mdash;is that the $1 and $2 notes might be brought back. Frankly, I think our currency is in a mess in that sense. There has never been a suggestion that the Queen's head would be removed from all our coins, whatever those coins may be, and I think that is right and proper. The abolition of the $1 note did not distress me for that reason; it distressed me for other reasons. I do not think there was a need to reintroduce the Queen's head on any note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are interested in the subject, Australian currency is very highly regarded throughout the world. We are considered to have well-designed currency, particularly the notes. For example, I know that people with sight disabilities in the United States wish that they had our note system, because in that country all notes are the same size and colour. In Australia our notes have always been different sizes. People whose sight is poor, or who have no sight, can still handle our currency because they can tell the different notes by size. These things&mdash;the quality of the design and colour&mdash;mean that our currency is highly regarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The symbols chosen to put on a nation's currency are important, they are not incidental. In a sense, they follow the decision about the symbols a country puts on its flag; it is saying something by the people it chooses to put on its currency. It is not good enough for the Reserve Bank to say, `Ah, but we have put Dame Nellie Melba on the $100'. That is nice, I am glad it has put Dame Nellie Melba on the $100 note. That is very right and fitting. However, if I had to choose between Melba and Chisholm, in my view it would be no contest. It would be Chisholm. I am not advocating that Melba be taken off the note but, by any stretch, Caroline Chisholm is a woman who, as I have said before, stands head and shoulders above her contemporaries of the time and she should be well honoured always in Australian history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this private member's Bill. I take note of what the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has been saying. We have to ask ourselves what the governors of the Reserve Bank were thinking about. They obviously have very little understanding of Australian history and Caroline Chisholm's role in it, which has been outlined so fully. We even have a college in Cornubia named after Caroline Chisholm and I know that there are quite a large number of colleges and schools throughout Australia named after her because of the kind of woman she was. It seems to me that the Reserve Bank governors show the kind of total disregard for women and women's place in our society that has been accepted by the community for too long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be enlightening for many people to know, particularly here in Canberra, that Walter Burley Griffin's work was done largely by his fiancee, who happened to be an architect. It was she who did almost all the work, rather than him, but, given the nature of the times, he is the person whose name history&mdash;as in `his story'&mdash;records rather than hers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we visit many of our museums and galleries and so on, we find that women's place has very often not been defined within Australian society. I am reminded of a recently published book by one of our leading feminist writers, Dr Dale Spender, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lifelines</EMPHASIS>, which is a collection of letters of Australian women throughout early Australian times. Their contribution to the life of this country, and particularly to its pioneering days, is enormous. They endured heartache, isolation and sorrow in giving birth on their own and in various other aspects of life alone in the bush. It is those kinds of values, it is that kind of fortitude and strength, the creation of family life, which Caroline Chisholm has been so noted for and which was disregarded by the Reserve Bank governors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pertinent for us as a House to note that in the history of the church these are momentous times. In Goulburn this weekend we will see the ordination of the first Anglican women priests and in Brisbane we will see on Sunday night the ordination of that city's first Anglican women priests. So when the rest of society is changing, and even some of the churches are changing and seeing women's roles in a different way, we have to ask ourselves what on earth these governors are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended a momentous historic occasion in relation to the role of women with the ordination and affirmation of Jan Chalmers from Coopers Plains, the first Uniting Church deacon in our area in Brisbane. It is interesting to note that she has been doing that work for 15 years but has only ever had the title of deaconess. The Uniting Church has now seen fit to recognise her in that new role, which shows a ministry of the word and a ministry of community which very many church women have carried out for such a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caroline Chisholm is regarded highly within her own church, the Catholic Church in Australia, and in fact has been put up as a candidate for sainthood. So it is not unfitting for us to look at the kinds of roles played by women in our churches, in our community and in society generally. We would expect to see them as part of the social symbols of modern Australia on our own notes, because all of us are part of the Australian community. It may be worth reminding people that over 50 per cent of our population is now female and, more importantly for members of this House, close to 56 per cent of voters are women&mdash;because we live longer. Perhaps honourable members would like to think about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill and to bring to the attention of the community and of the governors of the Reserve Bank the enormous support for Caroline which our community shares. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I follow the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) with some pleasure. I want to talk about the spirit of Caroline Chisholm. Caroline Chisholm was in the forefront of issues that are still before us every day today. She was an advocate of Aborigines. She was a defender of the rights of Chinese immigrants. All these years later, Australia is still coming to grips with those very issues. I am sure we address them almost on a daily basis in this House and, if not in this House as part of the debate, then certainly we address them around the corridors and in the parliamentary committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caroline Chisholm was worthy of recognition on our $5 note when it was made of paper and not plastic. Some $10m goes into the exercise of changing a note. Here we are debating what would have been seen by the governors of the Reserve Bank, I am sure, as a very simple change that would not be noticed by many members of the Australian community. As the honourable member for Forde mentioned, 56 per cent of Australian voters are women, and there should have been some emphasis on the fact that this woman was already on the note. Sometimes conventions such as the Queen being on the note of the lowest denomination do not have to be followed. Perhaps we should have been saying that this is a convention that exists on the $5 note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise the spirit of Caroline Chisholm. That spirit survives today in every electorate. In every electorate in Australia we have women with the spirit of Caroline Chisholm who take up issues that not everybody in the community takes up. I will not name names, but in the Wonthaggi area in my electorate there is a group of women that has taken on the issue of youth and drugs. With no personal benefit to themselves, with no government funding, they have formed a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those women confronted the local editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sentinel-Times</EMPHASIS> and said, `We are going to draw to the attention of our community this issue of drugs&mdash;be it cigarettes, alcohol or the harder forms of drugs. We are going to educate our children and their parents and the community as a whole about how to deal with this difficult issue'. That is the spirit of Caroline Chisholm working at grassroots level. They are the people at the forefront of changing Australia and changing it to the sort of society that we want to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These debates are a great learning experience. I must say that, if I had been asked a couple of years ago, or even last week, who the woman on the $5 note was, I could not have said that it was Caroline Chisholm. I think I would reflect the Australian community in that. The $5 note was worth a lot more, by the way, before this Government was elected. However, I do not want to politicise this debate any more than it should be. I do not think the Reserve Bank governors deserve the belting they have received today on this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House urges the Government to recognise the urgent need to rapidly increase the number of true enterprise employment agreements so as to help stimulate economic and employment-generating activity in Australia's devastated economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The key to this debate is the definition of true and genuine enterprise agreements between two parties. Enterprise agreements are not an enforced deal negotiated by the union movement. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deregulated the financial markets in his term as Treasurer, but in his terms as Treasurer and as Prime Minister he has been unwilling to deregulate the labour market. The well known and respected commentator Professor Judy Sloan of Flinders University says that Labor has re-regulated the labour market. The training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee charges are two examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two very different models offered to the Australian people as to how their arrangements in individual workplaces should be organised, as this motion clearly demonstrates. On this side, we will put forward the argument that the Government is trying to run the comparison as being very much the same. Professor Sloan and her colleague Mark Wooden, a specialist in labour relations, wrote an article in the September 1992 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Bulletin of Labour</EMPHASIS>. This is a very interesting quotation, covering the major thrust of our whole argument:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall . . . we conclude that the current vision of enterprise bargaining held by the ACTU and the Labor government does not involve a radical change in the way labour relations are conducted in this country . . . The alternative vision (of the coalition) . . . the bottom line is that workers (or their designated representatives) will be able to negotiate directly with management about the issues that are important to them.</PARA>
<PARA>This sums up the policy differences quite clearly. The Liberal and National parties are believers in the right of freedom of association. We also believe that closed shops should be outlawed, as should union preference clauses, which give a legal status to unions in awards as well as in the position of negotiators. Most of all, the coalition believes that individual employers and employees are sensible enough to come to decisions about the conditions which are to apply in each workplace, to the mutual advantage of both parties. This does not mean that there is no role for unions. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, (Mr Howard), has made this quite clear. Responsible unions will have a place in industrial relations in Australia, provided they look after the interests of both the employers and their own members in a responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need to allow Australians to negotiate real enterprise employment agreements that are voluntarily entered into by both parties and not forced by the union movement. That is a key phrase, as the honourable members opposite would fully understand. The Opposition and the governments in New South Wales, New Zealand and Victoria have all proposed slightly different models, but the essential thrust is the same: to give employers and employees a choice as to which arrangements are most suitable for their particular workplace. Laura Tingle of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> recently summed up this Government's confusion in commenting on the subject of my motion when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government seems least certain (in the area of) . . . the labour market. This now seems to be . . . where short term expediency could most put at risk the reform process. There is not any totally credible rationale for what the government is doing at present with the award process, nor one to justify its claims that award and union restructuring have been a success.</PARA>
<PARA>Labor's so-called enterprise bargaining is a corruption of the term. In October 1991 the national wage case decision of the Industrial Relations Commission laid down the rules, but section 134, which replaces section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act, says that only a certified trade union can make an enterprise agreement with an employer. What a remarkable position, where only a trade union can make a certified agreement. I think members of the public are unaware of this fine print arrangement. Most people have an understanding that an enterprise agreement is a genuinely negotiated document between an individual and an employer, and yet under the present industrial arrangements we have to fit in with the law under section 134. Section 134 really replaces section 115, which allowed enterprise agreements to be put in place in bigger manufacturing companies such as ICI at Botany Bay and Alcoa in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These agreements have allowed for annualised payments while removing many of the existing allowances and rorts. Penalty rates for weekend work were removed in the annualised salaries and&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;most of the plant's maintenance was able to be performed during the 38-hour week. Most of the workers, who are now on annualised salaries, did not find the need to return for weekend work because they knew full well that they should do most of that maintenance work during the 38-hour week. So there have been some major changes in those plants. I have actually inspected them and found them to be working very satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in a recent so-called critique of the Opposition's Jobsback policy, claimed that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has been given a central role by the Government in what the Minister calls Labor's enterprise agreements. Exactly: that is the fundamental problem we perceive. The Government and the union movement are still involved in the enterprise agreement arrangements that are proposed. I note that Bill Kelty of the ACTU declared that the April 1991 national wage case decision was vomit. That is a well known remark, when the Secretary of the ACTU had his falling out with the President of the IRC, Mr Justice Maddern. In a telephone call to the President in relation to the awards being brought down by the Industrial Relations Commission at that time, he said, `What you are going to do is screw the ordinary workers into the ground'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no room for the 70 per cent of the private sector work force who are not unionised to come to a sensible agreement with their employers because under section 134 the union must be involved. There is no provision that would cover all but one of Gazal's 145 clothing employees coming to a sensible agreement with their employer when that Gold Coast factory was in trouble recently. Most honourable members would be aware of that well publicised case, where the workers tried to come to an agreement, tried to keep their jobs, but the union movement would not allow them to agree to a sensible arrangement that had been worked out by the staff association. The clothing union and the union secretary, Anna Booth, would not allow that sensible arrangement to take place. There was no room also for the Metway Bank Staff Association to be an official part of the system. This staff association, which has the active support of the vast majority of Metway staff, wished to enter an agreement that would have bypassed the designated union official. Again, that was not allowed to happen, although it would have been an advantage to both parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's corrupted version of enterprise bargaining focuses on the central role of the ACTU and its chieftain, Bill Kelty, along with major employers, in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The resignation of a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Ken Turbet, on 14 April this year showed just what is wrong with the Government's lack of vision. Mr Turbet, a well known Labor sympathiser and supporter, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called accord process has been manipulated to such an extent that it is only the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACTU who are now involved in its decision making procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>What a remarkable observation. In its insistence under section 134 of the Industrial Relations Act that a so-called agreement must be made by a registered trade union, the Government shows its hand, with Prime Minister Keating and his political ally Bill Kelty calling all the shots under these enterprise agreements. This is the most important point about the Government's policy position as compared to the coalition's view. These arrangements exclude the 60 per cent of employees who are not unionised. In the current arrangements, all those people who prefer not to join a union are not allowed to have an enterprise agreement under the Government's regime. This is a pathetic arrangement where only 300 of the so-called enterprise agreements have been registered to date and they cover only 5 per cent of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also says that employees must not be disadvantaged by their so-called sham enterprise agreements. In his initial comments on the coalition's visionary Jobsback policy, the Minister for Industrial Relations claimed that the `no disadvantage' test is central to the new certified agreement provisions. We have had long discussions in this House about the Government's attitude to those arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on industrial relations at the present time is about whether we maintain, for working men and women, an award system that is the envy of the world, or whether we go back to the Masters and Servants Act of last century in Britain. The industrial relations debate is about whether we go back to the days when people got on their hands and knees and begged for a job paying $3 an hour; and it is about whether kids go up chimneys or back into mines, as many of our forefathers had to do. It is about whether we maintain dignity for the working men and women of this country and ensure the democratic right of people to sell and bargain their labour, with an independent umpire and with a union movement that is dedicated to protecting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the new attack on workers' conditions did not start in Victoria at all: it started where it all began, 100 years ago, in the pastoral industry in Queensland. About 18 months or two years ago, it started with the intent of a group of people, backed by an organisation called Troubleshooters and a parasite called B.J. Hammonds, to break down award conditions for workers in the shearing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major substance of what I want to say today is not so much about the industrial relations debate as it is about a tribute to a man called Alec&mdash;Blue Gown&mdash;Walton, who became the President of the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union. He passed away on 19 February 1990. He was publicly attacked only two weeks ago in Charleville, because of the stand he took and the dedication he had to Australian shearers and to working people across the State of Queensland, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Blue Gown could be attacked, more than two years after he has passed on from this world, for defending Queensland shearers and other Australian shearers and fighting for a decent go, highlights the differences in views and philosophy which are under the surface, and which have bubbled to the surface in the pastoral industry over the last few months. Alec worked as an AWU organiser for many years, work which culminated in his election as Queensland Branch President. He organised in the far north of the State, and finally came back to settle in his beloved south-west of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most touching commentaries on Alec Walton was made by his contemporaries when they said, `You've never experienced a real friendship until you've known "The Gown" as your friend'. I have had a beer with Blue Gown, at the Embassy Hotel, which was and is the favourite watering hole of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland, and I am pleased to say that he was a friend of mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various versions exist as to how Alec's name of Blue Gown was arrived at, but most people know that he was a boxer of some note in the early days, and was happy to take on all comers in Jimmy Sharman's troop, and of course was happy to defend workers' rights out there in the shearing sheds. I think his family can be very proud of the record that he set. The people who discredited and criticised him a few weeks ago will not long be remembered, but Blue Gown Walton will be remembered with pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When criticism is levelled at people for defending workers' rights they can wear that criticism as a badge of honour. It is something they can be proud of because most battlers, most workers, have very few people to defend them. They do not have the Establishment. They do not have wealth. They do not have power. All they have is the union they belong to, a belief in a fair go and a belief in decency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blue Gown Walton epitomised those values. I want to pay tribute to him today in this debate more than anything else and let the people of Charleville know that we who support unions can be proud of him. I am proud to be a member of the Australian Workers Union and to have been a friend of Blue Gown Walton. His family can be very proud of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to coming into this House today to speak on this debate, I rang up a great mate of mine, Gerry Goding. Gerry is in his mid-80s and was a district secretary of the Australian Workers Union for many years. He is a man who dedicated all his life to defending the rights of workers. I said to Gerry that I was going to stand up and pay tribute to Blue Gown. In the industrial relations debate that is going to take place across the country between now and the next election it is important that we recognise the people who have fought for the rights of Aussie workers since the time of the Depression, through the war years and through the 1950s and 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions that workers enjoy today did not just happen; they came about as a consequence of the efforts of people such as Blue Gown Walton, Gerry Goding and his two old mates&mdash;Alf Cane and Edgar Williams. Between them they have over a century of service to the AWU. Their lives have been dedicated to the battlers and to the shearers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often had letters&mdash;and I think honourable members on the other side of the House should recognise this&mdash;from shearers who cannot get a job because they have a union ticket and they will not work for less than the award rate of pay. One shearer from Longreach wrote to me and said, `I have four kids and my wife is going to have our fifth child, but I am a member of the union and I will not scab and I will not work for less than the award rate of pay because it is the law'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can be pretty proud of those sorts of people. They do not have a voice. They do not have the grammar school tie. They do not have all the trappings that go with the Establishment, but they are the people who make this country great. As I have said, the Gerry Godings, the Alf Canes, the Edgar Williamses and the Blue Gown Waltons are the people who fought for them and took the criticism. I think it is a tribute to `Blue Gown' that he is still copping criticism today, two years after he passed on. </PARA>

They knocked around together in central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One notable thing about the union movement, and the AWU in particular, is the tradition that exists and the determination that exists amongst its members that they are not going to lie down and roll over like the New Zealanders may have done in regard to industrial relations. When people say that New Zealand is an example of a successful experiment, let us look at the New Zealanders. They have voted with their feet and moved to Australia. There are 288,000 of them here today, and the reason they are here is that they do not want to cop a tory government and they do not want to cop such industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise in support of, and to congratulate, my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) on his excellent motion. It really deserves the attention of all thinking Australians. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) is absolutely correct when he says that the battleground for the next Federal election will be industrial relations. It will be all about whether we are going to continue to live in the past, whether we are going to continue to live with a snowballing, rising debt, and whether we are going to be able to service that debt. It will also be about our falling living standards, our increasing unemployment, and whether we are going to make the transition to create an open economy that gives Australians a chance to create jobs, jobs, and more jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler is a true conservative from the Labor side of politics&mdash;living in the past, refusing to accept or acknowledge the desirability and the necessity for change in the rapidly moving and rapidly progressing international environment that is now embracing our economy. I remind the honourable member for Hinkler that the wall is gone. It was his side of politics that tore down the tariff wall and exposed our island continent to the economies of the world. The honourable member for Hinkler, as a true historian, has himself become history. He wants to live in the past, behind the tariff wall that no longer exists. Like the true conservatives, he wishes that we could bring back the glories of the past, the fights and the battles, those vainglorious days of the true history of his union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Hinkler that those days are dead and gone, finished and buried. The way forward into the twenty-first century is to deregulate our labour market, and deregulate it must or perish we will. The rest of the world will not sit around and wait for us. They will move on and they will become increasingly competitive in a world that is not so hungry for the things Australia has to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is about re-regulating the industrial relations system, not deregulating it. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is today bringing forward into the Senate an industrial relations Bill&mdash;which we will debate at a later hour&mdash;that acts to further re-regulate and centralise the control of this system. The system itself gives such power and such a monopoly of rights to trade unions as bargaining agents that it denies the intelligence and the ability of individuals to have any idea of what might be best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is so stifling that in many instances in small, medium and large industries we find work forces constrained by the centrality rule, which requires people to work in one city as people work in another when their local environment demands something quite different. They may well want to work differently and for different wages and conditions, but this centrality rule, this prescribed award system, prevents them from so doing. The union bureaucracy sticks its hand in and says, `We cannot have a microcosm of change at one level, in one workplace. The whole system will crumble and fall like the tower of Babylon if we allow so much as one grain of sand to be shifted'. So the award system becomes inviolable. We must protect it at all costs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This need not be simply an academic debate. We have seen in very recent times Liberal industrial relations policy in action. We have seen in Victoria what Liberal industrial relations policies actually mean. We have even had differing views from individual spokesmen in the Opposition about what they believe in relation to the Kennett policy. At one point they are saying that what Kennett has done is a bit wrong and they will back away from it; at another point they are 99 per cent or 100 per cent behind it. But they certainly do agree with the basic thrust. What has been the basic thrust of industrial relations policy in Victoria under Mr Kennett and his Government? Get through all the rhetoric and decode all the symbolism and all the language. What has it meant? It has meant reducing wages, taking away people's leave loading, attacking their penalty rates&mdash;that is, pay them less&mdash;and attacking their conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system of enterprise bargaining means to the Opposition that employees will be paid less, that in terms of production employees are getting too large a slice of the cake and that a bigger slice should be going to the owners. That is the effect of what Opposition members are saying, but they attempt to cloak it in the terms of the great Liberal tradition. They say, `What we are interested in is freedom: freedom of association, the ability to go out there and negotiate with one's employer and come to a mutually agreeable solution'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the rhetoric of the Opposition, and that is the rhetoric of Jeff Kennett. He put out his campaign leaflets and brochures saying, `We guarantee that no-one will be worse off. We guarantee that we will not cut people's leave loadings. We guarantee that there will be no attack on penalty rates'. When those leaflets and letters went out to the people of Victoria, maybe some people stupidly relied on what they said. The reality was an attack on their wages and conditions that means, `I want to pay you less'. That is exactly what the Federal Liberal Party people are all about. Do not listen to what they say now; do not get sucked in by all the rhetoric of freedom of association. Look instead at their actions and at the reality. The reality is that they want to pay people less, they want to attack people's conditions. That is why the interesting debate between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong is so important to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see what changes to the Jobsback policy come out of tomorrow. It has not been GST on food or other complications with the GST which has seen the absolute collapse of the Liberal Party; it has been its Federal industrial relations policy. Its release has coincided with the actions of Jeff Kennett in Victoria. People know what the Liberals really mean, because they can see their policy in action.

In regard to industrial relations, there is no doubt that we have to trust the men and women and the young people of this country and the employers to work together instead of having a monopolistic approach by the union movement, which thinks that unions are the only ones who can ever represent the workers. They are not. Many of the workers can represent themselves or ought to be able to choose somebody else to represent them, rather than having the monopolistic power of all-powerful unions. They are one of the reasons why this country is stuffed. It has been stuffed by the Labor Party. That is the reality of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard an extraordinary speech from the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). He talked about New Zealand versus Australia. The New Zealand economy is still at the level it was in 1987. It has not grown in five years. The Australian economy is growing faster than that of any other OECD country. It is simply a misrepresentation to talk as the honourable member did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has great pleasure in trying to create an artificial sense of crisis about Australia and about Victoria. It continually quotes figures about debt. The fact of the matter is that Australia has less government debt as a proportion of national income than any other Western country. There is no industrialised mixed capitalist economy with less government debt as a proportion of GDP than Australia. That is true not only of the Commonwealth but also of the States and local government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not want facts. Those opposite are concentrating on building up a sense of crisis in order to justify their extraordinarily regressive, destructive and conflict ridden policies. The policies of the Victorian Government, as would the ones which a Hewson government would introduce if it ever got the opportunity to do so, involve a massive shift of power from the employees to employers. If one looks at the figures for industrial conflict in Australia, one finds that already it is managerial policy which is the principal cause of conflict. Those are the figures from the impartial Australian Bureau of Statistics. If the Kennett policies were applied nationally, that would be the normal course of events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no industrial relations crisis in Victoria. Victoria has a particularly low level of industrial conflict. Of course, Australia, under the accord, has had a very low level of conflict as well. One of the great benefits of the accord has been that we have had a consultative approach&mdash;not only to industrial relations policy but to economic and social policy generally. The employers, the employees and government have all been involved at each level of policy making in advising and deciding how economic and social policies should be made. The result of that has been that we have had less industrial stoppages and fewer hours lost than at any other time in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a major improvement in industrial relations under the consensual policies of the Labor Government. The extraordinarily regressive and aggressive policies of the Victorian Government are generating massive conflict. If one wants higher productivity in the workplace, a necessary condition of that is a cooperative approach&mdash;not the kind of assault on working conditions that the Kennett Government is trying to generate. That is one of the central reasons why the policies are so inept. They are creating conflict where it previously did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, those opposite are talking about the need to increase flexibility. But flexibility for what? Flexibility, in their view, for the employer to exploit the employee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)declares that urgent action is needed to deal with organised crime, death and the health and social problems associated with illegal drug use; and</PARA>

<PARA>Illegal drugs are not the major drug problem in Australia. They are overshadowed by the health and social problems arising from the wrong use of legal medicines and the sickness, death and personal debility arising from alcohol and tobacco. Drugs such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines are different in that they have brought about murders, theft, black markets, violence in foreign countries from criminal cartels, and enticement of children and youth to use and sell drugs. Very often the first dose is free for the young person being enticed onto drugs. All this happened between the late 1950s, when the drugs were prohibited, and now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announcement that I would move this motion, I have received overwhelming support. The main opponents are ostriches, and there are plenty of them; the Mafia, who would quite happily fund the ostriches in their campaign against legalisation; and those who have not studied the issue but are suspicious. I thank doctors and pharmacists in Eden-Monaro who have contacted me, every one with encouragement and advice&mdash;Dr Marjorie Cross, Dr Tom Gavranic, Bruce Mitchell and Van Doherty. Bruce has had experience in the methadone program and Van and his father, prior to the prohibition in the 1960s, had pharmacy experience with drug addicts, experience which was similar to my own. Ian Mathews, the former editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, Peter Hiscock and many people involved in rehabilitation have expressed their support, and I am delighted to see Ian in the gallery today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) will second the motion. He has been an Olympic contestant and has also been much involved in community health. Another Olympic contestant, Kyra Grunsund, of the World Disabled Olympics, wants to move away from the present hopelessness, just as the honourable member for Perth does. The ostriches include some drug addicts and a small minority of those who help them. I was an ostrich myself once, when in a Victorian referendum I supported retention of 6 o'clock closing of pubs. I was proven wrong by a dramatic improvement in the street environment around 6 p.m. in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, objections have also come from people who have not looked at the issue. On Monday, a number of Jerangle people came to see me on my visit to Jerangle and said that they wanted to know more about it, because they would have thought that tougher legislation ought to be tried, that there was no way we could not control people by tougher legislation. It has been tried. It is being tried in Thailand, the United States and many other countries. Unfortunately, there is always someone who can be bought; there are always problems. It is now beyond the ability of law enforcement to control the war on drugs that has been going on for 25 years. It has not been won in any country, but generally it does less well where there is prohibition than where there has been some form of legalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fox and Mathews, in their book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drugs Policy: Fact, Fiction and Future</EMPHASIS>, printed this year, which I can recommend, have pointed out that the United States might be one of the greatest opponents of legalisation. I am hopeful that, with the change of administration in the United States, there will be more reality in its attitude to other countries and particularly to its own drug problem. The most vociferous opponents of the sort of action I recommended at the national drug summit were Brian Burke, who said, `Nonsense', and Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who said, `Foolish'. But people such as George Shultz, the US Secretary of State, and former Australian judge Russell Fox believe that prohibition has failed and that another approach is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to rely on well known people. People lived in, worked in and visited Kings Cross, Sydney, in the 1950s when heroin, cocaine and amphetamines were not prohibited. In the 1950s, the difference was that addicts were older and their addiction generally followed opiate or other medicinal treatment. As reported in the United States <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dialogue</EMPHASIS> magazine of April 1992, there were no more opium addicts per capita when opiates were legal than there were when they were illegal. The drugs were not prohibited. They were available on prescription and their addictions were under medical supervision. What illegal drugs did to Kings Cross has been done, to a lesser extent, to other parts of Australia. As Franklin P. Adams said of US prohibition:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's left a trail of filth and slime,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's filled the land with vice and crime,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It don't prohibit worth a dime.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that prohibition reduced total alcohol consumption, but the horrors associated with it made it the worse evil. There are a lot of problems associated with illegal drug use today. Workers in the drug area, such as Alex Wodak, Les Drew and Chesher, have highlighted them. Prostitution is linked to drugs. Somebody on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in 1988 said, `I would do anything to get money for drugs. I need $300 a night, so that's six people'. Health problems are associated with them, as with other drugs, but the problem with the illegal sale of drugs is that there are people who adulterate them with strychnine and talcum powder and so on. That makes people shoot up; instead of taking the drugs orally, they use intravenous injections, and this makes them overdose in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HIV is another problem. Mr John White, the former Tasmanian Minister for Health, has told me that HIV could cost Australian taxpayers up to $400,000 per person. Associated with HIV is the misery and the high social and health costs as well as the financial costs. In Holland it is estimated that 30 per cent of intravenous drug users have HIV. Dependence affects people in the workplace, at home and in their social life, with disruption to society when people have to find $5,000 a week, on average, to pay for their addiction. That is how much the 129 drug addicts surveyed in Australia said it cost. Under the proposals I am making, that amount could be brought down to $200 a week to live on and take the medication, instead of $5,000 a week to live on and take the drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drug addiction also causes crimes against other people, ranging from stealing handbags to murder. Other problems are the propping up of fragile governments, the enticement of youth on the streets, and the high cost of insurance. John White, the former Minister for Health in Tasmania, was proposing to take this matter to the Council of Ministers. That is what we want to happen. In this motion, the honourable member for Perth and I are moving that the matter be taken to the council of Ministers, just as Mr John White was intending to do. A task force should be formed to determine a uniform approach. There cannot be one rule in the ACT and another in Queanbeyan, for instance. There cannot be one rule in Tasmania and another on the mainland. As Mr White said, people would move to Tasmania. We cannot afford to have different policies. We have to have a uniform approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some excellent ideas have been brought forward. They include bringing the drug addiction problem under public health policy rather than regarding it as a crime; having doctor and pharmacist participants trained; linking up with rehabilitation to look at the real problems of inadequate family role modelling, problems with self-esteem, school, and youth unemployment. Legalisation will not help promote self-control, but people do need to learn to take charge of their lives, and that can be done under this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could look at a different range of opportunities. For instance, Fox and Mathews have recommended the availability of a consumer card on application. There could be an administrative cost charge. There should be a reasonable profit. The drugs should not be free, as they are in the United Kingdom, where admittedly 7,000 out of 35,000 heroin addicts purchase legally and there is less crime and less AIDS, but it does create another area of selling because people get them free. So there should be a reasonable cost, perhaps with a tax on them, as recreational drugs such as alcohol and tobacco are taxed, but not enough to make a black market worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Users need to be encouraged not to transfer to another drug like methadone because that has not worked well in Australia. Perhaps the same drug could be used in another form, like heroin syrup. A doctor and I dispensed plenty of heroin and we phased it down from 100 per cent to 10 per cent in a year with the cooperation of the users. I strongly commend the motion to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking now about the supposed reasons why legalisation should occur. The other arguments that have been put forward are that drug laws are an evil plot of the new world order, or that they are only attractive because they are illegal. All of these arguments have been completely discredited. But now we have new calls, due partly to frustration, about the cost of law enforcement and the inability of authorities to control drug related crime, and because it has not been completely controlled so therefore we should change tack. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat, the word `legalisation' was used repeatedly by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The physician responsible for most of the activity in Sweden when it was reviewed two years later in 1967 had prescribed a total of 600,000 doses of opiates and four million doses of central stimulants to an average of only 82 patients over a period of two years. Statistics show that at the beginning of treatment, individual patients received an average of 1,000 doses per month. Six months later it was 2,000 doses per month. After two years, prescribing it had reached 3,000 doses per patient per month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, in an interview at the end of that period in 1967, a number of interviews were carried out and people arrested. One quarter declared that they had bought or received illicit drugs from somebody they knew to be obtaining these drugs legally. That is, this system that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Perth are pushing actually supplies the black market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the UK a similar system was put forward to manage a small number of addicts. From 1960 to 1968 the number of users under this system doubled every 18 months because massive overprescription created an illicit market, with addicts selling surplus supplies to young people who sought physicians willing to prescribe opiates to them. Physicians were giving addicts as much as they demanded, and from 1,000 addicts at the start of 1960 there were 80,000 addicts by 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Netherlands has a strange system. It is a de facto legalisation system where people turn a blind eye to the illegal use of cannabis and prosecutions are not put forward for the use of hard drugs. In this climate the use of drugs in the Netherlands has got out of control. For example, 15,000 West German drug addicts reside permanently in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. Each year the bodies of at least 40 are carried back across the border. It is such a great problem that there is a special unit in Amsterdam set up by the Dutch Government to locate German addicts and send them home. The Netherlands has the highest criminality rate in Europe and is No. 4 on the world list. Those attempts have clearly failed and there is no shortage of examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument about alcohol is often raised, but there is a major difference with regard to the prohibition of alcohol, which was never a morally consensual arrangement. People basically thought that alcohol had always been used and should continue to be used. There is an argument that the illicit market might be eliminated. It is just possible that that might occur and that the black market on drugs might be reduced but a black plague of drug addiction, overdose deaths and crime would sweep the nation instead. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to take care of drug legalisation and street crime. Cheaper legal drugs lead to an increase in the level of violent and property crime because drug users commit crime to obtain drugs, regardless of price. In the United States, crack is only $3 a dose, but violent crime has skyrocketed. Amsterdam has found that de facto legalisation has led to a wave of theft and vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would drug legalisation impact on demand? Many legalisation advocates admit that there would be a temporary rise but say that this factor is mitigated by some blind faith that some natural level would be reached. But experience in these other countries shows that one cannot be pro-legalisation and hope to discourage drug use by youth. It is putting a stamp of approval on the use of drugs. Experience with alcohol shows that, once a drug is legal for adults, it cannot be kept from kids. Those are incontrovertible facts. Drug legalisation will result in more people experimenting with drugs, more experimenters becoming regular users and more users becoming addicts. Drug laws do deter people. In a study in the United States the main reason for not indulging in drugs was fear of getting in trouble with the law and acquiring a criminal record. The facts are very simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the matter of what happens about the legal onus and who actually takes responsibility should a drug addict die as a result of a legally prescribed drug. The Government seems to have a very great faith in doctors. There are 80 doctors and 30 nurses in New South Wales alone who are banned for illegal use of narcotics at present. What would happen if that number were increased?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is to be done about casual users? There are 60,000 to 90,000 casual users. Would one have to force them to become addicts and registered so that they could get their supplies? Does one tell them they have to go back to the black market? It is a nonsense. It is also a breach of international conventions. There is no doubt that proponents of this approach understate the potential costs and overstate the potential benefits. The bottom line is that, if availability is increased, consumption is increased, especially amongst those who are vulnerable&mdash;and that means our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is an increase in the consumption of alcohol, there is a higher social cost and a higher public health cost, and the same thing will apply to narcotic drugs. The current drug crisis has been stratified amongst the poor and the near poor and this is the very group that education and drug treatment are least effective with. This is the group that we need to particularly look after and protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many addicts become involved not because they are addicts; they are involved in criminal activities prior to becoming addicted. There are some interesting issues here which seem to be ignored. We know that an increase in alcohol consumption does relate to higher costs and the same thing will apply to drugs. It is important that we look at the higher rates of both crime and addiction. Because people were involved in criminal activity before they were addicted, it is clear that the high rates of crime and addiction have become embedded in social and cultural roots. So the effects of drug criminalisation are becoming confused with those of social deprivation. People use the example of Sweden, saying that criminalisation carries no cost. But the fact is that Sweden does not have large numbers of poor kids killing each other on the illegal market because Sweden does not have large numbers of poor kids. </PARA>

Her duties are very basic: typing invoices and answering the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The victimisation of Heidi resulted in a telephone call from my production supervisor to me at my electorate office. I spoke to Commissar Colin requesting that he wait, or return in an hour and a half, as I had electorate matters to attend to, but Colin said he could not wait. No doubt other hapless victims of the ASC's Gulag Archipelago had to be lined up for more treatment&mdash;the Third Reich revisited treatment. I forbade him from taking any documents unless I was present as the person in authority. On concluding the conversation, Commissar Colin again pursued Heidi, threatening her verbally with a $10,000 fine or six months in gaol if she did not provide the documents he demanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissar Colin also attempted to physically restrict Heidi's movements by following her around the small office in an intimidating and threatening manner. I was compelled to postpone my electorate work and return to my business, where I found three very frightened staff members, two of whom had been accused of hindering ASC investigations. It was only then that the KGB standover man Commissar Colin left my premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company tax returns requested by the ASC had been faxed to them at Gestapo headquarters about a week before, in two volumes, as we were advised that 15 pages had not been received. Nothing then was heard until the arrival of the jack-booted Commissar Colin last Friday. This thug and his Gestapo mates should spend a few minutes perusing their own investigations manual. It may surprise them to learn that chapter 6, paragraph 3.10 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No express power of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigators must be aware that they have only a common law right of entry onto premises.</PARA>
<PARA>Needless to say, form No. 2 does not state this&mdash;an outrageous omission, in my view. It may also surprise them to know that, from a legal point of view at least, the Commission is not meant to be a latter-day secret police. It is not an extension of the East German Stasi, the NKVD, the KGB, the Cheka or the Gestapo. Its charter does not include intimidation and terrorism of innocent citizens. Not only did Commissar Colin remove additional copies of the business tax returns, but he also took information I had already given quite willingly to the ASC. On Friday, the documents were stolen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several months ago the Commission was given access to a large number of invoices, without any form No. 2. They simply asked, and I complied. None of my original documents has been returned, despite the fact that the ASC's own manual clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law provides that the investigator may retain books as long as is necessary to make copies or take extracts. Investigators should make themselves familiar with the provisions of this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .              . . .              . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the legislation may give the investigator certain rights, be considerate of the needs of the person who is producing the documents. Try to avoid inconveniencing them.</PARA>
<PARA>Some inconvenience! Assuming that standover man Grant and the terrorists at Gestapo headquarters can read, why is the organisation acting in direct contravention of the law of the land? This situation, with terror tactics directed against innocent victims, is nothing more than a blatant attack on me as a member. It is absolutely unacceptable to have to ask the Victoria Police for advice and a means of preventing further harassment and intimidation of my staff&mdash;my female staff in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appalling saga of injustice is only one aspect of the ASC's behaviour. Some weeks ago, the Liberal Party State Director received an anonymous phone call from a person with detailed knowledge of my small family business. Such a phone call could have come only from the ASC. Earlier this year a very distorted interpretation of my business affairs was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Again, it could have come only from the ASC. So much for the confidentiality requirements outlined in annexure 2.1 of the ASC's manual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 November I drew the attention of the House to the plight of the agricultural engineering industry. My small family company is part of that industry. I have survived in spite of an abrupt change in government policy, high interest rates and a depression, but it has not been easy. While group tax is outstanding, all other creditors have been paid. The name of the trustee company was changed several years ago to prevent malicious rumours from affecting the business in Dandenong. That is another matter. In the old company there are assets available, the value of which is many times the outstanding liability. The ASC has the power to realise these assets, yet it has done nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new trustee company always had to pick up the liability of the old trustee company, and the value of this company is also many times larger than the debt; but I have been instructed not to sell or do anything to diminish the value of this asset. I have asked Glen Cook on several occasions what he is investigating. I have asked why the assets of the old or the new company are not sold to pay the debt. `Only when the investigations are complete', he says. In other words, there is a debt that can be paid by selling assets over which I have no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, there are several other aspects to this horrendous situation which must be placed on the record. Glen Cook has told my accountant that this investigation is, and I quote, `a witch-hunt'. Since when has the ASC or any other government organisation been empowered to conduct witch-hunts against the citizens of the Commonwealth? In these circumstances it is laughable to read the ASC's mission statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC's mission is to achieve maximum credibility of Australian corporations and securities markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the ASC could inform the Parliament why an expensive witch-hunt against one of the elected members has become part of its mission. I said earlier that I had spoken to the Victoria Police. However, having to resort to the protection of the law to this extent is something I find most disturbing. When Heidi is well enough to return to work, I intend reporting the incident at my factory to the Department of Labour in Victoria. I also intend asking the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Ms Fatin) to find out why two hefty standover men, supposedly representing a government department, were allowed to terrorise and harass not only my typist, Heidi, but a female employee at my accountant's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is another and even more disturbing aspect to this matter, which I believe explains much about the actions of the ASC. Last year, in my capacity as a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, along with Senator Cooney and Senator Campbell I submitted a dissenting report regarding the powers of the ASC. Since then I have been subjected to systematic and relentless harassment from several ASC bureaucrats in Melbourne on account of my actions as a member. I am forced to the conclusion that this is a witch-hunt aimed at influencing my conduct as a member of this Parliament. I contend that the actions of certain employees of the ASC constitute an attempt by improper means to influence me in my parliamentary conduct. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the form 2 which was delivered to my secretary. You will note that it has my name on it, which has been crossed out and my typist Heidi's name put on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance is about the shame children feel about the word `children' in Australian society. Let me explain. During the week 4 November to 11 November this year, 23 young people between the ages of 11 and 16 came from all over Australia to Canberra to participate in a conference titled `Partnership for the Future' organised by the President of Peaceways, Ms Ellen Brogren. One of the goals of this conference was that children have input into an Australian national plan of action. The second goal was to create a channel through which Australian children could have a voice in the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before coming to Canberra each child spoke with many other children about their concerns, priorities and suggested solutions for the future. The partnership participants also prepared for the conference by studying the Australian Children's Appeal, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the World Summit Declaration. During the week they learned much about themselves as children. In discussion about what to name the children's national council they all discovered they were ashamed to be associated with the word `children'. In Australian society, that word is looked down upon. They ended up saying they were going to change that attitude about the word `children'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That shame in using the word `children' is a sad indictment of Australian society. Children represent 25 per cent of the population but are the most undervalued, under-resourced, unrepresented minority in our nation. I was extremely proud that the children asked me, as the member for Port Adelaide, to introduce their two proposals for the establishment of a children's national council and for a ministry for children and youth affairs. What follows are the words of the children, and I thank Amanda Tamblin and Mia Handshin for taking the responsibility for organising the information and sending it to my office:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the children of Australia, ask that you attend our words carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want you to take them seriously and then, with your wisdom, life experience, expertise and knowledge, encourage us on our path.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want you to believe in our abilities and our commitment to making our future better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask you to point out the correct procedures so that in our enthusiasm to proceed we do not overlook important developmental steps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask you to be sincere in your efforts on our behalf, because with your confidence we will grow in confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask for two things to occur:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.That a Ministry for Children and Youth Affairs be created;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.That the concept of a Children's National Council become a reality with your approval and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's children will be tomorrow's adults, and with your help they will be independent, informed, committed and united, making this country and the world a better place.</PARA>
<PARA>The conference had two main goals: firstly, to have the ideas and concerns of children included in the adult Australian plan of action, and in the response to the World Summit for Children declaration&mdash;which promises a better life for children by the year 2000&mdash;and, secondly, to create a channel into the Commonwealth Government through which children can have an effective voice in the decisions that affect their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These aims were encapsulated in two documents entitled `Recommendations for Tomorrow' and `Target for Tomorrow'. Both of those documents were written by conference members and were presented in Parliament House by the participants. The `Recommendations for Tomorrow' document was the culmination of over 3,000 opinions on concerns, issues and possible solutions from Australian children. These opinions were collected by the conference participants, prior to them coming together and, as such, represented the thoughts of a very broad cross-section of Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference members hoped to have this document included as part of the means of implementing the World Summit for Children: Declaration for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. The document addressed all issues and topics which were suggested in the plan of action for implementing the declaration. Primarily, the document listed the concerns of Australia's children and youth, and sought to remind the interdepartmental committee&mdash;the group responsible for monitoring and implementing the declaration&mdash;that children comprise a quarter of Australia's population and that the implementation of such plans would have a direct bearing on their daily lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference participants spent much time discussing and formulating a proposal called `Target for Tomorrow' which embodies the plan for a children's national council. This council will become the link between the children and the Government. It will be the bridge across which each group could walk to unite their efforts and ideas to make that brighter future a reality. The council would provide a voice for the children, an avenue for input, and a focus where children could become respected and valued members of society. It is envisaged that the council would operate on four different levels&mdash;community, district, State and Federal. The council would operate on a nationwide basis, with each State and Territory incorporating a separate branch of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community level would operate utilising the basic idea of a complaints mechanism. The CNC members would aim their channel at each and every member of the community under the legal voting age of 18. They would particularly plan to focus on the disadvantaged, the homeless, and the disabled to give them a voice and to give them hope. The children's national council would operate on the basic premise that all children should have the right and the opportunity to voice issues of concern, and that these words would be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty in assessing information to disadvantaged groups has led to the plan to establish a network of communications. This would target youth shelters and other such residential care places within the general community. The children have created a logo, which they hope, in time, would become synonymous with the children's national council and readily identifiable as a voice for Australia's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obvious opportunities here for advertising, and that would serve to raise the profile of the community based operations of the children's national council. There would be children's national council representatives present in every school, youth group, refuge, and any other location where there is a regular gathering of children. At this level, the CNC representatives would be a direct channel from the children in their areas to the next step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives at the district level would be chosen from school and community groups. The district could be based on the electoral subdivisions, with several members representing each subdivision. They would deal with issues emanating from the community level. There would also be cooperation at local and municipal levels. It is envisaged that there would be considerable liaison with local members of parliament. This would further augment the communications network. For every subdivision, there would be a representative of the CNC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinct advantage of this is quite apparent; MPs would have first-hand knowledge of the concern of younger members of their constituencies. The State representatives would consist mainly of the partnership for the future participants. The aim of this level would be to deal with and oversee the complaints mechanism and the communication network, and to ensure that there is a highly visible State presence of children. They would deal with these issues by responding to suggestions, collating information from district representatives, researching and assessing the viability of possible solutions and reporting to the general CNC body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would assemble every six months in various parts of Australia. Part of the State agenda would include lobbying within the Government. This would mean presenting appropriate suggestions and concerns that children voice to State Government. It would also mean coordinating and encouraging delegates to put forward information to local councils. In short, they would be responsible for the implementation of the children's national council policy, and for maintaining open links and direct communication between the CNC and State governments. One of the most important tasks for this group will be to coordinate awareness programs and to ensure that information is readily available to all children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a Federal level the children's national council would meet annually in different capital cities, but more frequent meetings would be needs based. The group would discuss, collate, recommend action and report to issues put forward by the council members under the national report. The partnership for the future conference participants would comprise the majority of the original CNC body, and the CNC would work as partners with the Minister for children and youth, who would be requested to introduce CNC recommendations to the Parliament, keep CNC members informed about legislation affecting children's rights, and monitor all development concerning the World Summit for Children: Declaration for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. The children conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the C.N.C. is to become part of the consultative system, then power and the ability to make their decisions must be given to the children. The C.N.C. in its efforts to be independent, propose to handle their own funds . . . Official recognition as a national council would be imperative. Then the C.N.C. could be the representative of every child in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of the C.N.C. was created with this aim in mind&mdash;to create a permanent link with the Government, through which views and opinions could be transmitted, listened to and hopefully, acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The C.N.C. would represent one quarter of Australia's population&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a group currently under-resourced, undervalued and under-represented&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a group who have, at this time, no voice in the decisions which will affect their future. We simply ask to have a say, to be heard. We ask that you utilise this nation's finest resource, YOUR CHILDREN.</PARA>
<PARA>As one would expect, the aims of these young Australians are bold and enthusiastic, but they ask that the parliamentarians of this nation listen to them; that they be valued and allowed to participate in their own future. I commend to the House the general thrust of the issues they have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the so-called clever country. In the House earlier this morning I noticed that there was some discussion on the Australian $5 bill. The plastic $10 note issued by the Reserve Bank some time ago may have seemed clever but, behind the calm picture of Captain Cook, there is a veritable storm going on. The $10 note was based on technology developed by Dr Robert Lee of the CSIRO Division of Materials, Science and Technology. This technology is known as Catpix I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank of Australia purchased the rights to the Catpix I technology package from the CSIRO for around $9m. The inherent value of this property was that it allowed the development of forgery-proof bank notes and other such products. Subsequently, some weaknesses became evident in this Catpix I technology. There also seems to be some doubt whether the Reserve Bank actually lodged an application in time for a patent to protect its investment in this technology. Despite this, the Reserve Bank of Australia sold the Government of Singapore the right to use the technology on its $50 note. In doing this, it seems to me that the Reserve Bank misrepresented its ownership of the technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is only the beginning of the story. While this was going on, Dr Lee at the CSIRO continued his work, and by early 1990 he had succeeded in developing Catpix II technology. This time he had hit the jackpot. This latest Pixelgram technology would indeed meet the needs of the security printing industry. It cannot be forged. It is simply the world's best technology available for this purpose and it has been developed right here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This apparently created quite a dilemma for the Reserve Bank of Australia. When approached by the CSIRO with the perfected Catpix II technology, the Reserve Bank of Australia indicated that it was not interested. The Reserve Bank declined to become involved. In June 1990 a meeting apparently took place between Messrs Stocker and Lynch of the CSIRO, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Phillips, and the manager of the note printing branch of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Bob Larkin. At this meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia allegedly suggested to the CSIRO that it should suppress Catpix II so that it did not compete with the inferior and inadequate Catpix I technology which the Reserve Bank had purchased and ownership of which it had failed to safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having received this information from the Reserve Bank, the CSIRO went out into the marketplace to find a partner to enter a joint venture to commercialise the Catpix II technology. The CSIRO eventually entered into an arrangement with a Gold Coast-based company called Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd. Charter Pacific, in view of this arrangement which had been offered to it by the CSIRO, entered into a number of other arrangements on the basis of its understanding&mdash;a reasonable understanding in the circumstances&mdash;that the CSIRO was the owner of the Pixelgram. In January 1992, a dispute arose between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the CSIRO as to the ownership of the Catpix II technology. Apparently by this time the Reserve Bank realised how valuable this property was and that it had made a very serious mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this dispute are unfortunate: that is something of an understatement. While this dispute has gone on now for many months, there has been loss of income dollars to Australia from valuable technology developed in Australia. This is not the first time that something developed in this country has been lost overseas or not processed in time. We have lost money, we have lost job opportunities for Australians, and we have lost valuable time in the exploitation of a worldwide leading edge technology. We have seen financial hardship created for a small Australian public company and its directors, who have acted in good faith in attempting to play a role in making Australia the clever country. We have seen, perhaps more importantly than all of the previous points, what now amounts to worldwide ridicule of two of Australia's pre-eminent bodies, the CSIRO and the Reserve Bank of Australia, who are fighting over this. As an adjunct, we are seeing disillusionment in Australia&mdash;in fact, worldwide&mdash;with respect to Australia's ability to get its act together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charter Pacific entered into a number of arrangements to secure finance for the purchase of what is called an E beam writing machine. However, these arrangements have floundered because of the dispute. I believe, and I have given careful consideration to the facts placed before me by all the parties, that the Reserve Bank of Australia made a number of misrepresentations to Charter's business colleagues. Apparently, the Reserve Bank has held itself out as having a legal interest in Pixelgram. It indicated that the Reserve Bank and the CSIRO were in dispute over Pixelgram and that the Reserve Bank would, if necessary, restrain the CSIRO from commercially exploiting Pixelgram. Finally, it indicated&mdash;and we are talking here about dealings with potential partners of Charter Pacific&mdash;that the Reserve Bank wanted CSIRO to suppress Pixelgram so that it did not compete with Catpix I, which was the technology the RBA had actually purchased and which was shown subsequently to be defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally it is impossible for this small Gold Coast based company to proceed until the dispute is resolved. It has been forced to take legal action in the Federal Court against the Reserve Bank and the CSIRO under section 75B of the Trade Practices Act. Obviously, it is a David and Goliath struggle. No doubt the Reserve Bank of Australia and the CSIRO hoped Charter Pacific would give up and go away. But why should it? It believes that the CSIRO and the Reserve Bank of Australia have conspired to squeeze it out of the Pixelgram technology commercialisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does this leave the clever country? Frankly, not looking too clever at all. Here is technology calculated by the CSIRO to be worth half a billion dollars in export earnings for Australia. As Pierpont observed in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 8 September 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra&mdash;which is so good at preaching efficiency to Australian businessmen&mdash;has so far been unable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>perhaps I should intersperse there `unwilling'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to sort this . . . out.</PARA>
<PARA>It is better to let the taxpayer pay than for the Government to make decisions. Judge Lee, in the Federal Court, recently instructed the parties to negotiate to resolve their differences. I hope that when they appear again in the Federal Court in Brisbane tomorrow there will have been some progress&mdash;I hope that there has been progress in this matter, for Australia's sake. If we are to become the clever country, surely it is up to the Government to set a good example. Here we have two government instrumentalities fighting over something and acting against the interests of a private Australian company&mdash;one of my constituent companies&mdash;to prevent them from getting on with the job that they reckon they are entitled to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I have placed on notice on this subject 13 questions of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). I look forward to his answers but, more importantly, I hope that either he or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), both of whom are fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this case, will intervene to resolve the problem before it goes any further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the State of Victoria. In particular, I grieve for the way in which the Victorian Government has embarked upon a policy of exclusion in the methods by which it has been implementing many of the changes that it has decided to carry out. I am not going to enter into the debate about what needs to be done in Victoria. That is a legitimate debate. It is a debate that should occur and it is a debate that is recognised by many Victorians, including, might I say, the present State Opposition. But, clearly, the methodology that is being used by the Victorian Government is causing a great deal of fear and concern. It was interesting to note the comments made in the Anglican newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Church Scene</EMPHASIS> which described Mr Kennett's approach as being ham-fisted. It went on to say that Mr Kennett's form of government had polarised the State instead of encouraging constructive thought. It is encouraging, constructive thought that is required. My concern is with the Kennett Government's total disregard for institutions such as local government and parliament itself. I am also concerned at its refusal to consult with the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Victoria, a lot has been said about mandates. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines mandate as an instruction or permission from the electorate for a certain policy. The inescapable conclusion is that the electorate will know what the certain policy is. Under this definition, it cannot be reasonably argued that Mr Kennett has a mandate for the social and industrial carnage that he has brought on Victoria. Which of the policies can he claim a mandate for? I do not recall that during the election campaign there was any mention of a Thatcher style poll tax&mdash;a pernicious rate levy that takes no account of a person's capacity or ability to pay. I do remember that Mr Kennett told voters that no worker would be worse off under his industrial relations policies; even he acknowledges that that is not the case. How then can the Victorian Government talk of a mandate for its policies? It has no mandate. It simply has the numbers. The way in which it has put the changes through the short parliamentary session indicates the contempt that it has for the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill after Bill was forced through the Parliament without proper debate. Of the 38 Bills introduced in a three-week session, 25 were declared urgent and put through the processes with less than two hours of debate. These were not just small pieces of legislation, they were major pieces of legislation that went to the heart of a number of fundamental rights. For instance, it included industrial relations legislation where people's fundamental industrial rights and conditions were eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contempt for the democratic process was not only evident in the introduction of draconian nineteenth century industrial relations policies, but it was also evident in the way that the Government treated local government. In relation to the poll tax, councils have been told, and I repeat, told, `Here is this new tax and you collect it'. There was no consultation, there was just a piece of legislation that ensured that the State's position was tightly protected at the expense of council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The piece of legislation meant that, in any case where an individual decides to protest by not paying the so-called levy, it is the council that has to bear the cost. The legislation is framed in such a way that the first $100 of any moneys received by the council is deducted for the levy and not for the rate collections that the municipalities are collecting for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of school closures have been announced and have been well and truly implemented, again, without any consultation before or since. As I said in the Appropriation debate last month, there was no recognition in these decisions of the impact on students' educational opportunities, and no recognition of the impact that the closure of these schools would have on the resources of surrounding schools, surrounding schools that all suffered reductions in staffing numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there was no recognition of the wider community use that has been made of school facilities. There was no thought given to compensation for these groups. With the one month's notice that was given, these groups were left with few options. For instance, at Keon Park Secondary College there is a wide-ranging list of community groups which use its facilities. It is used by Italian pensioners' bocce club, by self-defence karate groups, by various dance groups, and by local basketball and cricket clubs. At no time was there any recognition given of the use that the wider community has made of the facilities that are at the school and are being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announcement of the closure, the school council, on behalf of the wider school community, has been endeavouring to meet with the Victorian Minister to discuss for the first time the future of the school. It is a vain but valiant attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, on behalf of the school council, Mrs Yvonne Arnall had a number of things to say about the decision. She indicated that the school has recently undergone a facelift where $1m was used to upgrade the facilities. One of the reasons why certain schools have been earmarked for closure is that certain schools need funds that are not available for their upgrading. At Keon Park, Mrs Arnall would contend that that is not the case. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a school that is more than up to standard, even by Mr Hayward's measure, and one that offered the second-best VCE in the State jointly with Merrilands Secondary College (38 out of the 44 units) with a success rate of 92 per cent, we are hard-pressed to understand why we are to be closed.</PARA>
<PARA>She indicated that there would be the need for 10 well-equipped and well-maintained technology studies rooms to be transferred to only one woodwork room at Merrilands Secondary College. Mrs Arnall posed this question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this Government thinking of?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the type of "economical" measure this recession-stricken state needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government hasn't done the homework and that's why it won't enter into discussions with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We don't fulfil any of Mr Hayward's criteria for closure. His decision makes no economic, educational or excusable sense!</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I am told that the school was granted a delegation yesterday, not with the Minister, but with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Stephen Elder. Less than 24 hours after that deputation, while this debate is being conducted in this chamber, workers are demolishing Keon Park Secondary College, a school that less than five weeks ago could have contemplated going into 1993 as a continuing secondary college in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an act of sheer vandalism and political vengeance. Jeff Kennett has no mandate to implement policies of this sort. It is no accident that the present&mdash;but for how long?&mdash;beleaguered leader of Her Majesty's Federal Opposition has now belatedly decided that he should feign a preference for listening to people. Australians outside Victoria have been given a window into the future. They can recall what coalition governments are all about: they are governments that seek to entrench privilege; that govern on behalf of part of the community; and that act without consultation. This is the politics of exclusion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent years, I have on a number of occasions raised serious matters concerning allegations of maladministration within the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training. At the present time, I have many questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> relating to possible impropriety in the running of the Department, none of which has yet been answered by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), and some of which have been there since last May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore with interest that I note that the Secretary to the Department, Mr G.F. Taylor, in a minute of 29 October this year, has notified departmental staff of the establishment of a fraud prevention unit within DEET. The minute of Mr Taylor reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In DEET, we rightly pride ourselves on our commitment and service to clients, on our ability to deliver important economic and social policies and programs, and on the gains that we have achieved across the labour market and our education and training systems.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the minute says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our record is sullied by a small minority amongst us who defraud the system, or who do not care, who deliberately avoid systems standards and security controls, who condone slack internal monitoring or who otherwise refuse to recognise their responsibilities. There is no room in DEET for these practices, or for the people involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently criminal charges have been laid against some officers of the department. Other investigations are currently under way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have now established within DEET a fraud prevention unit (FPU), which will be headed by Mr. Andre Kaspura, and which will operate in every state.</PARA>
<PARA>The minute later states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be pursuing all cases of fraud with the full force of the Public Service Act, and, as appropriate, the courts. We will likewise be pursuing all future cases of irregular or circumvented procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>This is all very commendable&mdash;although the fraud prevention unit is being established for some rather disconcerting reasons&mdash;and, no doubt, the Minister and the Secretary are feeling very pleased about the initiative taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the initiative looks a little less enlightened, when one looks at the senior executive officer appointed to head the outposted fraud prevention unit in Victoria. Mr Barry Hogan was appointed by transfer on 7 December last, strangely at about the same time as the very vacancy to which he was appointed was advertised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. Mr Hogan was previously manager of the overseas student section in Victoria, and was classified as an excess officer when the OSS moved to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his capacity as head of the OSS, Mr Hogan kept personal records on three members of his staff, without their authority. One of these members, a Mr Joseph Chetcuti, sought his `secret file' under the Freedom of Information Act. This lead to Mr Hogan denying, in a minute of 15 February 1991, the existence of any such documents. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chetcuti's statement that I kept a `secret file' on him is both offensive and untrue. I do not keep `secret files' on Mr Chetcuti or any other member of my staff.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that Mr Hogan was later forced to retract this statement in an affidavit before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition, Mr Hogan misled the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in an article, by Mr John Masanauskas of 30 October 1990, entitled `Truant students breached their visa'. In the article, Mr Hogan was quoted as saying that there was no evidence of malpractice in the eight institutions examined by DEET at that point that took overseas students. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 200 overseas students this year had been identified as having unsatisfactory class attendance and were liable for detention.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Department was already examining malpractice, such as the `apparent lack of reporting' by the Academy of English. Moreover, one of two departmental teams alone had 375 terminations of students' status at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter of 3 July 1991 from Ms Margaret Flynn, Executive Officer, Personnel Management, to the State Director, Mr J.D. Davidson, also clearly shows that Mr Hogan did not honestly deal with a freedom of information request from Mr Masanauskas concerning malpractice involving overseas students and did not properly identify all relevant documents held about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another incident, a staff member reported abuses to the Medical Board of Victoria by a doctor who was issuing certificates for non-attendance for Chinese students. This officer, for his trouble, was victimised by Mr Hogan. A subsequent inquiry found on 31 March 1992 that the doctor, Dr Woi Chong Chen, had acted unprofessionally. Incredibly, Mr Hogan set out to prevent the officer from appearing before the Medical Board of Victoria to which the officer provided important evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This extraordinary litany of events involving Mr Hogan continues further. On 28 May 1991, Mr Hogan advised the DEET State Director in Victoria, in writing, to write off overseas student charge debts of a very substantial nature. The minute pertaining to this reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should point out in each case the amount outstanding is in fact a charge imposed on overseas students studying in Australia, i.e., the moneys have not been paid to the student by the Commonwealth as for other study allowance schemes. The charge is levied on the student for each year of study undertaken in Australia. The charge varies depending on the course and the year of study undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hogan then concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your signature at the top of each of the 10 schedules is sufficient to approve all cases on the schedules, i.e., 218 cases totalling $703,366.39.</PARA>
<PARA>This write-off of debts by the State Director was unlawful, due to the wrong advice given by Mr Hogan when he was fully aware of his responsibilities in this regard. The purpose in so doing&mdash;this is the real significance of the matter&mdash;was to avoid reporting to central office where write-offs should have occurred. Furthermore, on this same matter of debt write-off, a $6,471 debt, owed by Ms N.N. Liu for 1989, was incorrectly shown on the write-off as two separate debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hogan also allowed two senior DEET staff members, Ms Frances Ewe and Mr Stephen Fitzpatrick, to seriously abuse overtime arrangements at a time when the overseas student program was being wound up and, in fact, many Chinese students had stopped studying. The overtime sheets for February, March and April of 1991 amply show the extensive scope of the abuse. Mr Hogan, incidentally, had previously worked hard to ensure Frances Ewe was transferred from Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that a grievance by a staff member who had reported abuses and had been denied the opportunity to act on higher duties was subsequently upheld against Mr Hogan. One other small matter about Mr Hogan is worth putting on the record. In December 1990, Mr Hogan sought a cash advance of $500 for an end-of-year overseas students office function. The State Director considered this amount excessive and reduced it to $100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On any measure, Mr Hogan appears to have had a most peculiar record, but over recent years it is dotted with the most disturbing incidents. Such a record would be most unsatisfactory for any public servant at any level, but for the senior executive officer in charge of the outposted fraud prevention unit in Victoria, it is, to say the least, somewhat alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect, I would suggest to the Minister and the Secretary that, if their well-intentioned fraud prevention arrangements in DEET&mdash;and I do not dispute the need for them&mdash;are not to fail, they need to again look closely at the appointment of Mr Hogan to this particular post. In substantiation of the points I have made throughout this grievance speech, I seek leave to table a number of very relevant documents on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to express my feelings about the progress of funding for the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway, as all honourable members will be aware, is a major road between Sydney and Brisbane. It is a road that carries an enormous amount of traffic. The Pacific Highway has received a great deal of publicity in the last three or four years, and quite rightly so, as a number of very tragic accidents, involving a large number of lives, have occurred on the highway. Those types of things seem to attract a large amount of publicity and it is for that reason that I feel I have to raise the matter of funding for the Pacific Highway with the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can vividly recall that during the last two election campaigns the issue of funding for the Pacific Highway was very much to the fore in the minds of coalition members and members of the Labor Government. With the assistance of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), my colleague the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and I did a great deal of the legwork to ensure that Federal funds did come across for the Pacific Highway. It is not directly a Federal Government responsibility. The New England Highway was reallocated as the national highway some years ago under very spurious circumstances, I feel. The Pacific Highway is not a Federal Government responsibility but because of the nature of the road, and because of the traffic that it carries, the Federal Government has seen fit to put funds into this particular road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government, with the full agreement and cooperation of the State Government, has come to a creditable funding arrangement. It is to be put in place over a number of years. With that signed agreement between the State Government and the Federal Government, real progress was being made on upgrading the Pacific Highway. At this stage, it is a two-lane highway very much following the old route down towards the ferries that went across some of those marvellous rivers. Some honourable members may recall that. I do not recall going across the ferries, but I know that it was not so long ago that they were taken out and replaced with bridges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highway runs along a very picturesque section of the east coast. It carries a lot of tourist traffic, heavy freight traffic and buses. In the past 20 or 30 years the traffic on that road has increased enormously, and that has led to a much larger number of accidents. When it comes down to the cold hard facts those are the tragedies that occur as the volume of traffic increases. The number of calls to ambulance stations, police stations and other areas increases as well. The insurance companies would know all about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding agreement with the State Government put in place in the last 18 months to two years has been breached in a most insincere way, and without any consultation with the Federal Government. The Minister knows the highway well from undertaking a tour some time ago from Hexham right up to Brisbane&mdash;I think it was in July 1990. He certainly learnt a lot and took on board some of the concerns of the local governments, the Government and the Opposition with regard to  the improvements that need to be made, some of which, unfortunately, have been put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement in February the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that some funds from that area and two particular projects were to be brought forward. I am talking about the bypass at Brunswick Heads, a small town in my electorate, and also a deviation around Raleigh. The one at Raleigh was particularly vital because it was bypassing a very serious black spot region. The one at Brunswick Heads is a similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the cost-benefit ratio on the one at Brunswick Heads was astronomical, in terms of spending a few million dollars on a bypass. The flow-on effect in the town was something like six or seven times any of the other cost-benefit ratios of any of the other projects that were on the board at that time. The other benefit to Brunswick Heads was the safety aspect, because the Pacific Highway, at this stage, actually divides the town in two, so that residents on the western side of the present highway have a great deal of difficulty getting across to the east towards the amenities, not to mention the recreational amenities of the river and the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tour that the Minister undertook revealed a number of things, including black spots. All were very quickly attended to by the Minister, and I compliment him, the Government and the Cabinet for being able to put those funds forward to assist in the Pacific Highway upgrading. There is no doubt that the movement towards a dual carriageway was progressing at a steady rate, but it was through a funding agreement with the State Government that it was going to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grievance that I have is that, while that funding agreement may be still in place, a number of the projects which the Federal Government saw fit to bring forward, namely, the Brunswick Heads bypass and the Raleigh deviation, have all been put on hold, and they have been put on hold for the simple reason that the State Minister, Mr Wal Murray, the Minister for Roads in that State, has come up with this particular notion from somewhere that there needs to be a tollway along that section of the coast as the only way to actually get an upgraded and increased standard of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Murray did not consult at all with the Federal Government on this, despite the fact that we had a funding agreement to upgrade the road over a number of years and to see that some of the more notorious sections of that road were improved. At the whim of Mr Murray that was all thrown out, and, also at the whim of the State Government, that agreement was put in jeopardy and put on hold until they come up with some other package or gimmick somewhere down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What particularly concerns me is that at the last two Federal elections, at least, the coalition candidates on the coast have made a great deal of running out of the amount of Federal funds which have gone into the highway. They have gone strangely silent in the last few months, and I challenge them to put back on the record the funding of the Pacific Highway and make it an election issue as they did in 1987 and 1990. I challenge them to make an election issue of the funding of the Pacific Highway and of the coalition's role in that aspect of a very needed public infrastructure which appears to have gone by the board. I compliment the Minister, because I know he was as disgusted as I was when he heard the news but also because he has agreed that the funds will not be diverted anywhere else but will be kept on hold until the State Government comes to its senses and these particular projects can go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the degree of political running that was made out of the Pacific Highway in 1987 and 1990, particularly by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). I would not mind hearing a little more from him now on how he feels about the State Government, his colleagues in the Liberal-National Party coalition, pulling the plug on these particular projects. I wish that he would lend his weight to the argument that the projects have to go ahead. After all, he did make a great deal of running on the issue of the Pacific Highway funding in 1990 and through 1991. I will join him in lending weight to the arguments to go to the State Government to ensure that it gives these projects the go-ahead that they deserve. After all he agreed with me that both the Raleigh deviation and the Brunswick Heads bypass are very necessary, mainly on safety issues, not to mention the cost-benefit ratios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have the chance, I also pay a compliment to the honourable member for Page and the Minister for Land Transport for their work in getting an upgrading of a road known as the Summerland Way, which is not in my electorate but has an impact on my electorate in terms of the funnelling-in of traffic. That road is also a tourist road and it will be upgraded in conjunction with the Kyogle-Murwillumbah road, into which the Federal Government has been able to put $1m for very necessary upgrading of local infrastructure. This will have benefits for the area of Uki, Kyogle and Nimbin in my electorate for many years to come. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am probably making my last address in this House in the thirty-sixth Parliament. In the seven parliaments in which I have represented the division of Dawson in this place, I have certainly been one who has been very interested in the mainstay of that electorate, the sugar industry. Before I discuss what I believe are the problems of that industry, I would like to pay a tribute to those farmers, the workers on those farms, the families of those farmers, the people who are the millers, the management and the mill workers, and the researchers and scientists, the marketers and the people who run the services and associated businesses, which have a part to play within the sugar industry because they have maintained it. The number of people who derive a living directly or indirectly from it must be in the hundreds of thousands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Federation, sugar has been the stabilising economic and social influence of Queensland, particularly along the coast from the border to Mossman. At this particular time the price of sugar is diminishing further. This week the price of sugar has dropped to US8.4c a pound. Five years ago I can recall that in a Senate committee representations were made that suggested that the break-even price for the sugar industry to survive was 10c. So at the moment we are 1.6c a pound less than what was then the break-even point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the costs that are now associated with the sugar industry and probably with all industries. I was interested in a figure that was given recently that suggests that 21 per cent of all business costs in Australia are State, Federal or local government charges. The sugar industry bears a large proportion of those costs; perhaps not 21 per cent but very close to it. I also acknowledge that in today's climate the sugar industry, particularly in Queensland, has a very close association with the AWU and has recently struck an agreement to have one-union representation in the industry within the farming sector. I believe there are concessions bound into that agreement. But even this season the threat of compulsory unionism saw some farmers' cane being almost black banned, which again adds to the costs of the industry. So, while there is a favourable labour market, it could be improved a lot to relieve the costs on farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The types of government charges that we have seen in the last few years have been such things as the fringe benefits tax and the superannuation guarantee levy, and substantial road user, electricity and water charges have been introduced by the Queensland Government. I will give an example of the substantial road user charge. Five years ago I renewed my drivers licence at $10; just recently I renewed it at the price of $47. That is a 470 per cent increase in that road user charge. These types of charges are affecting not only me but the whole industry. As I mentioned before, there is also the diminishing world price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back in the history of the sugar industry, it was recognised at Federation back in 1901 that a condition of Queensland's entry was an embargo on sugar. This remained until 1988 and in the last three years sugar has suffered a halving of the tariff which was then introduced from $115 a tonne to the current amount of $55 a tonne. In that three-year period further deregulation has taken place right across the industry to make it more efficient than it was. Yet the usual inefficiencies that are associated with tariffs and the protection of an industry are not evident in the sugar trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry has coped with the loss of the favoured Great Britain-Commonwealth trade of the 1960s. It has also coped with the diminution of trade to the United States sector in the 1980s. Mechanisation was introduced throughout the industry. New products were introduced. Value was added. Bulk loading at the ports was introduced. Research and experimentation have basically been undertaken for the benefit of the industry. Throughout the world, the sugar industry in Queensland, Australia, is regarded as the most efficient producer. I am distressed by what has happened in the last decade or so, and by what is continuing to happen to an industry which is the mainstay not only of the economy but also the social fabric of the Queensland coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weather is another factor. Over the last three years we have had unusual drought patterns. I have been to farms and at shed meetings where people have said that family inheritances from three generations have been spent just on surviving. I have seen situations which are absolutely appalling, with women and children taking the place of men who have been discharged from the farm because the farmers could not afford to pay them to work on the farm, while people who are unemployed sit vacantly on the sideline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen crops missed for two seasons. That loss amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In that time, I have seen the income support from RAS become almost non-existent as RAS and DSS fight about where income security should be. In that time, fewer drought provisions have been provided. In fact, the last major water resources supplied in Queensland were the Burdekin Dam, which was the initiative of our last Federal coalition Government, and the Proserpine Dam, which was the initiative of the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report, which was issued earlier this year, was flawed badly in one area. While the report itself recognised the need for micro-economic reform, it then proceeded to recommend that tariffs should be zeroed by the year 1996-97, irrespective of the fact that those reforms had not taken place. The real problem is that in Canberra the economists who prepared that report and made those recommendations were not prepared to look at the major costs that are instrumental in farmers' costs&mdash;that 21 per cent against business which I mentioned&mdash;and they do nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Commission was prepared, within that report, to recommend the loss of that tariff within that time with no labour market reform, no transport reform, no waterfront reform, and no tax reform, while maintaining government penalties, but taking away the benefits. The necessity of waterfront and transport reform is borne out by the fact that we can import sugar from Thailand at the same price, so far as shipping is concerned, as the coastal trade shipment from one port to another. None of those reform measures was obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe there is an argument for tariffs on sugar, which separates the sugar industry from other industries. The main one is the corrupted market that Australian industry must compete against, particularly in the European Community, the United States of America and Thailand. At today's price of US8.4c a pound, with the exchange rate of US68.5c for our dollar, these are basically the types of subsidies we are facing across the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $55 tariff is the benefit Australia receives for its domestic price over the world price. Thailand has a $277 per tonne subsidy, which is 147 per cent above world price; the European Community has a $716 subsidy, or 258 per cent above world price; and the US has a $451 subsidy at 162 per cent above world price. They are the types of subsidies we have to compete with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of what people might say, the influence of those subsidies on Australia is severe because while Thailand receives a subsidy of 35 per cent on its domestic production, and the rest is export, Australia produces 20 per cent for domestic consumption and 80 per cent for the world trade. That means that the effective subsidy available for domestic production is not as available for Australia as it is for those other countries. I believe that this means a need for some retention of a subsidy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members might recall that last month I sought to bring the House up to date with the movements of the former Brisbane Lord Mayor, and now Federal parliamentary aspirant, Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson. The overwhelming requests that I have received for more information on that matter have encouraged me to return to this subject and discuss it at greater length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that Mrs Atkinson was the high profile Lord Mayor of the city of Brisbane who was defeated at the last Council election. Her defeat came as somewhat of a surprise, given her extremely high profile, but the conventional wisdom explaining why she was defeated was that she was perceived increasingly as being slightly arrogant, out of touch, and enjoying a lifestyle which was somewhat out of step with the lifestyles of a lot of voters who may have been experiencing some difficulties and some uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, Mrs Atkinson was defeated and became much humbler&mdash;understandably so&mdash;by the experience. Obviously, anyone would do so as a result. Nonetheless, there was an enormous amount of speculation as to where Mrs Atkinson's path would lead her. To put people's minds at rest, she decided to hire a room at the Brisbane Sheraton Hotel and conduct press interviews to announce what her intentions would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took a fair bit of interest in this at the time because it had been widely speculated in the newspapers by pundits in the know that she was likely to become the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Dickson, a seat which was created in the Federal redistribution. Since I was nominating for the Labor Party for Dickson, it was of some interest to me in this regard. However, my mind was put at rest because as a result of these interviews it was announced, as in that famous line of a former American Vice-President, `You won't have Nixon to kick around any more', that we would not have Sallyanne to kick around any more and that public life would have to survive without her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lo and behold, some 18 months later, and in a Nixon-like recovery, Mrs Atkinson reappeared as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Rankin. People would be surprised that in emerging from this sort of chrysalis Mrs Atkinson was not reborn as a beautiful butterfly, as happens in most metamorphoses, but rather came out as something rather more dowdy. In fact, her first public appearance was in the suburb of Inala, in the city of Brisbane, dressed in a tracksuit. Honourable members might be somewhat surprised because she had been rather well known for her sartorial elegance and was dubbed `Salaryanne' and other unkind terms. It was rather strange that she would appear in a tracksuit. </PARA>

I mentioned last week the statements at the Boonah golf club where she was musing about the seating hierarchies in aeroplanes and saying, `Isn't it strange how trade union officials are always up the front while ordinary people like us are always down the back?'. Of course, in some 37 domestic and 15 international trips she undertook as Lord Mayor, never once did she grace the back of an airline. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses its profound sympathy on behalf of all Australians for the suffering being endured by the people of Somalia as a result of famine, clan warfare and banditry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)commends the efforts being made by those organisations and individuals who are working to relieve that suffering;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)expresses its full confidence in, and support for, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are being deployed to Somalia and looks forward to their safe return.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask that the House focus today on the terrible human tragedy in Somalia and the international efforts currently being undertaken to alleviate the suffering there. Since the end of the dictatorial rule of ex-President Mahamed Siad Barre in January 1991, the political and economic institutions in Somalia have disintegrated. Fighting between shifting factional coalitions has compounded the effects of years of economic mismanagement and drought, and led to starvation and political anarchy on a massive scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Famine and clan warfare have so far taken the lives of an estimated quarter of a million Somalis. About two million people, or a third of Somalia's pre-war population, are still at risk of starvation. In this appalling situation, Australian and other international non-government organisations have shown great courage and compassion, struggling against frightening odds to get food and medicine to the suffering people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public has also responded generously, donating an estimated $11m to the relief effort in Somalia. The Australian Government has added $8.5m in humanitarian aid during this calendar year. Over the last weekend the Australian public donated another $600,000 to an appeal conducted on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio National</EMPHASIS> for Somalia and other drought and famine-stricken countries in Africa. I should like to congratulate the Australian aid workers with non-government organisations such as CARE Australia and World Vision on their efforts to bring relief to Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world has been slow to realise the need for decisive and concerted action by foreign governments in response to the human crisis in Somalia. A response was attempted in April this year when the United Nations Security Council&mdash;through resolution 751&mdash;established a peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM, to maintain a cease-fire, to promote a political settlement and to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. But UNOSOM was slow to get under way and was not structured adequately to deal with the problems it faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world was appalled to see Somalis continuing to starve while food donated by the international community was plundered by armed gangs or remained in warehouses because safe passage could not be guaranteed. Violence and extortion continued unabated and those UN troops who did arrive in Somalia found themselves confronted by lack of cooperation and hamstrung by their restrictive rules of engagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was against this bleak background that President Bush made his ground-breaking offer to provide substantial US troops to a new international coalition of forces that would enforce peace in Somalia, not simply try to keep it. The world community, and specifically the United Nations Security Council, welcomed the President's offer and sanctioned Operation Restore Hope through resolution 794 on 3 December. Member states were invited by the United Nations to contribute to a multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the beginning of the US led Operation Restore Hope the security situation has begun to improve in Somalia. Mogadishu has been secured and an agreement reached between the faction leaders on an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of their militias from the town. We should, however, remain cautious about undertakings given by the faction leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware of reports overnight that American and French forces have now safely entered the inland town of Baidoa. Feuding and banditry continue in other parts of the country. Lawlessness has increased lately as attempts are made to secure territory before the arrival of coalition troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided&mdash;in response to resolution 794 and at the invitation also of the United States&mdash;to make a large scale commitment of Australian forces to Operation Restore Hope. The operation is intended to create a secure environment for the provision of humanitarian relief in Somalia. We will join at least 20 other nations which have offered to be part of it. </PARA>

The United Nations has never before sanctioned intervention on such a scale in the internal affairs of a member state for humanitarian purposes.

Our contingent will total about 900 personnel, including four rifle companies from 1st Battalion, a reduced squadron of about 30 armoured personnel carriers, and logistic and engineer support elements. A battalion group is the minimum size unit that can fully support and protect itself and can readily integrate with coalition forces. </PARA>

The estimated additional cost of sending a battalion group to Operation Restore Hope for this period will be $19.5m.

The temporary absence of one of the battalions of the Operation Deployment Force is manageable, given our currently benign security environment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent history of Somalia is one of unparalleled tragedy. The country has been scarred by a civil war brought on as a result of the collapse of a repressive political system and the use of terror by so-called `warlords' intent on  personal power. More than a quarter of a million Somalis have already died from the combined effects of war and drought. Another two million of Somalia's six million people are threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the United Nations Secretary-General, more than 4.5 million people are in desperate need of food and other humanitarian assistance. It is a mark of the Somali tragedy that more than 280,000 refugees from that country have crossed over the Somali-Kenya border and more than 2,000 people arrive at refugee camps in Kenya every week. Even neighbouring Ethiopia and Djibouti&mdash;which are themselves afflicted by severe drought&mdash;have offered safe haven to Somalis fleeing the civil war and looking for food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within Somalia, reports indicate that there has been a total breakdown of law and order and of civil society. The United Nations reports that the famine has been made much worse by the absence of an effective civil infrastructure to distribute food. There is no national administration, no reliable power or communications, no semblance of a nationally imposed rule of law, and no access to medical or other facilities. For example, of the 15 hospitals which remained at least partially operational in August 1992, most have no water, electricity or drugs. The sanitary situation is deteriorating at an alarming rate and primary health care is practically non-existent. Disease is exacerbated by malnutrition and hunger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems caused by the decay of the national infrastructure have added to, and been made worse by, the large scale failure of the cereal harvest this year&mdash;a failure brought on by the lack of rain, the absence of security and the collapse of a market system to distribute what food was produced. Looked at from Australia, the situation in Somalia is a story of human misery that denies the most basic decency and rights to fellow human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in addition to the depressing problems I have already referred to, Somalia's gravest problem, and the one which makes the famine much worse, is the problem of random violence&mdash;violence perpetrated by the well-armed gangs of youths, barely, or not at all, under the control of the warlords, who have partitioned the country since the toppling of President Barre in January 1991. These gangs&mdash;the so-called `technicals' who roam the streets of Mogadishu and other provincial centres&mdash;have prevented the efficient distribution of relief supplies by overrunning distribution points and by looting supplies directly from docked ships and aircraft at airstrips and airports. One observer recently described the situation of anarchy prevailing in Somalia as `so complete as to be unique in modern history'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appalling situation which has developed through the exercise of random and uncontrolled violence has caused the country to degenerate to the point where no one authority has the power to bring a resolution to the dispute. The warlords have practically no control outside their well-armed compounds, leaving their forces free to conduct acts of banditry against the Somali people and aid workers. Stories have been recounted of the hijacking of food relief supplies, not only by armed gangs but also by villagers to whom the food was originally destined. They had no choice but to forcefully appropriate food supplies before gangs intervened to steal whatever they could to sell on the black market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation clearly requires some form of concerted international action to bring peace and stability to Somalia. Through Operation Restore Hope, the United Nations is now responding to that challenge. It is a substantial military operation designed to secure the peace in Somalia so that a successful food and medical relief operation will be able to operate throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the coalition parties gave their full support to Australia's involvement in the UN-mandated force which overturned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. At the time of the Australian decision to commit forces to the Gulf, I told the House that we had reached a turning point in history in which the future role of the United Nations would be determined. I said that the Gulf war presented a challenge to the international community of sovereign states which could not be allowed to go without a direct and, if need be, forceful response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Operation Restore Hope in Somalia represents a new stage in the post-Cold War evolution of global security. It constitutes a commitment by the United Nations not to accept the barbaric and wholesale mistreatment of people, even within national boundaries. It is to the credit of the United Nations that such a timely response has been instituted to the Somali crisis. And it is to the credit of the United States and other nations, including of course Australia, that they have contributed forces so readily to this humanitarian mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like here to pay tribute to the highly professional and dedicated men and women of the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, who have been called on, once again, to make a major contribution at very short notice to Operation Restore Hope. I have nothing but admiration for the professionalism of the ADF and its capacity to carry out highly difficult tasks under dangerous, indeed life-threatening, conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this moment, troops of the Australian Defence Force are making essential contributions to peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and Western Sahara. Our forces are making smaller contributions to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation operating in Jerusalem and the United Nations Mine Clearance Training Team which works in Pakistan, training Afghan personnel in mine clearance techniques. These operations collectively mean that Australia is making its largest ever contribution to international peacekeeping operations. The decision to deploy the First Battalion of the Operational Deployment Force more than doubles this existing commitment of forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has offered its support for Australian participation in all of these operations, and we will continue to support any such contributions in the future, provided that they answer a humanitarian need or represent a direct security interest. In the case of the Somalia contribution, Australia has a very clear humanitarian obligation to provide assistance in helping to restore some semblance of normality and human decency to that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to offer my support and commendation to Australia's non-government aid agencies which have been working in Somalia already for some time. These include a number of Australians working for CARE Australia who have very much been in the front line of dealing with the warring gangs in Mogadishu and Baidoa. But the state of anarchy in Somalia was such that the United Nations humanitarian mission could not effectively go ahead until a broader attempt was made to bring peace to the country. Thus the need arose for Operation Restore Hope&mdash;and the need has been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken at some length about the situation in Somalia and outlined the enormous task which is before the Allied forces constituted from approximately 30 countries to bring order and stability to Somalia. The coalition parties are strong supporters of Operation Restore Hope and even stronger supporters of the highly capable Australian battalion, which has been committed to the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also take this opportunity to refer briefly to some concerns about the precise operations in which our forces will be involved. Our first concern, of course, relates to the potential range of threats which the Allied forces will face. I note the comments on Tuesday by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) that the threat ranges from medium to high if the force is not engaged in disarming the Somali warring gangs, and high to very high if the forces disarm the gangs. The seriousness of this situation in which our forces will operate cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peacekeeping forces are quite likely to face significant dangers. The Government has clearly considered this matter carefully in its decision to send an integrated battalion group to the operation. We hope that we will be kept fully informed by the Government about the security situation in which our forces will be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement today indicated that our troops in Somalia will have the right of self-defence and will be armed with their normal complement of infantry arms and weapons. We welcome that announcement. In situations of danger, such as will face our troops in Somalia, this requirement is fundamentally important and should not be compromised. Recently, in Morocco, there was an unfortunate incident where our Defence Force peacekeeping personnel had their arms confiscated by local authorities. That was a most regrettable precedent which I trust will not be repeated in situations where our forces are in some possible danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second concern relates to the functions which the Australian battalion will be called upon to perform. I understand that discussions are under way in the United Nations to determine precisely the role of the peacekeeping force, particularly as it relates to the disarming function. Again, I trust that the Prime Minister will keep the Opposition, the Parliament and the public informed about whatever decision is made on operational roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, we would appreciate some further information from the Government concerning the arrangements for the funding of this deployment. The Prime Minister announced in his statement today that the cost would be $19.5m. We would appreciate some indication as to whether this amount will come from a one-off supplement to the defence budget or whether it will be funded from savings in other areas of defence. In  particular, we would appreciate some assurance from the Government that the training exercises of Defence Force personnel in Australia will not be compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has some concerns about the proposed duration of the Australian deployment. I note that the Government maintains that 17 weeks is the maximum time we will be able to spare the battalion from local duty in Australia. Of course, this raises questions about the possible impact on the wider peacekeeping operation if the Australian force is compelled to withdraw at this time without regard to the actual progress of the operation 17 weeks from now. This is an important issue which I trust the Government will address during the time of the battalion's deployment. Again, I hope the Opposition will be kept informed of developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Opposition believes that this is a very important deployment fully deserving of the size of the military contribution about to be made by the Australian Defence Force. We have the highest regard for the capacity of the battalion to carry out this task. I am very pleased to join with the Prime Minister, and I hope all members of the House, in wishing the battalion well and a safe return to their families and loved ones. </PARA>

Outside the capital, some things are even worse; famine is already striking nomads in central Somalia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unusual that for the third time in the life of one parliamentary term the Australian Parliament is, by this motion, authorising a major commitment overseas. Firstly, there was the Gulf war commitment; secondly, the Cambodian peacekeeping force commitment; and, now, the Somalian contingent, which primarily involves my old battalion, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. In addition, there were commitments to the Western Sahara, the Middle East and Pakistan. Our best wishes are extended at this time, at Christmas, to all Australian forces involved with all of those commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the Gulf commitment was testimony to the professionalism of the Allied forces. The Australian part of that Gulf commitment demonstrated time and again its professionalism and training by the fact that it could match it with the best. An Australian ship was one of the first ships to carry out interdiction, in conjunction with a United States ship. Of course, the media tilted massively towards the involvement of the United States ship and Australia was mentioned only in dispatches, but we were there in the beginning, during and at the end of the Gulf commitment in a very professional way. I salute that effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the Cambodian commitment continues today. A number of the members of the peacekeeping force are held by the Khmer Rouge. On Monday, as I was coming through Bangkok, I had the opportunity to meet with General Sanderson, who is the overall commander of the UNTAC force in Cambodia, and I met with Australian soldiers, directly and indirectly, when I visited Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian soldiers are carrying out that commitment with professionalism, but I warn that it is a deteriorating and extremely dangerous circumstance in Cambodia and one which we should not lose sight of because of other distractions, including the focus now turning to Somalia. I remind the House that those Australians in Cambodia are at risk from passive hazards, such as mines, and from more active hazards as the Khmer Rouge shows some of its true behaviour with its less than constructive approach&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;to the peace process in Cambodia. Today we address the Somalian commitment and we wish our contingent well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battalion grouping has a massive task ahead of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have not been in the Services would find it difficult to imagine the degree and intensity of preparation for a deployment such as this one, even though the battalion is a member of the ready deployment group. The battalion grouping will have to be as self-sufficient as possible during the 17-week deployment. This requires a special form of preparation, occurring as it does in the lead-up to the Christmas period. It is difficult to relate to lay people the extent of the complex preparation necessary for a commitment of this size and scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Parliament to pause for a moment and think also of the spouses and children who will be left behind in Townsville over the next 17 weeks. It will be anxious and stressful times for these families, but I feel confident that the Army and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will be sensitive to these issues, as was the case with the Namibian commitment and the other commitments I have mentioned, including the continuing commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there is a substantial commitment of 500 soldiers to Cambodia, and others elsewhere, I think it is fair to say that Australia's defence forces will be well and truly stretched during this time. We must remember that we will now be down to three battalions. I know the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) will dwell on this when he speaks in a moment. There will be one battalion left in Queensland, and three infantry battalions left right around Australia, during the Christmas period, which traditionally has been a critical time for bushfires, floods and other civilian emergencies requiring the involvement of the Australian armed forces. I think it is time that the Government seized the moment to reverse its decision to abolish 6 and 8/9, RAR&mdash;the two Brisbane battalions&mdash;said that it got that wrong and accepted that part of the coalition policy to reinstate those Brisbane battalions before it is too late, so ensuring our resource and security and the availability of adequate resources from the Australian Army. </PARA>

This will be tested in the first half of 1993. It is my hope that the logistic requirements will be adequately met for all our forces that are overseas, most notably the Somalian force, as well as for Australian forces in Australia as they go about their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only too obvious that the suffering of the Somalian people has been immense&mdash;and it continues. I hope that the actions being taken by the United States, Australia and others will quickly ease the burden of that suffering by the Somalian people. I think this Parliament must acknowledge the superb leadership of President Bush in taking decisive action to quickly come to grips with this desperate human tragedy. It would have been easy enough for President Bush to say, `I've had enough. I've got a few weeks left. I'm going to go on the cocktail circuit around the United States of America and leave this problem to my successor'. We would have lost a critical 10-week period in which the suffering in Somalia would have worsened. The problem would not have gone away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, he made the commitment, made the tough decision and took the action. Unbelievably, the media decided to turn it into a media circus. People from the key television programs of the United States of America were on the beaches in Somalia before the marines. The marines almost had to book to get space on the beach at the critical landing. The role of the media in modern day military activity is changing. It should not go without detailed examination. It is the cause of some concern. As important as that role is, and the freedom of the press is, it was almost absurd when the TV lights were on the beach before the marines were there, as they carried out their landing under moonlight a fortnight ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to support the remarks which have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). As the Leader of the National Party has pointed out, this is not the first occasion this year when we have had to sit here in this Parliament and contemplate a massive deployment of Australian service men and women abroad in harm's way. There can be no more deserving objective than the one for which our battalion is now to embark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This deployment has encountered virtually unanimous support, not just in this House but within the community at large, from those who have seen the tragic scenes of the stick-like, starving figures of Somalians, who have been subject to the most appalling degradation at the hands of rival warring factions. Those factions have simply not allowed the aid, which Australians and others have so generously donated, to get through. I am very glad to see the spirit which pervades the House in supporting this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I will begin by answering some of the points made by the Leader of the Opposition. They were reasonable queries but the Government has thought of them. I am able to assure the House of our support in that regard. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition asked about the funding of the commitment&mdash;the $19.5m it will cost to transport our forces to Somalia and have them there for the 17 weeks of Operation Restore Hope. That sum will not come from the defence allocation; that allocation will be supplemented so that there will be no financial effect on the ability of the ADF to carry out its mission. This was agreed to&mdash;very readily, I might say&mdash;by the Government because this operation was unforeseen and over and above the normal role for the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, in regard to the remarks that the Leader of the Opposition made about the duration of the commitment, we have taken on a commitment which is limited both in scope and in time. However, we believe that within that time the objectives of the mission will be achieved, as they have been described by the United States commander and the United States President, to bring about a situation in which the aid can get through. Therefore, the duration is limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that we are leaving open what will happen after that time. There is an ongoing United Nations mission in Somalia, UNOSOM, to which Australia has already contributed a number of troops, in the form of a movement control unit, which are on the ground now. They will, of course, help to integrate our forces into this major operation. The Government has left open what contribution will be made to that ongoing mission after the main body of our forces leaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition also made some remarks about the effect of this deployment&mdash;and I know that the Opposition spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who is at the table, has also voiced some qualms about this&mdash;on the ability of the ADF to handle this commitment and something which might arise as a matter of emergency while the battalion is in Somalia. There is no point in pretending that the ADF can handle an unlimited number of simultaneous commitments with the forces at its disposal. That should come as no surprise to anybody. There is some fearful speculation about the ability of the ADF to cope. There is no doubt that this will strain our forces. but it will not strain them to anything like the extent that has been claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter which has been mentioned in this debate and for which I have direct responsibility concerns the conditions under which the troops will serve. Those conditions have been very largely settled. They have been a matter of consideration by the Government, and they will certainly be announced before the troops depart. I believe these conditions will satisfactorily recognise the very severe conditions under which these troops are being deployed, as was the case when we sent 500 soldiers to Cambodia, as was the case when we made our commitment to the Gulf and, indeed, as has been the case in similar operations from Namibia onwards. I can signal to the House that those allowances and conditions will be broadly commensurate with the danger of this commitment and its nature, just as happened in these previous instances that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the National Party rightly pointed out, and I have direct experience of this so I would like to dwell on it for a moment, we are now participating in peacekeeping enterprises to a greater extent than at any stage in our history as a nation. As I have mentioned, we have troops in Cambodia. Troops are going to Somalia. We have a United Nations mine clearance training team on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have a contingent in the Western Sahara, the MINURSO contingent there, and we have troops engaged in the Middle East. We also make a small but important contribution to the peacekeeping operation in what was Yugoslavia. As well as that, several Australian defence officers are attached to the United Nations headquarters. They are making a very valuable contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the interjection; yes, they are good men. I think that they are contributing some very valuable expertise to what will become, I suspect, a greater function of the United Nations as time goes on. This operation brings to 14 the number of United Nations operations which have been undertaken in the last year or so. That is, in itself, about the same number as the United Nations authorised in the previous 43 years. Those officers in New York are contributing an expertise which is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that I made it my business earlier this year to visit all our peacekeeping forces, with the exception of those in Yugoslavia. I am not sure whether Colonel Wilson had got there at that stage. I found that all our troops were doing an excellent job, and that was being recognised by their peers. In Cambodia, they literally do provide the backbone of communications in a country where the communications infrastructure has been totally destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the team is operating to help clear the country of an estimated 30 million mines which have been dropped or placed during the indiscriminate warfare that has gone on in that troubled country. In the Western Sahara, in scenes which are straight out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beau Geste</EMPHASIS>, our troops are spread across the country attempting to bring about conditions under which a referendum can be held to determine the future of the constitution and the national future of that part of the world. Our longest commitment has been in the Middle East and our people there are also making an excellent contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that I should mention is the question raised by the Leader of the National Party dealing with the Ready Reserve. I would have hesitated to do so since, in a debate in which there has been so much bipartisanship, it does seem a little inappropriate to raise this matter. The argument runs that because there are now four regular brigades&mdash;and the question of terminology is one that needs thinking about&mdash;somehow or other, those battalions into which the Ready Reserve has been integrated are somehow less than potent, less than up to the task that they have been assigned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was fortunate enough to go to the passing out parade, the end of year parade at Enoggera of the division of the brigade in which the Ready Reserve has been integrated. I think that it is the largest parade I have been to. Three thousand soldiers were there. It was an extremely impressive force. On their behalf, I reject and resent the implication that this force is somehow less than ready, less than capable, less than dedicated, less than committed, less than well trained, less than the kind of force which it replaced&mdash;a rather understrength and underequipped body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In recent times I have made some remarks about the Ready Reserve and I am very pleased to say that the situation which I foresaw at that time, one in which we might well not attract sufficient numbers of people to the Ready Reserve to keep up the commitment and the plans that we have for the future, as a result perhaps of the publicity that has been engendered, will not occur and that the Ready Reserve looks like attracting the requisite numbers of people. I say on their behalf, since they cannot speak for themselves, what an excellent body of young men and women they are and what a top job they are doing for their country and will do in situations where we may need to call on them as a ready force, rather more ready than is the case with the general Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the remarks that have been made about first elevens and second elevens in the forces seem to me to be nonsensical. Those remarks betray not just a lack of knowledge of the modern military, but also a lack of knowledge of modern cricket. A different side is picked for the five-day test from that which is picked for the one-day game. Each has its role to play. It degrades or denigrates neither of them that those roles should be different. A short readiness role should be different from one which we would need to contemplate were there to be a more substantial commitment, where we needed to rely on forces that were not as ready as others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those remarks having been made, I want to conclude by saying, as have all speakers before me, how proud I am of the action the Government has taken in committing this force. I am proud of those who will be going. Like everybody else in this country, I strongly support their role. I support the men and women who will be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be for the Government to make sure of their conditions as they serve there. The fact that they get their mail on time, their pay on time should reflect the importance of this commitment. On behalf of the Government, that is an undertaking I give. It is also important that those who are left behind, the wives and husbands and loved ones of those who are going away, should also receive the support that they deserve. That, too, will be part of the Government's commitment to see to it that their welfare is protected. This is too important, too vital a national commitment and too good a cause for it to be otherwise. I salute those men and women. I wish them well in their commitment and a safe return home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister for Defence, I would also like to give my strong support to the motion moved today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to congratulate the Government on the decision it has made to send the battalion to Somalia to deal in a humanitarian way with this quite awful situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the Cold War, at the end of the super-power conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, there was no doubt that many saw that the great danger for the future was a proliferation of small localised conflicts around the world which would be extraordinarily difficult to deal with. Some of that concern has turned out to be quite well placed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, probably the most promising international development that did flow from the end of the Cold War was the establishment of what President Bush has described as the new world order&mdash;the capacity of the United Nations at long last to fulfil what one might describe as its destiny to become a body which is able not just to achieve peace around the world, but, as this operation, I think, illustrates, to impose peace where peace might otherwise not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a global structure now which enables the world to deal with the sorts of localised conflicts and crises that are predictably arising, and it is excellent to see the way the United Nations is becoming so significant in helping to achieve those objectives. The role of the United Nations in passing the appropriate resolutions of the Security Council which led to the liberation of Kuwait, its role in the Cambodian crisis&mdash;yet to be brought to fruition, but on its way, I hope&mdash;and the role which it has now been able to play in the case of Somalia is, frankly, enormously encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of these United Nations sponsored operations is absolutely critical to the future of the peace and the stability of the world. It is absolutely critical. If these types of operations do not work and if responsible countries are not prepared to support them, then that structure will fail and we will no longer have a way of dealing with conflicts of this kind. Really, though, the United Nations is coming close to achieving the vision that in the mid-1940s people like Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and others had for that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really very proud of the fact that Australia has become a major contributor to peacekeeping within the United Nations. I would only make this comment: I have never believed that the structure of the Australian Defence Force should be determined on the basis of a United Nations role. It should be determined on the principle of the defence of Australia but, nevertheless, where that force is able to be of assistance, then I am not only happy to see it contribute, but I think it is important that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Somalia, as all Australians know, is a particularly poignant one. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out, of a total population of just six million, there are two million lives threatened through starvation, famine and internal civil conflict. I thought that an article which appeared in the December edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine by Philip Ayres, an academic from Monash University, was particularly moving. In his article he described Somalia as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an anarchy so complete as to be unique in modern history&mdash;imagine the entire infrastructure of society destroyed down to such basics as water supply, sanitation and electricity, not to speak of services like the telephone and the post, let alone the law.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members would be aware of reports constantly coming out of Somalia of a desperate situation in that country. In his article, Philip Ayres made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One desperately wants the Magnificent Seven to ride into town, but they won't.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to feel that, whilst the Magnificent Seven, of course, will not ride into town, something more constructive is now happening, and that is that Operation Restore Hope is taking place and that we will at last see some stability return to that poor and troubled country and that lives will be saved. As I said, I am very pleased that Australia is making a contribution to relieving this terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations Security Council passed its resolution in support of what became Operation Restore Hope, I put out a press release saying that I hoped that Australia would make a contribution to it, and although I have to say that Senator Ray responded with a rather political remark that I was being far too gung ho, I am glad to say that the Government, on greater reflection and particularly after representations came from the United States Government, decided to act. So, the Government has responded to the request of the United States. It has done that with the support, I think, of the whole of this Parliament&mdash;I hope so and I am sure so&mdash;and the battalion from the operational deployment force in Townsville is now to go for a period of 17 weeks, or approximately four months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That battalion will join not only the troops of the United States, who are already doing a sterling job in Somalia, but also troops from France, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia and I think one or two other Arab states. The Australian battalion will be under the command of Colonel Bill Mellor, assisted by Lieutenant Colonel David Hurley. I know both of those officers have a high reputation for their professionalism and ability. I wish them well in their great responsibilities, not only for the battalion but also for the continuing high reputation of the Australian Defence Force and Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operational deployment force&mdash;the most ready part of the Australian Army&mdash;is an extraordinarily professional body. I had the pleasure of visiting the force in Townsville five or six weeks ago. I spent a whole day with them and I can only say that I was extremely impressed with the level of training and commitment of all I met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the risks in the case of Somalia will range from medium possibly to very high. It is noteworthy that amongst these is not only the risk of being attacked by the armed gangs which roam around Somalia, but also the risk of disease and general quality of life. I think it is important that the House take account of that. These very professional men and women are entering an environment with a reasonably high&mdash;and possibly a very high&mdash;level of risk. I hope that we will not let that fact slip from our minds. They are our fellow Australians, they are extraordinarily professional Australians and we wish them the very best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will be involved in Operation Restore Hope which will fall into four phases, the first of which is pretty much complete. The first phase of Operation Restore Hope was to secure the airport and seaport at Mogadishu and subsequently deploy to Baidoa. As honourable members will have seen on the news last night, the deployment to Baidoa has been successful and Mogadishu airport and the seaport have both been secured as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second phase of the operation is to facilitate food distribution in those areas. The third phase is then to expand the operation to the south. I imagine that the Australian battalion will be involved particularly in the expansion of the operation to the south of Somalia. The north of Somalia is in a much stronger position. The food distribution system there is better and the humanitarian problems are nothing like as great as they are in the south. That is why Operation Restore Hope is focusing initially, after Mogadishu and Baidoa, on the south of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth phase of the operation, which is likely to be completed in anything up to four months, will be the hand-over of the operation generally to UNOSOM, which is the peacekeeping force to which we are making a contribution, as the Prime Minister has pointed out. That peacekeeping force will replace Operation Restore Hope which is effectively a peace-making force. I think we are all very proud that the Australian Defence Force is taking part in this exercise. All Australians are extremely confident that our force will perform very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have raised a range of issues which have been discussed already in this debate and which I have discussed with officials from the Department of Defence. The more I learn about the Government's planning of this operation, the more satisfied I become that many of the issues which could be of concern have been thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I think the Government has addressed the very important issue of command and control quite appropriately. As the Prime Minister said, the command and control arrangements will be very much the same as the arrangements that applied during the Gulf war with, at the end of the day, national command remaining with Australia. Those who are interested in military history will not forget that one of our great mistakes was to let national command be taken over altogether on occasions by the British during the First World War. I think many Australians feel that they probably got a fairly raw deal as a consequence. National command should always remain with us, as Australians, and in this case ultimately that will be so&mdash;although the day-to-day operations will be coordinated by the coalition commander who is an American. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of engagement have not yet been determined, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) pointed out. I look forward to getting at least a private briefing on what the rules of engagement will be once they have been coordinated with the United States. But I make the simple point that our troops must have the unequivocal right of self-defence. I am sure the rules of engagement will guarantee that right of self-defence. I think the Prime Minister has alluded to that being the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel also referred to the conditions of service for the soldiers who are going to Somalia. I am sorry that those conditions of service cannot be announced today because it is important that they are sorted out as soon as possible. The last thing we want in these cases is some unseemly haggling at the end of the operation as to conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government should announce the provision of a daily allowance as quickly as possible. I understand the figure being looked at is $68 per day. It should also announce that the tax exemptions which are usually provided in these circumstances will apply. Again, we do not want any unseemly haggling with the Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office. This is an extraordinarily important matter. Given that our soldiers will experience a level of risk ranging from medium to very high, those appropriate conditions of service should be looked after properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel referred to the $19 1/2m being provided by a supplementation rather than coming out of the Defence budget. That was the first public acknowledgment of that supplementation and I am very pleased that the money will be made available in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is in relation to the media. I understand that a very large media contingent will be going to Somalia with the battalion. Of course, I do not dispute the simple proposition that Australians not only have an interest in what their troops are doing overseas, but also have a right to know, at least to some extent, how they are faring. We want to know how they are faring, but we do not want the media getting in the way. We do not want the media sinking to its occasionally callous levels, particularly in relation to the Somalians themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others have spoken about the way the media behaved when the Americans first landed in Somalia. I must admit the cartoons which appeared in newspapers subsequent to that event summed up very clearly the insensitivity of the media. I hope that the Australian media contingent going to Somalia with our battalion will behave with a much greater degree of sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish the battalion the very best. I wish our soldiers great safety and good fortune. On behalf of all members of the coalition, I send very best wishes to their families and loved ones&mdash;most of whom will be in Townsville, but wherever they may be. I know they will be concerned and anxious during this period. I want them to know that our thoughts are with them and that we are extraordinarily proud of the Australian Defence Force and of the battalion which is going to Somalia to deal with an extremely serious and pathetic human crisis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expresses its profound sympathy on behalf of all Australians for the suffering being endured by the people of Somalia as a result of famine, clan warfare and banditry;</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, virtually from its inception, this tragic country of Somalia has endured and suffered warfare and political instability on a scale which is hard for Australians to conceive. Even today, in the southern and northern parts of Somalia there are disputes obtaining as to ownership of parcels of Somalia and as to whether certain sections of the population can live with other citizens. The inability to resolve this unfortunate and tragic circumstance is creating great suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental freedoms annunciated by the United Nations was the freedom from want. Another one of the fundamental freedoms was the freedom from fear. These two freedoms in particular have been denied to the people of Somalia. Indeed, a situation of absolute barbarism has been going on in Somalia for some years. Even before President Barre was removed from office there was banditry, civil insurrection, armed conflict and wide scale barbarism in a way which is unknown to this country. The majority of our people would be incapable of even understanding the barbarism that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of the world expressed great hope when the United Nations was formed that the United Nations itself would take a far more active role in the protection of people's freedoms and liberties and also that it would have the ability to intervene within nations to secure those rights if those rights were denied to those citizens. This was borne out of the failure of the League of Nations, particularly in Abyssinia, or Ethiopia&mdash;where the League of Nations failed, through cowardice and appeasement, to uphold those basic freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this House should pay tribute to President Bush for his initiative in spurring the United Nations to take action to deploy United Nations forces to Somalia to ensure the pacification of the country so as to enable humanitarian aid to be distributed to the starving millions in Somalia. It sometimes occurs to me: what would happen if the United States did not take these steps to spur the United Nations, or spur the conscience of the world, to take this humanitarian action to protect the people of Somalia? I fear that without the moral leadership of the United States this action may not have occurred. Indeed, I am unaware of any report in the United Nations where one country out of 160 of the United Nations has taken those necessary steps and said, `We as a nation will deploy our forces to ensure the success of the operation and the survival of the people of Somalia'. I pay tribute to President Bush for his outstanding leadership not only on this occasion but also on many previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Government on its ready acceptance of the request by the United States Government, through our distinguished visitor, Ambassador Mel Sembler, for the provision of Australian ground forces to Somalia. I believe that is consistent with the reaction of the Australian Government when assistance was requested to assist the United Nations operations in the Gulf war Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm to ensure the freeing of Kuwait and the liberty of the people of Kuwait. I believe that this ready acceptance by the Australian Government signals to the nations in our immediate region that Australia does have the backbone and is prepared to deploy its military forces within United Nations confines, resolutions, to ensure that these basic liberties are upheld and that people's basic human rights are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the units in the Australian Army, it gives me great pleasure to know that the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment has been selected to participate in Operation Restore Hope for its pacification role and to enable the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of Somalia. The 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment is one of the most highly trained battalions in the Australian Army and has a distinguished record of service in wartime which, in my view, is not exceeded by any other unit of the Australian Defence Force. We are extremely proud of that battalion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battalion's duties will be to ensure that the area of operations within which it will undertake its responsibilities will be pacified and that, upon pacification being achieved, the provision of humanitarian aid can be supplied to the starving people in Somalia. It has been decided by the Australian Government that the force will be in Somalia for 17 weeks. I would think that the timeframe nominated by the Government was simply a guide at this stage and that, if the battalion or its replacement were essential for the duties that have to be performed in Somalia, the Government would accede to that request by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, some matters which I wish to touch on with respect to the deployment of the battalion. The first concern I had initially was the absence of artillery support to the battalion. I know from a briefing that artillery support will be available from United States forces. On reflection, I would have preferred that the Australian force had its own artillery support, or New Zealand artillery support, for the battalion. That is a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I believe that it is fundamental for the battalion to be fully motorised. I know that 30 armoured personnel carriers&mdash;that is, a small squadron of APCs&mdash;will accompany the battalion in its deployment to Somalia, as well as a number of trucks. It is essential that Headquarters Australia Defence Force ensure that the battalion and its supporting elements are fully motorised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I urge the Australian Government to ensure that the force has an indigenous medivac capability. I have been briefed that medivac capability will be provided by United States forces, but I still adhere to the view that we should have our own medivac capability. Fourthly, I believe that we should have both first line and second line repair capability for the equipments that are being deployed to Somalia and also that the Australian Government should not rule out the option of providing helicopter air mobile capability to the Australian battalion if so required and if any problems were being experienced by the Australian contingent in obtaining readily air mobile capability, and in particular air mobile fire power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battalion will be tented in Somalia in the area of operations and will rely to a great extent on the logistics support of the United States. The point should be made that Australia will pay its own way throughout these operations. I know it is a sense of pride to Australia that on every deployment that Australia has made, wherever it has taken place, we have paid our own way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The soldiers deployed to Somalia will enjoy full repatriation benefits on their return to Australia. They will receive the appropriate allowances. I have asked the Australian Defence Force to ensure that there is a weekly deployment of a C130 to Somalia to bring mail and other necessary equipments to the force to ensure that regular contact is maintained between Australia and our soldiers in Somalia. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) gave an ironclad guarantee that the mail for our soldiers in Somalia would be delivered to them on time and without any delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention a few other matters about our involvement in the United States forces. Firstly, what happened to our Australian soldiers in Morocco should never be allowed to happen again. Their steyr weapons and raven radios were taken from them and stored in facilities which I am not certain were secure. The raven radio is one of the most sophisticated pieces of tactical radio communications in the world&mdash;perhaps the best. It appals me that that piece of equipment was out of the possession of Australian soldiers for a certain period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as removing personal weapons from Australian soldiers deployed overseas is concerned, that is simply not an option. If there is no need for personal weapons to accompany the soldiers, then it is my belief that civilians should be deployed to that particular area. I have confidence that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) will never allow that situation to obtain again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to note that the Australian Government will be providing supplementary funding to the Defence float in excess of $19m to pay for our commitment to Somalia. This is fundamentally important at a time when the Defence budget has been stretched to the limit, and when there is virtually no fat whatsoever in the Defence budget. It is very important that headquarters of the Australian Defence Force has that undertaking from the Government to ensure that there will be no intrusion by the cost of this operation into our Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following point on the rules of engagement: there must be no constraints on Australian soldiers in Somalia in respect of, firstly, defending their own persons; secondly, the security of the battalion unit as a whole; and, thirdly, the discharge of their legitimate operations to ensure the pacification within their area of operations and the provision of humanitarian aid. They must not be constrained by unrealistic rules of engagement. I know that Colonel Bill Mellor and Lieutenant Colonel David Hurley will perform their duties in the highest traditions of the Australian Army and that they will bring credit not only to the battalion but also to Australian military forces in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are preparing a major program in Townsville to farewell the soldiers from Lavarack Barracks on their deployment to Somalia and to wish them well and godspeed. We will ensure that the families of the soldiers are given all the necessary support we can possibly give them whilst their loved ones are away, serving our country on behalf of the United Nations, and that they are not forgotten. I know that much effort is being devoted in that regard in Townsville. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Bass moving forthwith that Mr Speaker no longer possesses the confidence of this House for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) That in the discharge of his duties as joint administrator of the Joint House Department he did knowingly sign an official report of that Department to the Parliament which included an anonymous reference to a public liability compensation settlement to himself without giving any personal explanation to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)That the Speaker has failed to protect the dignity of the Parliament by consistently seeking to hide the facts surrounding his compensation claim and subsequent settlement from the Parliament and people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking in support of the suspension of Standing Orders to subsequently move the motion of no confidence in the Speaker, I commence by stating that it is a serious matter for this chamber and the coalition to contemplate moving a suspension of Standing Orders in the terms that we have. I did not seek to intervene in private members' business&mdash;although I sought the call this morning to ask the Speaker a question&mdash;and I did not seek to intervene in the discussion that has just taken place about the matters in Somalia. I note the comments of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). We joined him and others in a bipartisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bicycle incident is a matter which is central to the credibility of the Speaker's role, and there can be no graver issue for the Parliament. That is why I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to move the motion of no confidence. In a sense, the Speaker has been caught out. He failed to notify the House that he had instituted proceedings against the Joint House Department, which he is charged to administer. As a servant of the Crown and the House, he failed to notify the House that he had received compensation for a public liability claim he had instituted against the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quantum of the $65,000 has raised eyebrows. As I and my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who is seconding my motion, will illustrate, it appears that the quantum of that amount is extraordinary. But it raises a range of questions. This morning I wanted to ask the Speaker whether he was going to come to the Parliament today&mdash;our last day of sitting&mdash;having been denied a Question Time today, to explain in a great deal of detail the basis of the charge that I make on behalf of the coalition today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the coalition playing politics with this issue. Many honourable members on the Speaker's side of the chamber were also surprised, to say the least, when they heard the amount and the circumstances of its uncovering. I think all would have felt that if a man or a woman had been injured and there was some legitimacy in the claim&mdash;that remains to be proven; I do not cast aspersions on that because we have not had the benefit of the legal advice&mdash;the opportunity to explain should have been taken some considerable time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find from the Speaker's own statement, following a question from my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) yesterday, that this accident took place on 25 April&mdash;Anzac Day&mdash;in 1990. He had an accident outside the precincts of the Parliament. We understand it occurred down by the lake when he was riding a bicycle, which he states was hired from the Health and Recreation Centre at Parliament House. That raises the question: was it hired, borrowed or on loan? Somehow or other, he had an accident. The circumstances of the accident have not been explained, but I understand it went something like this: he took the bike, hired or otherwise&mdash;and those bikes were available to honourable members&mdash;and somewhere along the way it is alleged that the bike broke in half. He fell off, rolled on to his face and hands and, subsequently, suffered a chipped forearm which required some attention. It was on that basis that he instituted proceedings through his own solicitors and a settlement ensued between his own solicitors and the Commonwealth in an amount of $65,000. That does not explain whether legal fees were covered and what the quantum was made up of. Was it an assessment as to the extent of the injury? Was it an assessment as to loss of&mdash;</PARA>

As people would expect, this matter has been the subject of great discussion around here. We understand&mdash;it is available to the Speaker to reject this interpretation&mdash;that he went to the Joint House Department and said, `No, I'll put the bike together'. He put it together and then took it away. If that were the case, there would be some element of contributory negligence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that he ought to be given the opportunity to answer the gravamen of these charges, and they are serious charges. I do not believe it is appropriate, and the community would not expect it to be appropriate, for the Speaker to actually and intently not seek to disclose fully the benefit that he received. This came to light in the annual report of the Joint House Department, and I ask honourable members to remember that this event took place in 1990. There was even reporting of this accident of the Speaker. There was never any report that he was seeking a claim&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to come to that. There was never any disclosure until this report became available. In my office I found it on page 130 of an appendix attached to this report. All it says under the headings of `Fraud Control' and `Claims and Losses' is that in 1991-92 the Department had three public liability claims settled. The first two claims were for $325 and $20,000. Then there is an interesting sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third case resulted in payments for medical expenses and a public liability settlement totalling $65 000. All of the reported details exclude the cost of legal representation for the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>That $65,000 seems a fairly extraordinary amount. There are some learned lawyers on this side of the House, and I am sure there are on the other side. I am only a suburban solicitor and another lawyer in parliament, but $65,000 appears to me to be a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to try to balance that amount against some other assessments of quantum that might be available to those who receive compensation in the public liability sense or a workers compensation sense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the point I made about the quantum is well made by citing that example out of the Queensland legislation. Similarly, if we look at the ACT workers compensation legislation where there is a basic limit of $20,000, that also makes the point. I come back to the issue of why we want Standing Orders suspended, and the basis of the motion that I wish to move: that is, that Mr Speaker has failed to protect the dignity of the Parliament and has not brought forward in an open way the fact that he has received this payment. We went to his pecuniary interests statement, and that also raises an interesting issue. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is unclear from the resolutions of the House whether it is necessary to notify it, I advise that a personal injury accident claim against the Commonwealth has been settled.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no reference to the amount that is being proposed. I would have thought that the Speaker, of all people, ought to be aware of the requirements of the pecuniary interests register.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before the House is a serious one. The Opposition has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to get an explanation from Mr Speaker for receiving this outrageous sum of money, $65,000, the details of which have not been explained to this House as to what are the general damages, what are the special damages, and what legal fees are involved. Yesterday it was revealed in this House that $65,000 of taxpayers' money was paid by the Speaker, in effect, to  himself, for being out of control on a bicycle. He issued a press statement in which he claimed, among other things, that `This was a normal public liability claim'. Quite clearly it was not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A circumstance where the Speaker instructs his solicitor to sue the Commonwealth in the stead of his Department, the Joint House Department, cannot be described as `normal'&mdash;abnormal would be a more accurate description. We seek to suspend Standing Orders to get further information, for the statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quantum of the settlement was recommended by the Australian Government Solicitor not the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommended by whom? Solicitors, including the Australian Government Solicitor, have to have clients. They do not act of their own volition. Who was the client? The client, of course, in this action brought by the Speaker was the Speaker's own  Department, the Joint House Department. He presides over it&mdash;none other than the unbalanced bicyclist himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be ludicrous, if it were not obscene, because the statement begs the following questions: who recommended to the Government Solicitor that this matter be settled? On whose authority was the instruction given to settle the matter? Furthermore, who was the principal officer in the Joint House Department, over which the Speaker presides, who was dealing with the Australian Government Solicitor? Whoever he was, he is, quite clearly, answerable directly to the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stripping aside the legal niceties and why we have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to get more information, the fact is that the Speaker instructed his solicitor to sue his Department on his behalf. He therefore sued, settled, and had compensation paid to himself. He was both the plaintiff and, in effect, the defendant. What a rort! The pigs of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not get their snouts into a bigger trough. Already the lawyers must be gathering in Canberra to get their slice of these rich pickings. The House deserves and is entitled to a full and adequate explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How was the $65,000 of taxpayers' money calculated? Who requested it? Who handled it? What role did the litigant, as both the plaintiff and the effective defendant, play in this? How does the payment of $65,000 of taxpayers' money equate with normal compensation payments for a sore elbow and a broken arm, which allegedly no longer bends as easily as before? What is the impairment? Is there a claim for pain and suffering? Is there a claim for loss of enjoyment of life? What was the amount for general damages? What was the amount for special damages? How does he explain the basic conflict of interest that he, as a plaintiff, is effectively suing himself and making the payment out of other people's money, namely, the taxpayers' money, to satisfy this alleged claim?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was invited yesterday by the Speaker in the House, as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would show, to contact his solicitors, MacPhillamy Cummins and Gibson. I had my staff ring the Speaker's office approximately six hours and 40 minutes ago to get the name of the solicitor handling the matter and it has not been provided. There is every justification for coming in here now to get this dirty, rotten rort explained to the Australian people&mdash;an explanation as to how someone can fall off a bicycle provided by himself, institute the proceedings himself, and assess virtually himself just what he is entitled to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ultimate element of sham in this particular proposition comes with the questions asked by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Smith) when he got up in this place and declared himself sober. He said, `I am pursuing this with sobriety. Unaccustomed as people are to seeing me in a sober condition I am nevertheless pursuing this'&mdash;and these are his words&mdash;`with sobriety'. He may have pursued it with sobriety, but he also apparently pursued it with illiteracy. Evidently he has had some degree of difficulty comprehending the series of answers given to questions in the Senate on this matter. The questions raised were answered precisely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go through the answers that have been provided to those particular questions in the Senate you will see these things. You asked, for example, what were the Government costs associated with this action. Again, this raises the question of motive. Why should he stand up here and pillory these questions as being unanswered when in fact they have been answered? Specifically it was said, `Oh, we don't know how much the Government costs were relating to the $65,000 which were perhaps being paid out in association with the Speaker. It could be millions associated with the Government side of the case'. Here is what has been said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government Solicitor engaged a barrister and has passed the cost of $500 on to the Joint House Department. To assist in the consideration of issues arising in the case the Joint House Department obtained expert technical advice on the bikes at a cost of approximately $800.</PARA>
<PARA>So the millions in costs it is alleged to have cost the taxpayer through the Government is of course somewhat retarded. It was asked, `What was the $65,000 for?'. Effectively it was $51,000 for damages, close to $4,000 for medical expenses and $10,000 for legal expenses. That is how the $65,000 was arrived at. If we go through these answers we will see the detail of the accident which caused the action to take place, and the fact that there was an area of negligence when specific instructions issued to the Joint House Department for the use of the bikes were not passed on to the user of the bikes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of RAAF Base Scherger at Peppan, Cape York Peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to a policy of defence self-reliance with a framework of alliances and agreements. Consistent with this policy, it is necessary to provide a RAAF airfield on Cape York Peninsula. This proposal will provide facilities as the initial development of the base which is to support Australian Defence Force activities in the north-east of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The base will complete the chain of RAAF airfields across Australia's north and provide a base for deployment and coverage of the sea-air gap during a contingency. In peacetime, the primary purpose for the airfield will be for exercises and deployments. During exercise periods, there could be about 20 aircraft and 400 RAAF personnel deployed at the airfield. It will be able to accommodate up to 1,500 military personnel if a combined or joint force exercise is held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities to be provided at the airfield site will cater for aircraft operations, aircraft parking, navigational aids, fuel and equipment storage and accommodation. These facilities will be the minimum to support military aircraft operations. The airfield will contain a 3,050-metre runway and associated taxiways. The estimated total project cost of the proposed scope of works, including consultants fees, is $166.65m at December 1991 prices. Completion of the initial works will be commensurate with Department of Defence priorities and cash availability. However, current plans envisage completion by 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Committee recommended that development of RAAF base Scherger at Peppan, Cape York Peninsula should proceed but raised the following specific issues. First, provided the site of the proposed out-station is outside the core area, defence should liaise with the local Aboriginal community about its development and access. Second, an energy audit of RAAF base Curtin, both during stand-downs and deployments and exercises should be undertaken during the development of RAAF base Scherger and, where relevant, the recommendations of the energy audit be applied to facilities and other structures being provided at RAAF base Scherger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, a plan should be developed for the protection from bushfires of combustible facilities and structures on the base. Fourth, before the haulage of hard rock from the bald hill quarry site commences, Defence should develop a plan to minimise dust level on the haulage road and this plan should be implemented. Haulage contractors should be required to observe all reasonable precautions to ensure that the safety of motorists on the peninsula developmental road is not compromised by heavy truck usage during the haulage period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended that Defence should encourage the use of the local work force and assist potential local tenderers in bidding for jobs. A further recommendation was made that Defence should continue the already extensive process of consultation during the construction and post-construction phases, and Defence should consider using the Army for future major defence works of a similar nature. Defence agrees with and will take action on all of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the proposed Aboriginal out-station, Defence will need to confirm that it is outside the core area and that its location is compatible with Defence master planning for the airfield development.

<PARA>The Australian Government in February 1991 purchased a block of land of some 3.7 hectares as a site for the embassy complex. The site is located about three kilometres from the central business district. The site comprises the remains of a significant estate and contains an old house which, with the prior agreement of the Public Works Committee, is being renovated and extended for a head of mission residence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When fully developed, the site will contain a chancery, head of mission residence, six units of staff accommodation and recreation facilities. The purchase of the site was partly funded by the sale of the current head of mission residence and one staff residence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current property holdings in Suva consist of an unsatisfactory leased chancery on two floors of a high-rise office building, an ambassador's residence and 11 leased and nine owned staff residences. The existing chancery is far from appropriate. It has physical security problems, the services&mdash;particularly lift and air-conditioning services&mdash;are run-down, and the chancery space does not adequately cater for the staff already in Suva. The landlord does not wish to renew the lease beyond the current lease expiry date in November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently 21 Australian based staff in Suva. Rents are rising and final development will permit the construction of seven residential units, including the head of mission residence. The chancery is to be of a standard appropriate to Australia's representational requirements in Fiji, facilitating political, cultural, immigration, aid and defence interests and supporting Australia's national interests and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chancery has been designed to accommodate the existing office staff of 21 Australian based and 38 locally engaged, and has the capacity to absorb another nine Australian based and six locally engaged staff. This is in accordance with the projected staffing estimates of the represented departments. It is also possible to extend the building envelope to add a further 100 metres of floor space if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of mission residence is being built to standards appropriate to the size and importance of Suva, as determined by the Overseas Property Committee. It will include four bedrooms, a family area and service facilities in the new construction and reception, dining, kitchen and study in the renovated area of the old house. Domestic quarters have been provided in a new building separate from the main residence building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff residential units will be constructed suitable for Fijian conditions and of a size appropriate to the area standards for the various categories of officers in the mission. The grounds of the site will be enclosed by a 2.4-metre high fence, which will provide both security and visual protection. Extensive consultation on the development of the proposal was undertaken with all departments with representation in Suva and with unions and staff associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limit of cost estimate for the chancery and one staff residence, as presented to the Public Works Committee, is $7.261m at July 1992 prices.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Australian Embassy staff apartments at Attakarn Prasit, Bangkok, Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA>This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 7 October 1992 and the Committee has now duly reported to parliament. The proposed work will optimise our prime site's potential at Soi Attakarn Prasit, comprising approximately 7,000 square metres which is currently underdeveloped. To accomplish this we propose to demolish the existing eight staff townhouses and construct 51 apartments and associated amenities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main elements of the proposed work are two apartment blocks, each of six levels plus a basement; an amenities area on the ground floor of one apartment block with a lounge, kitchen, children's playroom and a general recreation room; a tennis court and general landscaping; staff basement car parking; and outside visitors car parking. The existing swimming pool will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The design of the building has regard to climate, local building practice, energy conservation and staff needs for security and privacy. The site is surrounded by a perimeter fence, with two separate means of egress. The main gate will be controlled from a guard post within the grounds. The proposal has received support from embassy staff. There are considerable problems in finding suitable accommodation within easy reach of the chancery. It is not unusual for staff to spend hours per day travelling to and from work. There is also a lack of suitable amenities for families with smaller children&mdash;for example, safe playgrounds. </PARA>

Australian firms currently operating in Thailand with the necessary experience in construction of this type will be given the opportunity to tender. The contractor will be encouraged to use Australian products and materials where it is practical to do so. The limit of cost estimate of the proposed works, as presented to the Public Works Committee, is $16m at August 1992 prices.

<PARA>Lavarack barracks is the home of 3 Brigade, the Army's Ready Development Force. It was originally built in two stages. In 1965-66 facilities were built for a three-battalion task force and in 1980-81 facilities were built for additional logistic units to support the operational deployment force. Various changes over the years have led to unsatisfactory arrangements in some areas in respect of zoning, functional relationships, scales and standards of accommodation, and inappropriate use of buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is the first of a multi-stage project for the provision of modern working and training facilities at Lavarack barracks.

<PARA>Badgerys Creek is located in the Liverpool local government area, some 46 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. The site is 20 kilometres west of Liverpool, 20 kilometres south-east of Penrith and 23 kilometres north-west of Campbelltown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of 40 years several studies have been carried out in relation to a site for a proposed second Sydney airport. In February 1986 the Government announced that Badgerys Creek had been selected as the site. Acquisition commenced in that year and has now been completed. Following evaluation of airport needs in the Sydney basin, in March 1989 the Government announced a comprehensive and integrated strategy which included at Badgerys Creek the commencement of a staged development of a second major Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airport will be operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a lease agreement with an option to purchase at any time. The first stage of the development will provide a general aviation airport which has been designed to facilitate expansion in further stages to accommodate domestic and international development. The facilities to be provided will include a sealed runway, parallel taxiway, aircraft parking, runway and taxiway lighting, an access road and parking together with a small terminal building. Also involved will be cut to fill earthworks, site services including water supply, drainage and sewerage including on-site sewerage treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the work has been estimated at an indicative cost not to exceed $56.1m at December 1990 prices. In its report, the Public Works Committee agrees that there is need for a second major airport in the Sydney basin and that the Badgerys Creek site is the most suitable location for the airport. The Committee also believes that the master plan for the long term development of the airport at Badgerys Creek is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the PWC raises the following specific issues. The Committee believes that the Federal Airports Corporation's proposal places too much emphasis on passenger demand and does not take account of the potential growth of freight services to the Asia-Pacific region or the scope for industrial growth in the western region of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that a staged development strategy for Badgerys Creek airport is appropriate, but has indicated that the initial development should provide for a 2,900-metre runway, not an 1,800-metre runway as proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation. The Committee recommends that the FAC should prepare and cost as a matter of urgency its proposal for a longer runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would inevitably involve considerable delay, and there is no justification for any further delay in the commencement of work on the airport at Badgerys Creek. The FAC's plans do not preclude the subsequent development of a substantially larger runway at an appropriate time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) has advised that he will ask the FAC to immediately re-examine the opportunities for international air freight services at Badgerys Creek. In the light of that examination, he will also seek the FAC's advice on the viability of bringing forward subsequent stages of development to cater for international freight services. This analysis will proceed in parallel with the detailed design work on the 1,800-metre runway project. </PARA>

The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> this morning states that the potential with regard to the development of the Badgerys Creek international airport `is huge and the opportunity is priceless'. Indeed it is. The editorial goes on to outline some of the quite dramatic and useful aspects of the development of the Badgerys Creek international airport, which will be to the benefit of western Sydney in particular and the State and the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity for the rapid development of the site selected as the next international airport for the greater Sydney area ought not to be lost. For some time now I have been lobbying for a greater emphasis to be placed on the construction of this new airport, together with the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and other members who have been very much in the forefront with regard to this new construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have placed emphasis on the need to have a much longer runway put in place in the first instance. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) in his report on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a little earlier said that this will be taken into account and that it will still be possible to proceed with an additional runway of a length beyond the 1,800 metres which has been recommended in the FAC report at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> made a very strong point with regard to grasping the opportunity now in order to get this whole infrastructure project up and running as soon as possible. It is the policy of the Opposition to support the establishment of the longest runway possible. The plans show that the longest runway is to be 4,000 metres, or four kilometres, in length, which should take any aircraft in the foreseeable future and through most of the next century. That runway ought to be in place. From that point on, the infrastructure of freight terminals and other operating facilities can be constructed on a privatisation basis by the people who want to operate through the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also support the recommendation in the report with regard to acquiring land within the 35 ANEF zone or the footprint that is covered by that particular area. Some years ago when I first came into this Parliament, I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the things that concerned the Committee members as they travelled around Australia&mdash;for example, at the RAAF base at Edinburgh&mdash;was the fact that local councils and State governments had been, in the mind of the Committee, quite negligent with regard to the development they had allowed to take place within the precincts of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we were amazed to find that we were standing in a new development only some hundreds of yards across an open paddock from the end of the runway at RAAF base Edinburgh. It was quite surprising that these developments had been allowed to take place. We were also shocked to find out&mdash;although all these matters have now been dealt with in some way&mdash;that the local council had agreed to allow a tip to be established some short distance from the end of the runway at Edinburgh. This would have dragged in myriads of seagulls and created quite a hazard for the aircraft that were flying in and out of the Edinburgh air base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise the need for local governments, State governments and Commonwealth authorities to make sure that we do not fall into that trap at Badgerys Creek. It must be an absolute priority to have the required amount of land to give a clear, curfew free area for the airport to operate around the clock. Everything possible that should be done through voluntary acquisition or whatever else may be needed ought to be done. There should be firm and fast rules in place that will not allow development to take place so that people get too closely settled in around the airport in later years. This is beginning to happen around Tullamarine airport. This creates all sorts of problems as people begin to protest about the noise factors and so on. Yet, the airport at Tullamarine was in place long before much of that development took place. </PARA>

Let us put it at such a strength now that it will be just a continuation of that runway. Unfortunately, we will not get the huge and priceless prize. That, I believe, is a pity.

What did the Government say? It said, `No. When the demand is shown, we will do it then'. But perhaps the demand will never be shown. The demand would be shown if the Government were to go ahead and put the airport there. So, the members of the Committee are disappointed. </PARA>

Whether or not an election is coming up, the reality is that the demand of air traffic coming into Australia, and especially into Sydney, is going to grow at a phenomenal rate during the rest of this decade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of parliament for an electorate in western Sydney, I want to express a few personal views in that capacity. That is to say, frankly, I share a little degree of disappointment in the reception of the report of the Public Works Committee and, I guess, the haste with which decisions have been made. I do not and never have sought to get involved in the politics of the Badgerys Creek airport. I think that it is too important an issue for the people of western Sydney. But from my own perspective, I wanted to put a few things on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I think that it is a little difficult to suggest that it is easy at a later date to have the longer runway, 1,800 metres to 2,900 metres. In fact, it is not possible just to add in length to that existing runway. My understanding is that it has to be replaced. Secondly, I would point out that it is quite reasonable for some people to perhaps welcome this as an initiative that is going to create some jobs on a modest level, and progress can be seen towards getting this general airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the option of losing at an earlier stage the international and domestic capability is going to translate into a loss of the earlier presence of quite significant numbers of jobs. Whilst estimating jobs is always quite difficult, I note that the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils has suggested that there could be some 36,000 jobs generated as a consequence of the adoption of the report of the Public Works Committee, chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). So to that extent, I think it is very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already said that if this Government has done anything in the area of civil aviation, it has introduced a robust competition policy. That needs to be extended to airports. It is a very understandable proposition that the FAC will always seek to recover its sunk investment at Kingsford-Smith and, whether consciously or unconsciously, seek to delay the development of a larger airport and capacity at Badgerys Creek. I think that the tantalising prospect that the honourable member for Throsby and his Committee presented to people in the western suburbs is that that aspiration of having an international and domestic airport could have been achieved perhaps in a much earlier time frame than had previously been considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this whole second airport has taken some 20 years, it is a pity that we could not have perhaps been a little bit more optimistic in our approach, but that being said, it is pleasing to see that we will get a general airport and that work can commence. I guess it is up to the community, WESROC and Federal members to see what can be done in the future in terms of expediting the provision of a domestic and international terminal. </PARA>

What the Minister has, in fact, said today, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), is that it is a mickey mouse solution.

Secondly, the Committee believes that relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong will not adversely effect the functions of the office.

It did not matter what the cost was to taxpayers and it did not matter what the implications were for the efficiency of the organisation. That is precisely what is happening in the case of the Australian Hydrographic Office. For the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) to come into this House and claim that this decision is supported by Defence is an extremely offensive thing to do, because it is not supported by Defence. No-one in the Navy will put his hand up without coercion. No-one in the Navy will put his hand up and say that he thinks this is a good decision, because of course no-one does.

What they should do is look at the objective advice that was given to the Government by the Australian Public Service and in particular by Mr Andrew Podger, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisition and Logistics, Department of Defence. Surely the Labor Party is not claiming that Mr Podger is some kind of incompetent, that he is a man who cannot be trusted, that he is a partisan figure. Not at all. Mr Podger is a highly respected public servant in the best traditions of the Australian Public Service. Let us look at the advice he gave to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in April 1992. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On such assumptions, the conclusion is that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leichhardt remains the preferred location on cost-benefit grounds;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant margin.</PARA>
<PARA>But, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, the proposal is still supported by the Australian Defence Force. However, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisition and Logistics, told the Minister that Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant margin. Mr Podger added that non-financial factors are further reasons why the move to Wollongong should not take place. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of non-financial factors also suggest that the Sydney. . . option should be preferred.</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Secretary claims that Defence supports this decision. It is a pity that we have the documents that prove he is wrong. Mr Podger went on to say:</PARA>

He said, `Okay.

It has always been like this and it always will.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Parliamentary Secretary argued in his speech that one of the reasons the taxpayer needed to build a spanking new building at Wollongong was that the building in North Sydney had eight floors and there is a lot of rushing around from floor to floor.

A few of the staff have resigned, but in any organisation there is a 20 per cent turnover of staff in any one year. It might even be better if occasionally a few members of parliament resigned and this brought a little bit of new blood into the place.

If one looks at the timetabling&mdash;and I am not sure whether Opposition members have had preselections in the Liberal Party in their own circumstances, but there are probably a few on the other side that have not, and occasionally we get involved in them on this side of the House&mdash;the preselection process to which he referred, involving another member of the Labor Party and me, actually took place on 27 June, some three days after the announcement was made by the Minister here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members are telling me that people are likely to change their minds about a preselection ballot in a three-day period, clearly they have not been through too many preselection ballots, and certainly not too many on our side of the House. It is absolute rubbish. Who would it have been promised to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo spoke a little earlier about doing things for mates and about pork-barrelling. He was talking about the people of the Illawarra getting a $12.5m building, the construction costs that would come with that which would then go into the local community to local contractors, and the multiplier effect that would follow from that. If they are my mates in Wollongong, then I am proud of it. I am pleased to know that they will get some work out of it. At present our construction industry is booming, and this will add to it over the coming 12 months under the approval process that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the 101-odd jobs, very few of which the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) said would actually come to Wollongong in the technical field, I agree with him. We have said that before. I have said that as a local member, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said that, and the local media have said it as well. But there will be some people, in the clerical areas and so on, who will not be prepared to move. Some of those positions will be created there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suspect that over time people will develop an infatuation and a love for the Illawarra like those of us who live there, and be prepared to move. It is cheaper to live there than in Sydney, and the environment is quite conducive to a healthy lifestyle. That has to be attractive. If 101 people move there and buy a house, that is not too bad. We need to remember the injection of the money that they earn in salaries. As I think the honourable member for North Sydney might have said on a previous occasion&mdash;or as somebody said&mdash;these are highly qualified and senior people who are therefore paid reasonably well. If they come to Wollongong, they can spend their money in Wollongong, and we will welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall appearing as the local member at the Public Works hearing in Wollongong to support the project there. As the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) said, the question was raised as to whether the decision was made for other than operational reasons. When I said that the answer was yes, I went on to qualify that by talking about things like economic and social benefits. I said that in many cases decisions taken by government to decentralise facilities out of central Sydney&mdash;which is in line, for example, as I said yesterday, with an economic strategy that has been developed for the Illawarra&mdash;is perfectly legitimate. If there is an additional economic cost associated with that, so be it. But the social consideration of a region which has slightly above the national average in unemployment&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Slightly, as I said, by comparison with some other areas of Australia. Yes, it is about 13.8 per cent compared with 11.4 per cent nationally. If that is the case, we will support that, and we will most certainly support it on those grounds. I think I said that at the Public Works Committee hearing in Wollongong, and I stand by that now. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a strategy of supporting decentralisation. There is always this view, with whichever government department it happens to be. If it is in Sydney and needs to be relocated, it goes to somewhere else in Sydney or to Melbourne, Adelaide or Brisbane. Yet major regional areas like the Illawarra, Newcastle in the Hunter region or Geelong, or some other parts of Australia, are pushed to one side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of these debates this afternoon on the Public Works Committee recommendations, I find it absolutely hypocritical that Opposition members are talking about the Government having taken the wrong options on Badgerys Creek and the airport in Brisbane by not spending enough money in the economically distressed area of the western suburbs of Sydney or around Brisbane. They are in here saying, `Spend more money because it will create more jobs in the western suburbs of Sydney'. But when we suggest we do that in a place like the Illawarra, the reaction is `Shock, horror!', `Pork-barrelling', `Doing it for your mates', and all the rest of it. It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a project that will be welcomed in the Illawarra region for the reasons I have outlined on many occasions in the past. To suggest that there was some particular conspiracy involving doing things for mates because there was a preselection contest on is absolute nonsense. The fact is that we have here a decision taken by government. It has been endorsed by a majority report, which I acknowledge, of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at the facts and figures, and the whinges, and the leaking of a document by some officer in the Hydrographic Office who does not want to go to Wollongong&mdash;and I am sure honourable members will agree that it is nothing more than that; that is exactly what it is all about. We can look at it objectively and see the basic economic difference after the revision Wollongong City Council was prepared to do in terms of the provision of car parking. The honourable member for North Sydney knows of the difficulties associated with whether or not an organisation is a Commonwealth entity, of getting Commonwealth governments to adhere to the Environment, Planning and Assessment Act in New South Wales and the conditions there laid down. If none of that is done, then the cost difference is absolutely minuscule. So to suggest that there is any other reason why this particular facility should not come to Wollongong, other than to support the economic base of the Illawarra, is certainly glossing over the real reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be welcomed in the Illawarra. As is always the case, the commitment of a Liberal Party to anything in the Illawarra was clearly demonstrated by the honourable member for Mayo when he said that if, by some strange quirk of fate, the Opposition becomes the government before this project starts, the Liberal Party will stop it. It is like anything else those opposite have ever done for the Illawarra; it amounts to absolutely nothing. I think the people of Wollongong will long remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only echo the sentiments of my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby. When we talk about political candidates and so on, as he said, the mob opposite cannot even get anybody to stand in the electorate of Throsby. They had to drag a publican out of his pub in north Wollongong to ask him to join the Liberal Party so he could stand against me. Thanks very much. We will have candidates of that quality any time. This proposal is worthy of support, and the Government certainly supports it. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works involves the construction of the York Park office at Barton in the Australian Capital Territory. The project comprises a four-storey building above ground level, and a lower ground floor and basement comprising two wings joined by a central core. The building will provide parking, storage and plant areas in the basement level under the southern wing; main entry and orientation space on the lower ground floor, with parking in the southern wing and storage workshop space in the northern wing; and general office accommodation on the ground, first, second and third floors. Associated site development works will comprise stormwater drainage, water and sewage reticulation and the construction of roads, car parks, associated footpaths and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in September 1992. The Committee has now tabled its report recommending the development at an estimated cost of $186.832m. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Administrative Services and the National Capital Planning Authority have noted the Committee's recommendations and have agreed to undertake an energy audit of the completed building one year after occupation; to continue consultations with the Conservation Council of the south-east region and Canberra and the National Trust of Australia&mdash;and seek the assistance of those bodies in developing a program to protect the day flying moth located in the York Park area and its habitat; provide the Committee with a copy of the completed botanical survey of the York Park area; and continue consultations with staff and staff associations during the design, development and construction of the York Park project and with the Public Sector Union and staff associations regarding options for the provision of child-care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The York Park office will replace existing unsatisfactory accommodation at the Administrative Building in Parkes, where the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and I once worked, which does not meet Commonwealth standards for office accommodation. The building is suffering from overcrowding and has pressing occupational health and safety problems, including inadequate fire safety provisions, unsafe electrical services and obsolete air-conditioning services. Basic building services are not overdue for upgrading to present day requirements and are expected to fail in the next two to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies undertaken during the feasibility stages of the project indicated that the York Park office project would be the most cost-effective and expedient solution to these pressing occupational health and safety problems. The project is also consistent with the Government's objective of providing cost-effective office space for departments to enhance operational efficiency and the delivery of government services. It provides a solid investment opportunity for the Commonwealth with a viable long term return on funds invested and represents the most effective use of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building's construction will also generate employment opportunities in Canberra and interstate by providing 750 person years of on-site work and a further 750 person years in manufacturing, fabrication and supplies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be opposing this blatant waste of money on the shift to York Park. The proposal before us has a long history of delays and incompetence very much associated with this Government. In 1986, the then Department of Housing and Construction was commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission to prepare a refurbishment master plan for the building. It was for a staged refurbishment plan over a number of years. At that time, staged refurbishment was regarded as the preferred option. In July 1987 Jackson and Swayn Pty Ltd, architects, were commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission to implement stage 1 of the refurbishment proposed in the Department of Housing and Construction report. The project did not go ahead. Jackson and Swayn produced a new report in December 1988. It recommended early action to deal with the problems in the Administrative Building and canvassed two options: firstly, the construction of a new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and secondly, the construction of one or two annexes to the Administrative Building which would be used to relocate people during the refurbishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1989, in consideration of the recommendations contained in the Jackson and Swayn report, DAS identified a number of suitable building sites and put a submission to the Government for a new building at the York Park site in Barton, which was reserved for major policy departments requiring proximity to Parliament House. At the request of government, DAS expanded on the option in a supplementary submission in 1990. The options considered by government in 1990 were: firstly, the construction of a large building which would allow the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to colocate from its existing five locations; secondly, the construction of a smaller building; and, thirdly, the construction of a less prestigious building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision taken in the 1990-91 Federal Budget was to allocate $4m for detailed design work&mdash;that $4m did not cover the enormous amount of money expended on different reports and different submissions up to that point, from 1986 right through until 1990&mdash;sufficient for referral to the Committee for the York Park building on the basis that it would provide general purpose office accommodation as a staging place for a number of tenants, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In 1991, Project Coordination Australia Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Australian Estate Management group for this particular purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is interesting to note that the building that the Department has proposed is for 46,300 square metres of net useable floor area. The present departments all up have 47,117 square metres of floor area. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at present occupies 41,117 square metres and Austrade some 5,900 square metres, bringing the total to some 47,000 square metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 46,000-square metre building at York Park will cost $187m. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), who is in the chamber, expressed his concerns today at the enormous cost, and so he should. I am pleased that he, too, is concerned about the cost. The $187m relates to a square metre building rate of $3,970 per square metre which is an excessive amount. It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) described this project as being a significant waste of money at a time when one million Australians do not have jobs, and when this sort of funding should not be allocated to what has aptly been described as `Gareth's Gazebo'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normal building costs in the commercial area for this sort of lavish building run at between $2,000 and $2,500 per square metre. In the Government's own report it was estimated that to build 14,000 square metres of new building, which my colleagues put down in the dissenting report, attached to the existing site would be $2,214 per square metre, which is about right. The Government is proposing to build a building that will cost just on $4,000 a square metre, whereas in its own report it estimated that to build 14,000 square metres as an annex to the existing site will cost only $2,214 per square metre. It is amazing how costs have been bandied around and manipulated to justify one's ends&mdash;to try, in some contrived way, to justify such an enormous waste of money on this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the early costings, which are contained in the 1988 master plan, we see that the construction of a new home to accommodate the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was only $1,622.48 per square metre. In the middle of a reccession, when building costs have been falling, we have had enormous cost jumps from $1,622 to $2,214, which is about right for a very substantial building&mdash;and, for a building in this case, of $3,970 per square metre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also contains a refurbishment cost of the existing building estimated to be worth $80m. Even the estimated cost to refurbish the existing building runs at a rate of $2,190 per square metre, whereas the Government's own report put the costing for the refurbishment previously contained in the report at $1,446.55 per square metre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow there has been a staggering cost increase just on the estimate for the refurbishment. The estimate in the proposal put forward to the Government was $80m, and $187m for the construction cost. An all-up expenditure of $267m has been proposed by this Government. As I mentioned earlier, the Government is proposing that sort of expenditure for no extra floor area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report went on to say that this work was desperately needed because the staff in the building were working in `cramped conditions' and needed extra accommodation. The new building is in fact marginally smaller than the present accommodation&mdash;but at a massively increased cost. It would seem that after all of this we have not achieved the original goal. We have spent an incredible amount of money on this development at a time when governments should be looking at sensible expenditure and not a blatant waste of money, as we have witnessed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a dissenting report brought down by my colleagues the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Paul Calvert, senator for Tasmania, they recommended that the existing building be refurbished and that an annex of 14,000 square metres be built. The all-up cost of that was estimated to be $102,624,000, which included the refurbishment of the existing building, a new 14,000-square metre building as an annex and additional car parking. I would have thought that that would have been a far more sensible way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously in this chamber I have raised the question of substantial costing discrepancies in regard to the development of Commonwealth Government offices. I think this one beats the lot of them. This is the grand dandy of all of them. To spend this sort of money, $3,970 per square metre, to construct such a lavish building would rival the spending on this Parliament House&mdash;and it would not meet the original requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now told that there is an urgent need because occupational health and safety issues must be considered. This all started in August 1989. It is amazing that the Minister and the Government have mucked around since that time right up until, magically, someone suggested, `Let's whack up this great building'&mdash;a monument to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and his Department, at enormous expense to the Australian taxpayer&mdash;`on the York Park site. Hang meeting the requirements of suitable accommodation. Let's forget about the fact that the original accommodation is cramped. Let's forget about the fact that we can achieve our aims at a far more affordable and realistic price'. For that reason, the coalition supports the Leader of the Opposition's description of this as a blatant waste of money and opposes the expenditure of these funds for this purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate on the York Park proposal representing in this chamber the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill. It is clear that the York Park solution in relation to the needs and requirements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for proper accommodation for its officials is not the most appropriate option to be pursued. There are various reasons for that. Many of them have been advanced in the dissenting report attached to the Public Works Committee document. Evidence has been adduced in relation to that. Another reason, which worries me more, is the political imperatives operating at this time. It is clear that proposals for a separate building for the Department of Foreign Affairs have been afoot for a long time. It is only this year that those proposals have got up. Previously the Government accepted the advice that a proposal of this sort was extravagant and, in the worst recession in 60 years, an inappropriate option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that this proposal is being spoken of as one which will create employment opportunities in Canberra. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has commented that approximately 750 jobs would be created over three years as a result of the Government's decision to construct a new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Yet Canberra has one of the lowest rates of unemployment for its community of any part of Australia. If we look at the impact of the recession and the requirement to generate jobs through construction, we see that the priorities are anywhere but Canberra. If we look at the profile of the unemployed in Canberra in need of work, we will see that they are not seeking employment in construction projects. The people who are very often involved in construction projects are brought into Canberra to enable that work to proceed, and the recruitment is undertaken well away from here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember the advice I used to receive from the former member for Lilley in relation to the sorts of public works and expenditures that governments ought to be involved in during periods of recession. The late Kevin Cairns made it very clear that if we are looking at the long term economic advantages for Australia as a result of public works expenditure&mdash;induced expenditure to create job opportunities&mdash;we are looking at major infrastructure developments that will improve our economic capacity. In other words, if the Government were serious about addressing Australia's long term problems and it had hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, it would not be looking at upgrading office accommodation when it could improve roads and ports and railways, which might enhance our economic capacity as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government put some weight on those factors in relation to the expenditure that it has planned for local government. In my community I have had to explain why local councils in our district will not receive any local government funding from this Government when we have an unemployment rate approaching 5 and 6 per cent, comparable with the numbers in Canberra. The basis upon which my electorate, and many electorates such as mine, are excluded from the opportunity to participate in local government programs is that the unemployment levels in our districts are correspondingly lower and, therefore, the need does not exist. That is an argument that is put, fearlessly, in relation to districts such as the Shire of Hornsby, the Shire of Baulkham Hills, the Municipality of Ryde and others in the northern areas of Sydney. Yet when it comes to Canberra there is a different psyche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are interesting coalitions involved in this exercise. The Department of the Treasury would normally counsel prudence in these matters. What do we find? Treasury sees the prospect of being able to move from shared accommodation with the Department of Finance and others to a refurbished kremlin&mdash;as I am told the old Foreign Affairs building has been affectionately known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of opposition that one would expect quietly disappears in the context of doing a deal so that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gets its new building. One would expect that Treasury would have counselled carefully against a development of this sort in the context of the wider economic arguments and the recession that we are dealing with. Here we have one of the most extravagant buildings planned for Canberra at a time of enormous difficulty for the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one compares the size of this proposal with other major buildings here in Canberra, this building, to be erected for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will have 47,000 square metres of space. The MLC tower has 20,000 square metres, so this proposal is more than double its total accommodation. The Advance Bank in Civic has 15,000 square metres, so this proposal is more than three times its size. Another interesting fact in relation to this development is contained in the minority report of the Public Works Committee. It becomes clear that when one compares the available space in the existing building and the work that needs to be undertaken in it&mdash;that is, as distinct from other issues of amenities, corridors and so on&mdash;there will be very little difference in the available working area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have to ask themselves why they put together a proposal that involves at least $80m more than the estimated cost of other proposed solutions, such as adding an annex to the existing administrative building&mdash;the kremlin&mdash;as well as the further $80m that will be required to refurbish the administrative building after it is vacated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when its new building is erected. We have a total additional cost of $160m for very little advantage in comparison to the alternative cost-effective proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of all that evidence, we have to ask why this very large amount of money needs to be spent in Canberra at a time when one of the Commonwealth's own agencies is vacating a major building that it has occupied in Canberra for alternative premises in Melbourne; that is, the CSIRO. The point is that we have other premises presently occupied but which will be vacated by a Commonwealth agency and which, as I understand it, the agency cannot sell. All of that is occurring during the worst recession in over 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priorities are distorted in the extreme. Is it any wonder that the Opposition takes the very strong view that the building, which has been affectionately labelled already as the Gareth Mahal, does not find support from Her Majesty's Opposition? Our position has been made very clear. I worry greatly when I find what appears to be cosy deals being undertaken by the Labor Party in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> states that the ACT Chief Minister&mdash;also in the Labor Party&mdash;had ordered her bureaucrats to ensure that all of the arrangements around the development of this particular proposal be facilitated by the end of this year so that the contracts in relation to this construction can be signed before any election. The cynicism of that would be extraordinarily disappointing to most Australians. These deals are being done between the Labor Party locally and nationally to get this particular development afoot so that the cost of being able to bring the development to an end is such that it is unlikely that that would occur. When Australians elsewhere are suffering so much, it is beyond my comprehension why this Government would seriously contemplate that approach. The Opposition will vigorously oppose this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to elaborate briefly on the reasons why I, together with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Paul Calvert from Tasmania, dissented from the majority view of the Public Works Committee. The nub of it has already been brought out both by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock).<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic reason is that this whole York Park proposal fails on the majority report itself, simply because that report does not substantiate the need for the expenditure of $187m as the most cost-effective solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Dundas very succinctly said, there are a number of other issues&mdash;whether they be refurbishments, additions or annexes to existing buildings&mdash;that are not explored in sufficient detail within the body of the report. No matter which way one looks at it, we are not dealing simply with $187m today; we are dealing with at least $100m more than that simply because those refurbishments&mdash;whether they be to the administrative building, the Treasury building or whatever&mdash;will go ahead in due course anyhow. We are dealing not simply with $187m but with a substantial amount over and above that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point&mdash;and it is something that the honourable member for Forrest brought out&mdash;is in terms of occupational health and safety. He made a very valid point that those occupational health and safety matters were known to this Government five or six years ago. Suddenly, it has become the major issue, something that will take a number of years to correct. So, it is not something that I think the Government can really hang its hat on in terms of proving to this Parliament that, in fact, the York Park proposal is the most cost-effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of jobs, as the honourable member for Dundas has said, those jobs predominantly will go outside the ACT region. There is no doubt about that. A lot of those jobs will not be generated and, in an area where unemployment is below the national average, it seems ludicrous to me that this Government should be spending $187m that could be better spent somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter which nobody has raised so far, but which is in the body of the dissenting report, is the ability of private enterprise to compete in designing a building that would suit the requirements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Australian Estate Management and Australian Construction Services have been involved in this proposal and, as a result, have come up with a proposal that will cost an amount approaching $187m. I would say to the House that there is a lot of experience around that would indicate that private enterprise, were it given the opportunity, could come up with a building still to suit the DFAT requirements at substantially less than a cost of $187 million, if indeed the York Park option were to be the optimum one. In my view and in the dissenting view, that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that we are dealing here with a Taj Mahal or, if one were to be cynical, a Gareth Mahal in terms of the York Park proposal. I think that it behoves everybody in this place on both sides to look very objectively at what is before us and to vote accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In finishing my comments in this debate, I would draw on some comments made in debates about some of the earlier notices relating to the Public Works Committee. I would like to take the opportunity, because I did not yesterday, in terms of the tabling debate, to pay tribute to the Public Works Committee secretariat and to the great work that they have done over calendar year 1992 but, in particular, over the last three or four months. This Government has placed a very large load on the PWC and I would like to think that the members of the Committee have come to the party and recommended quite quickly to this Parliament, as was said yesterday, of the order of $750m worth of capital expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) has left the House. That is unfortunate. It is probably my last opportunity in this place to pay tribute to both the honourable member for Greenway and the honourable member for for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who will not be continuing as members of the Public Works Committee in the next Parliament. I have to say to the House&mdash;and I am sure I speak for all of my colleagues on both sides of the House&mdash;that Mutt and Jeff, as we call them in the Public Works Committee, are two gentleman whom we in that Committee will miss in the next Parliament, if indeed we are members of that Committee in the next Parliament. I think that all members in this Parliament would share those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As he said earlier in this debate and in earlier debates, he has exercised a very large degree of bipartisanship as the Chairman of that Committee. It is a very bipartisan committee. It is unfortunate that the last two reports of that Committee to this House have expressed minority views upon which we will divide. Nevertheless, I think that a large measure of that, in fact, goes back&mdash;and I put it squarely at the feet of the present Government in terms of the Hydrographic Office&mdash;to a blatant political move.

<PARA>The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Tapestry kits are free of customs duty while other needlecraft kits are dutiable at 15 per cent. Both types of kit are designed for needlework hobbyists. As such, they compete with, and are direct substitutes for, each other. </PARA>

In addition, this situation has been further aggravated by a recent Federal Court decision. As a result of this decision, many kits not considered by the industry to be tapestry kits are now legally defined as such. As there is no local manufacture of these kits, the Government has decided to dispense with the tariff advantage enjoyed by tapestry kits by providing a free rate of duty for all kits of heading 6308. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 323, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing people in the Australian Public Service: dilemmas of devolution and diversity</EMPHASIS>, is the result of the Committee's inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of human resource management in the Australian Public Service. The Committee's purpose in conducting the inquiry was to assess the impact of recent reforms in the management of the Public Service. These reforms included the abolition in 1987 of the Public Service Board as the central human resource management agency for the Australian Public Service, the creation of the Public Service Commission as its successor, and the decentralisation and devolution of its functions to a number of other coordinating agencies and line departments. The report identifies the need for further reform in certain key areas of human resource management in order to restore fundamental Public Service values and ethics in a climate characterised by an increasing emphasis on achieving efficiency in purely economic terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn, firstly, to the area of decentralisation. The Committee has found that the current decentralised arrangement of functions which involves the Public Service Commission, the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment, Education and Training is failing to provide for effective management of people in the Australian Public Service. The decentralised arrangement has, in our view, resulted in a loss of consistency, equity and Service-wide perspective. For this reason, the Committee has recommended, in a major shake-up, that the management of the Australian Public Service be re-centralised into one single body: the Public Service Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the Commission's new role, the Committee has also recommended that the Commission be restructured and that appropriate resources be allocated to it. In the area of devolution, the Committee found in its inquiry that devolution of many management responsibilities to departments has also contributed to a loss of consistency and equity. While we recognise that a balance is required between central controls and devolved responsibility, we have made a number of recommendations to address issues which have suffered&mdash;in particular, issues such as equal employment opportunity. </PARA>

He cannot contribute to anything: he has to tear something down. Regarding the human resources report of the Public Accounts Committee, I refer to the issue of broadening the range of policy advice to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major focus of the inquiry was to look at the current narrow, predominantly exclusively economic, range of policy advice which is offered to government. The Committee found that amongst the current departmental secretaries and amongst the majority of officers in the Senior Executive Service a higher proportion have narrow backgrounds which are dominated by an economic approach to management. While recognising the need for balance, the Committee has emphasised that economic rationalism must not be the sole driving ideological force behind change and improvements to efficiency. Accordingly, we have made a number of recommendations designed to broaden the range of policy advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On other issues, the report addresses a number of matters. They include: recruitment and selection processes; access to more flexible forms of employment, such as permanent part time work; performance appraisal mechanisms for all staff; the placement of surplus staff; and training and development opportunities for staff, including the establishment of closer links with educational institutions. The report also recognises some reservations about performance pay and, whilst recognising some of the potential benefits of workplace bargaining, has also expressed some concerns about its impact on the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to my Committee colleagues, both near and far. Senator Pat Giles, whilst performing her duties at the United Nations in New York, has found time to contribute her ideas to this report. I also thank the secretariat staff&mdash;Sue Morton, Sameer Chopra and Yolanda Campagna&mdash;for their efforts to produce the Committee's report in such a timely manner. I thank my fellow members of the Committee and in particular the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) who has put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to report 324, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth support for private sector investment in research and development</EMPHASIS>. Committee report 324 examines support that government provides for research by the private sector and private sector development and commercialisation of research. It is the second volume of the Committee's report on its inquiry into research and development. The first volume covered research and development by public sector research organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry resulted from a concern that Australia did not have a good record of commercialising its research, in spite of high levels of government expenditure on R&amp;D and an excellent international reputation for its research performance. In addition, the level of investment in R&amp;D by the private sector in Australia was known to be one of the lowest of the OECD countries. The Committee resolved to examine the reasons for this situation and the extent to which the Government's programs are effective in stimulating private sector performance of R&amp;D and, importantly, its commercialisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee identified two important factors that affect the private sector's success in commercialising research. The first is the need for capital to finance research, development and particularly the commercialisation phase of the process. Large Australian firms have access to capital but the situation facing small and medium sized firms is difficult. The second factor is the generally small size of Australian firms. They tend to lack the range of expertise and contacts needed to commercialise their products effectively, especially overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finance for research and development and commercialisation was one issue which preoccupied the Committee. The 150 per cent tax concession for R&amp;D, which was introduced in 1985, appears to have produced a considerable increase in business investment in R&amp;D. The Committee fully supports the Government's initiative in the last Budget to extend the tax concession indefinitely and so encourage a continued commitment of corporate funds to R&amp;D, and has recommended a number of improvements to the concession and its administration. For example: it should be extended to costs associated with market analysis and the development of market entry strategies; the interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be clarified so that pilot plant and equipment and research conducted either overseas or by multinationals in Australia can be more easily claimed as concessions; anomalies that hinder the transfer of intellectual property during commercialisation should be removed; and encouragement should be given to genuine syndicates and collaborative ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Committee considered possible means of making more capital available for R&amp;D and its commercialisation. Significantly, the Committee has rejected, for the time being, the idea of compelling superannuation funds to invest a certain proportion of their funds&mdash;their RD&amp;C, research, development and commercialisation&mdash;and has called for clarification of the `prudent man rule' to remove any impediments to investment in RD&amp;C. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee endorses the call by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for superannuation funds to report more fully on their investments in different classes of assets, including development and venture capital. These reports should be made public through a report from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to the Parliament. There are other ways of stimulating the availability of capital, such as tax exempt savings accounts and modifying the requirements for investing in pooled development funds. These points were the subject of recommendations, as was the need for the Australian Technology Group to focus its funding on selected industries and on joint ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the aspect of growing Australian companies. Successfully exploiting research is much more easily achieved by larger organisations than smaller ones. Helping firms to get larger is therefore an important objective in promoting the commercialisation of research. I have already mentioned the Committee's recommendations on supporting joint ventures through tax and capital measures. Another way in which companies can grow is through networking and forming strategic alliances. The Committee strongly supports the existing government programs that promote networking and recommends their extension. The Australian Technology Group could also play a significant role in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to management and marketing skills. Not only are many firms disadvantaged by their small size; some of the smaller ones also lack management and marketing expertise. Programs such as the national industry extension service make a valuable contribution in providing training in management and marketing skills. Such programs should receive additional funding, and grants to firms for R&amp;D should be made conditional upon the firms receiving help with management and marketing if these appear to be necessary for the successful commercialisation of the R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to government programs supporting private sector investment in R&amp;D, the Committee believes that the existing programs adequately cover the range of activities involved in transforming research into saleable products. A number of problems common to several programs were identified by the Committee: firstly, there is rather little information available about the relative effectiveness of different forms of support for R&amp;D, and research is needed to establish what is the best approach for the Government to take; secondly, there are a confusing number and variety of programs run by different agencies&mdash;a single source of information about them should be available and they should be monitored and coordinated; and, thirdly, unsuccessful applicants for R&amp;D grants do not always receive feedback on their lack of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee examined a number of individual programs dealing with offsets and intellectual property and recommended evaluations in both of these areas. The Committee also noted the criticism levelled by the Industry Commission at the national procurement development program. We acknowledge that this program has experienced problems but believe that its role in providing an opportunity to firms to link with large government customers to trial and demonstrate technological developments is vital in establishing the credibility of these new technologies to other potential customers. The Committee believes that there is a strong case for maintaining the national procurement development program or a similar scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Research and Development Board is responsible for many of the Government's programs assisting private sector RD&amp;C. The Committee believes that the board plays an important role in this respect, but that it should be strengthened. The Committee recommends that the board be reviewed and its mission and the objectives of its programs clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee supports the view that government agencies charged with assisting R&amp;D should support areas in which Australia has a competitive advantage. They should also tailor the assistance provided to the specific needs of firms and industries. This should be carried out within the context of national production and export goals set as a result of extensive community consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to give my very great thanks to the staff of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly Sarah Hnatiuk, who worked very hard on this report, and before her Miss Fiona Taylor who did likewise. I would like to thank all members of the Committee, particularly the subcommittee, who worked tirelessly on this report, but it would be wrong of me not to single out for particular mention the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), both of whom did an enormous amount of work in this regard. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government has reconsidered its position in relation to whether equipment royalties should be grandfathered when they are paid or credited to a non-resident pursuant to a contract entered into prior to the Budget announcement by the Government of its intention to introduce a final withholding tax for royalties. The arrangements that some companies have entered into with payments to aircraft lessors through a tax haven are exactly the type of structure that the royalty withholding tax was intended to combat. There is no doubt that tax avoidance through offshore leasing abuses has been shown by the lobbying that has occurred since the Budget to be even larger than the Government had identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is not in the game of countenancing tax avoidance. However, the new arrangements would cause considerable additional cost to companies that have gross-up clauses in their contracts, as they would have to pay the withholding tax on behalf of the recipient. The Government has therefore concluded that there is a case for grandfathering equipment royalties when they were paid or credited under the terms of the contract entered into before Budget night. The Government cannot agree to the Opposition's proposal to extend grandfathering provisions into contracts entered into after the Budget announcement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition welcomes the Government's change of mind in this connection. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) did provide for retrospectively imposing an obligation to taxation pursuant to certain commercial leases involving equipment and non-residents. Essentially we proposed, in an amendment to the Senate, that transitional arrangements be put in place, intended to ameliorate the retrospective elements in the Bill, as we see them. Naturally, we do have some other concerns, which are not entirely addressed by any of these amendments. I want to point out that the provisions do have the effect of applying unfairly to existing equipment leases with non-residents. We join the Government in trying to combat tax avoidance, and the intent of the Bill of course draws no objections from us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we can come to grips with tax avoidance in different ways, but innocent people who have not been practising tax minimisation or avoidance can also be trapped. Those innocent people can be unfairly hurt. The tax could have resulted in the demise or the severe financial distress of some taxpayers, with the obvious and inevitable effects on employment. As it stands, Australian residents often carry the tax under these proposals because it is common for royalty agreements to pass the burden for such taxes to the Australian buyer. It was not only non-residents, in effect, that could have been snared&mdash;or will be&mdash;under obligation to pay tax in the future. The effective rate of tax, I might add, is up to 43 per cent under current Tax Office grossing-up rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments as a whole incorrectly assume that large profits are derived on equipment leases which currently escape Australian tax. I heard the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) indicate some surprise, and judged an estimate that there was widespread tax avoidance on the basis of the people who lobbied him&mdash;and particularly the numbers, I think I heard him say. That is an indication of people's interest, but it does not necessarily mean that there is any untoward tax minimisation or tax avoidance being practised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite claims to the contrary, these amendments are inconsistent with overseas practice on equipment leasing too. They seem to be terribly inconsistent with the move towards self-assessment in the taxation area generally. By moving amendments in the Senate which caused the Government to reconsider and to come out with this albeit different commencement date, we at least gave the equipment leasing industry the opportunity of consultation which it did not have prior to us doing so. So what we proposed were reasonable transitional provisions. In the amendment which has been altered and is now before the Committee, we propose that the relevant provisions commence on the day the Bill passed the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any terrible difficulty with what is now proposed and simply note that we claim the credit for forcing the Government to reconsider.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than a lot. The context of what we have been doing here in the last couple of days and our experience through the life of the Parliament with taxation laws indicates that original legislation goes through this place, more often than not, under the guillotine, thereby preventing any sort of sensible sort of discussion or debate. It goes on to the Senate, and eventually the amendments come back into this place in the form we have tonight. This is a classic example of it, where we need 11 pages now to amend legislation which went through this House without a murmur simply because debate was not allowed on it. I even believe the honourable gentlemen opposite accept that that is a crazy way to legislate; it certainly does not add anything to our understanding of tax law. But more importantly, for those who practise in the area and those who have to honour obligations and pay tax as a result of these laws, I think we should have a much better record of getting it right in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This Bill will make amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to ensure that all persons working in the offshore petroleum industry in Commonwealth waters are protected by occupational health and safety legislation. Currently persons working in the industry offshore Western Australia and Queensland are not covered by occupational health and safety provisions. The Bill rectifies that situation. However, the provisions of the Bill will cease to apply once the relevant States move to extend the coverage of their occupational health and safety legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occupational health and safety provisions in the Bill reflect similar provisions found in most State legislation and closely follow those in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. The occupational health and safety provisions in the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act are modelled on existing State/Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill places a general duty of care on employers and employees alike to protect the health and safety of all those working in the offshore petroleum industry. It provides a framework within which employers and employees may cooperate to address health and safety issues in the workplace. The amendments will provide a framework at the workplace for the selection of employee health and safety representatives and the establishment of health and safety committees with employer and employee representation to facilitate cooperation in the protection of the health and safety of employees at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards on specific hazards may be included in regulations and codes of practice may be approved by the designated authority for the relevant adjacent area to give guidance to the industry on meeting obligations made by the occupational health and safety provisions. The provisions will be administered by the designated authority for the relevant adjacent area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indisputable that there is a need for a framework within which employers and employees cooperate to protect the health and safety of all those working in a potentially hazardous industry such as the offshore petroleum industry. The need was heightened by the major disaster which occurred on the Piper Alpha production platform in the UK sector of the North Sea in 1988. Regrettably, in that instance, 167 lives were lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has responded comprehensively to this disaster and set up the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum Industry, COSOP. COSOP, consisting of State and Commonwealth Government, union and industry representatives, was charged with assessing the findings from the UK inquiries and advising the Government on the future direction of offshore safety in Australia. COSOP's principal recommendations were:</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the adoption of the safety case approach to offshore safety, together with the progressive introduction of objective setting regulations to replace prescriptive requirements wherever possible;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the extension of occupational health and safety coverage, based on the relevant provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, to those offshore areas where no occupational health and safety provisions currently apply;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the establishment of a single point of contact and responsibility for offshore occupational health and safety matters in each State or Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the adequate resourcing and training of authorities to enable them to effectively administer the new regime; and</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the establishment of a national incident data base. </PARA>
<PARA>These recommendations have been accepted by the Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory governments, the petroleum industry and the unions. The first element, the adoption of the `safety case' approach to offshore safety, is already being implemented. Companies operating in Australian waters are now required by the offshore petroleum legislation to prepare safety cases for all platforms and floating production facilities for which either design commences or which commence operating after 1 July this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is considering a Bill for an Act to amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to promote the occupational health and safety of persons employed in the designated areas, and for related purposes. As simple as that title might seem, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill is duplicating complex legislation, and it is an unnecessary addition at this time when the Western Australian State Parliament is on the verge of acting in relation to these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the stated position of the coalition in the Senate, the Opposition is opposed to this legislation. In reaching that conclusion, it does not for one moment take away from the commitment of the coalition to occupational health and safety. It is how best that is delivered in the legislative framework in an area where there is certainly a Federal role in passing and a more significant Federal role in relation to other areas of jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular matter which has been brought to our attention relates to the fact that the Bill deals with both Western Australia and Queensland. Effectively there is no activity in Queensland which would be picked up by the legislation as things stand. As I have mentioned already, there is legislation in Western Australia and, according to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his second reading speech, this aspect of the legislation will trip out the moment the Western Australian Parliament does so legislate. That means that we have another 45-page piece of drafting working its way through the Federal Parliament. It was meant to be introduced at 2.00 a.m. last night; it has now come on at the more civilised hour&mdash;dare I say&mdash;of 8.30 tonight. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), who is sitting at the table, previously indicated an approximate cost for putting a Bill through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One million dollars for legislating. There is a lot of existing regulation applying on this occupational health and safety front. We cannot put a price on life; we must accept the full safety element. A term utilised by the Government in another area of its operation&mdash;namely, aviation&mdash;is `affordable safety'. Absolute minimum standards are required in quite dangerous work involving the offshore rigs which this Bill may cover for a period of 10 days. By the time it is actually gazetted, it could well be that this massive Commonwealth legislative process will be in operation for as little as 10 days before it trips out and is handled by the Western Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of relevance is the fact that there was little consultation with industry. I have a copy of a letter sent by the Executive Director of APEA, Mr Dick Wells, to the Minister for Resources, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing of the request from the Department for comments on the draft Bill does not allow for detailed analysis . . . However, after preliminary reviews of the draft Bill APEA member companies would like to request that it not proceed to legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All offshore petroleum operators in Australia have in place effective systems to promote OH&amp;S to employees and contractors. These systems include employee representation, OH&amp;S committees, investigation and reporting of accidents and OH&amp;S training. Western Australian operators. . . are covered onshore by the State Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Act 1987, administered by the DOHSWA. The companies strongly support the extension of the approach embodied in that Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Western Australian Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to offshore adjacent areas. Specific areas of difference to the proposed Commonwealth legislation are designated work groups and health and safety representatives provisional improvement notices. The arrangements proposed for health and safety representatives are inappropriate for multiple-union small work force situations. The result will be multiple work groups each with their own representative having major powers of investigation and the ability to order work to stop. A single health and safety representative should be appointed by and answerable to a single Health and Safety Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>APEA made several other points relevant to its recommendation that this is not the right course of action at this time&mdash;not the least of which being that the legislation is unnecessary and may never become operational. APEA commented that the legislation will create duplication and conflict regarding the notification and reporting of accidents, especially under `current Directions clauses 280-287 and the draft Bill clauses 68-69'. The draft Bill clauses were adjusted, and the Bill before the House has already passed through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For once, the Parliament should pause and think about what it is doing in respect of this legislation. A great deal of effort is required to ensure that the occupational health and safety standards are fully maintained across the Commonwealth. That requires a good deal of voluntary cooperation. We cannot legislate against someone taking dangerous action on an oil rig&mdash;for example, not wearing a safety helmet, harness, or glasses, or life jackets in certain loading and unloading circumstances, even though it is prescribed by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation in relation to seat beats is a classic example. It is now the legislation of the land that seat belts be worn at all times. Yet at times police find that high percentages of people are not responding to that legislated approach for sensible road safety&mdash;that is, the wearing of seat belts at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot guarantee enhanced safety by legislation. Legislation should presumably help to enhance safety, but we cannot guarantee it. It takes a combination of effort and occupational health and safety to bring abount the correct conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not meet the standard required by the coalition for a sensible approach to this important policy area. For the reasons I have outlined, the coalition is opposed to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill. We believe that the Government should go away and ask its Western Australian Labor colleagues, somewhat distracted as they might well be, to speed up this legislative approach. On the Minister's own admission if this process were sped up then this section of the legislation relating to offshore Western Australia would be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the slight improvement in the legislation before the House, for these and related reasons, the coalition continues its stated opposition to the legislation.

<PARA>Following the challenge to the decision to exclude from Australia non-Australian members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club, there has been close scrutiny of the decision-making regime for the exclusion of persons of bad character and of persons generally who may represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it. This Bill represents the results of that process and enables the Minister to exclude from Australia persons of bad character and other undesirable persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that, from the dates of commencement, certain decisions under the Migration Act will be subject to determinative merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The commencement dates take account of the fact that some provisions in the Bill apply to the Migration Act in its current form and others will apply only to provisions introduced into the Act by the Migration Reform Bill which are scheduled to come into operation on 1 November 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides the Minister or his or her delegate with the power to refuse or cancel a visa or entry permit where a person fails to meet the character criteria set out in the Act. There is also a power for the Minister, acting personally, to refuse or cancel visas or entry permits where, on the basis of information available to the Minister, he or she is satisfied that a person, if permitted to enter or remain in Australia, would be likely to engage in criminal conduct, would represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it, would engage in vilification of a segment of the community or would foment discord in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power is intended to be exercised in a manner consistent with well-accepted Australian values, such that it is aimed at those persons who may regard entry to this country as a means to attack those values. The new provisions would not be used to breach established standards of industrial democracy, for example. The provisions will also not impact on the continued implementation of current Government policy in relation to criminal deportation. That policy has been effective since May 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was updated in December 1988 when the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs clarified certain important issues for the benefit and guidance of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. While it is open and will remain open to the Government to change that policy from time to time in order to maintain its effectiveness and to give appropriate direction to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, apart from re-stating it and revising and updating the policy to take account of the legislative changes, there is no need at present to make any major changes now. A statement of the amended policy is tabled in conjunction with this amending legislation. This will ensure the currency of Government policy on criminal deportation and provide up-to-date guidance to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future, this Bill will provide a basis in the primary legislation for refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits on the grounds of character. It remains open to prescribe criteria relating to character in the migration regulations, but this would occur only in exceptional circumstances. Under this Bill, the Minister will be able to consider whether a person is of good character by reference to a person's actual criminal conduct, his or her general conduct, or by reference to a person's association with any other person, group or organisation who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct. Policy guidance will be developed in due course to assist those decision makers delegated with the power to make decisions under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All decisions taken under the powers provided for in this legislation will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Specifically, the decisions which will be subject to such review will be criminal deportations, decisions to refuse a visa or entry permit, decisions to cancel a visa or entry permit on the grounds of bad character, or where a person may engage in criminal conduct, vilify a segment of the community, foment discord in the community or represent a danger to the community. These decisions will be subject to such review from the date of royal assent to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be special arrangements for protection visas under provisions introduced by the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992. Protection visas will be granted on the basis that the applicant is entitled to protection under the United Nations convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees. Decisions to refuse protection visas will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where adverse determinations are made against persons such that character concerns are sufficiently serious to engage those articles of the convention which provide for the exclusion of an individual from the provisions of the convention, article 1F, or for the expulsion of a refugee, articles 32 and 33(2). Such decisions will only be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on and after 1 November 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the exercise of the new powers provided by this Bill will not be permitted; however, the Minister, acting personally, may decide that it is in the national interest that such persons not be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. In such cases the Minister will be required to include, as part of the decision, a certificate stating that, in the national interest, the person is refused entry to or permission to remain in the country. In those cases where a certificate is included, the Minister will be required to table a notice of the decision in the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the taking of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing for determinative review of these cases by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will mean that it is the sole merits review body for criminal deportation decisions, decisions refusing or cancelling visas or entry permits under the new character provisions, including decisions made relying on those articles of the refugee convention which allow for exclusion or expulsion of individuals and those decisions taken on the basis of information which satisfies the Minister that a person would vilify, incite discord or represent a danger to the Australian community or segment of it or would be likely to engage in criminal conduct in Australia. In these cases, the Immigration Review Tribunal, the new Refugee Review Tribunal created under the Migration Reform Bill, and internal departmental review officers will have no jurisdiction whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of clarity, any visa or entry permit refusal or cancellation involving the exercise of the powers provided for in this Bill will only be reviewable on the merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal, in reviewing such matters will be guided by relevant policy directives of the Government, such as the criminal deportation policy and that developed to guide the use of the powers provided for in this legislation. In such cases, this Tribunal will also then review all other aspects of the decision. Review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will only be permitted to a person whose visa or entry permit has been refused or cancelled if he or she is present in Australia at the time of the decision. If the person is not present, the Bill provides for that person's nominator or sponsor in Australia, if any, to take the matter before the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if a person has his or her visa or entry permit refused or cancelled, the person will be excluded from Australia for a period set out in the migration regulations. This will mean that, prior to 1 November 1993, those persons in Australia whose entry permits are cancelled because of these provisions will not be permitted, after being deported, to re-enter Australia for the period set out in the regulations. After that date, criminal deportees, who will continue to be subject to deportation, and persons in Australia whose visas are cancelled and who are thus liable to detention and removal from Australia as unlawful non-citizens will be similarly prevented from re-entering Australia for a period set out in the regulations. Persons who have not entered Australia will not be permitted to enter Australia for the period prescribed in the regulations. The regulations will be able to set out variable exclusion periods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a rare opportunity to be able to respond immediately after a second reading speech and not have to give some indication as to the nature of the Bill that we are discussing&mdash;in this case, the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992. No doubt, after my comments on this occasion everybody will be quite familiar with the matters that are being addressed as a result of the observations made by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). I want to put these matters into context. We do support the Bill. We regard it as an important Bill. I think it is incumbent on me to make clear why these matters are being addressed in this way at this time. As I understand it, we are putting into law as an Act of parliament the provision to deal with the character issues that are presently covered by regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the Bill arises in part from the challenge to the decision of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to exclude from Australia members of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club. It may be recalled that the Minister formed a view&mdash;and I think it was a proper view, on information available to him&mdash;that these people should be excluded from entry to Australia on character grounds. As a result of the Minister's decision, there was a challenge to a single judge of the Federal Court. He was minded to allow entry of representatives of the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club for their run, as I am told it is called. The matter was taken on appeal to the Full Court and the exclusion by the Minister was found to be lawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a number of serious issues were raised in that challenge, such that it was thought appropriate to put the matter beyond doubt. This legislation seeks to put beyond doubt the question as to Australia's entitlement to exclude people who have been convicted of significant criminal offences in their home country, or in another country before they have come to Australia, and also to ensure that people who may be convicted of serious offences here in Australia or who have failed to disclose serious offences before they obtained admission to Australia&mdash;and fraud may be involved&mdash;could be removed from Australia after entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be thought that character issues sometimes are matters that are taken up by the Minister and me on a fairly emotive basis and that these things ought not to be given as much profile as they are, but there have been a number of serious questions raised about character issues recently. Not in every case can the matters be addressed under the precise form of this legislation, but I want to put some of them clearly before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people ask the question&mdash;properly, I think&mdash;as to how certain people were able to enter Australia and then commit the murder of a very distinguished Australian, Dr Victor Chang. When we recognise the horror of that event and the fact that it occurred in this country and involved people who were not Australians but were here temporarily, the importance of character as a basis for determining people's entry can be well understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is proper to ensure that people who are coming to settle in Australia permanently are the subject of full and appropriate inquiries to establish their bona fides. People who have been convicted of serious criminal offences ought not to be able to enter Australia and settle permanently. But ought a Minister not be able to properly take into account a person's predilection to engage in criminal activities which may not be known by an offence in Australia but which may well be known to overseas agencies in relation to the admission of such a person to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intelligence information from international agencies is a very important aspect of character checking. This Bill provides a schema which recognises that that is information which may be known to government but which, if it became more broadly known and was the subject of challenges under our administrative law regime in a public forum&mdash;which we have discussed in other contexts recently&mdash;may well put at risk the very ability of Australia to obtain such information from overseas authorities. This situation could occur particularly where decisions in relation to entry are being challenged. The schema that we have here is one under which, in circumstances where one is relying upon intelligence information, it is the Minister who will form a judgment and it is the Minister who will be able to issue a conclusive certificate in order that he can properly protect the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise the importance of this schema and  the responsibility that the Minister is being asked to assume under this legislation. The scheme is unusual but it is appropriate. It was appropriate in the Hell's Angels Motor Cycle Club situation, for reasons better known to the Minister than to myself but for reasons that I understand. In relation to the Chang case, we were dealing with temporary entrants. One would hope that intelligence information could be used to try to protect Australia from situations such as that. It is a matter which Australians are very much aware of and concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise one other matter which I think concerns the electorate of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who will follow me in this debate. Recently, some very unfortunate events occurred in the suburb of Cabramatta. A young man was killed as a result of a very savage bashing. I do not believe the people who were responsible for that event have been apprehended; we may not know who they are. One of the honourable member's State colleagues has offered a view that, if the people involved happen to be non-citizens, certain action ought to be taken in relation to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister referred to a schema in relation to people who are non-citizens&mdash;that is, people who are permanent residents but have not taken out Australian citizenship. If those non-citizens have committed serious offences in Australia they may be liable to deportation. These serious offences involve the production, importation and distribution of and trafficking or commercial dealing in hard drugs; organised criminal activity; serious sexual assaults; armed robbery; violence against the person; terrorist activity and assassination; and kidnapping, blackmail and extortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the people who committed the event in which this young man died&mdash;which was violence against the person&mdash;were ascertained to be non-citizens and convicted, then that would lead to criminal deportation. We had a very dramatic call by the State member for Cabramatta, Mr Newman, for deportation of&mdash;in his words&mdash;non-nationalised Asian immigrants involved in the gang violence. I do not know who was involved in this violent activity but I am horrified at what happened and the circumstances in which it arose. If they are non-citizens, then to me criminal deportation seems a proper outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that, with the very high take-up of Australian citizenship amongst immigrants&mdash;particularly people from Indo-China&mdash;if the people involved in this action were from Indo-China then it would be very likely that deportation would not be a remedy because they would be Australian citizens. The take-up rate amongst the Indo-Chinese for Australian citizenship is about 95 per cent&mdash;very worth while, but very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years as the period of qualification to ascertain whether a person has a proclivity to commit serious criminal acts in Australia is a very short period. That is one reason why the Opposition has suggested that, when reviewing citizenship eligibility, a period longer than two years would be an appropriate reform to consider. I assume that honourable members opposite strongly support the need for criminal deportation in serious events of this sort. However, if the people who are involved in such brutal acts are able to be here for a period of two years and are then eligible for Australian citizenship, it is a nonsense to talk about criminal deportation. It is very unlikely that that remedy would be open to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot deprive citizens of their entitlements, particularly if they have forfeited another citizenship. We cannot leave them stateless. That is why the act of granting citizenship has to be seen as a very important step. There needs to be time to assess accurately whether or not the waiver that is involved in this Bill is something that might prejudice the Australian national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that very reason we believe the period of two years for eligibility is too short. This becomes clear when we look at this legislation against the background of these horrific events that have occurred and which may have involved our new settlers. Australia has a very good outcome with character checking. In fact, migrants generally have a much lower propensity to commit criminal acts than Australians. On the statistics that I have seen, the only national group that has a higher average than Australians to commit criminal acts is New Zealanders. That does not absolve us from the responsibility of maintaining proper character checking and a legislative regime to ensure that that will happen. We also need to look at the citizenship question that the State Labor member for Cabramatta has put clearly in issue by his reference to the need for deportation in these cases if non-citizens are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Opposition, I take this opportunity to commend the legislation. The decisions in it are appropriate. They strengthen the regime of character checking. That is a matter of fundamental importance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, and the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in supporting the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill aims to protect Australian citizens and society from what is classified as notorious or disreputable characters who could present a danger to our country if allowed to enter Australia. The determination of this by reference to a person's actual criminal conduct or association with any other person, group or organisation who the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe has been or is involved in criminal conduct is action that we must take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that are contained in the Bill will allow the Minister, as the Minister has indicated tonight in his second reading speech, to refuse to grant or cancel a visa or entry permit if a person is not considered to be of good character, or who is likely to be engaged in criminal conduct of any description whilst in Australia; and to refuse to issue or to cancel a visa or entry permit or to expel a person to whom refugee status has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The legislation clearly states that the Minister must be satisfied, in cancelling that visa, that the person would be likely to engage in criminal conduct or could vilify a segment of the Australian community, incite discord in the community or part of the community, or could represent a danger to all or part of that community. In saying that, I believe that it is appropriate at this stage&mdash;and I know I will only have a limited time because of other events that are going to overtake me&mdash;to place on record my appreciation of the work that has been done during this term of parliament by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, when all probabilities are taken into account, possibly the last Bill that this Minister will have the opportunity to introduce into this Parliament. Too often we have a tendency to praise a person when that person is no longer here. I would like to have placed on record my appreciation of the work that this Minister has done during the term of this Government. I believe that it is only appropriate that it should be said here and now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly proud to have had the opportunity of working with the Minister. I have been particularly proud, too, of the reforms and restructuring that have been put into place in the areas of immigration and local government affairs. I am particularly pleased at the very caring and humane attitude which the Minister has taken at all times in all pieces of legislation dealing with immigration that have come before this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there has been a change out there in the community at large when groups have been able to communicate with and consult with the Minister on such a scale. I am very pleased that I have had an opportunity, as I will continue to have during the debate on this Bill, to have said that, so that at least the Minister knows that we appreciate the very caring and humane way in which he has handled what are at times very difficult pieces of legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 23 February 1993, at 2 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Mr Speaker or, in the event of Mr Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought I would take this opportunity to thank the House for its forbearance over the course of the last year, for the passage of legislation and the proceedings of its business which it has allowed to be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very eventful year. It is not every day that a constituent seeks an audience in Kings Hall without getting out of his car first. It was a first for us in our five years. Of more long term significance for members was the recent decision of the High Court which ruled that the former honourable member for Wills and other candidates in that by-election were not eligible to stand for parliament. The High Court declared, of course, that Mr Cleary had an office of profit under the Crown at the time of his nomination and ruled as well that the Liberal and Labor candidates were not eligible to stand for parliament as they had failed to take reasonable steps to renounce their foreign citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were events of some magnitude for us in this place where we tend to notice all these sorts of rulings and conditions. The implications raised are far reaching in terms of fairness and the representative nature of the parliament. I think that both sides of the House would probably agree that only a constitutional referendum can decide that matter in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters notwithstanding, the Parliament has had a very busy year as the Government has worked to continue on a far reaching reform process which it embarked upon nearly 10 years ago. I know that this has put great pressures on members; not only on members, but on all those involved in our parliamentary system of government to make certain that it operates smoothly. I extend to all members of parliament, therefore, my thanks for their efforts over the course of the year and wish them a happy Christmas and an enjoyable and well earned break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came here, we were well and truly up by early December. But a few things have changed over the years which make life more bearable. In my first parliament, often we used to go home in daylight. We would go back to the Kurrajong Hotel and have a shower and a change of undies and come back. Some, of course, did not bring a change with them. But we always knew which ones they were. Not all rooms had facilities either. We would come back often at night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that, in the old Parliament House, in the dining room we would have supper at 3 a.m. They would bring out the sausage rolls and the sausages and everything else and everybody would be into the bangers and mashed potatoes. That was regarded as appropriate fare at 3 in the morning. Honourable members used to sleep around the corridors and on the lounges and in their offices. Of course, in those days, there were two and three people to an office often. It was pretty hard to sleep in there, so they would sleep in the corridors, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all changed in the period of the Whitlam Government when the 11 o'clock rule came in and, since then, that has never been the order of the day. Occasionally we break it, but not very often. So the hours are better, but we are sitting longer, I think. The House is sitting for most of December these days. The Senate sits interminably, as we know. We/they will sit again this year nearly to Christmas. So it does make a long year of it and it means that there is a lot of pressure on families and being away from home, and that is something which I think all members experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the hours that we put in, of course, and the days that we put in, this is also true of all the people who support us here in our offices. Those people in all of our offices in the building generally are here, even when we are not here, keeping the system rolling. I am sure that we owe them a very clear debt of gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must particularly mention the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk, Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris. With the able support of the Clerk Assistants and the Sarjeant-at-Arms, Phil Bergin, they have been able to again ensure that the business of the House is managed smoothly and competently. I do not know of any Department of the Commonwealth which has a more dedicated interest in serving a group of people than this Department does in serving the Parliament and its every need. The courtesy and service which have always been extended to us&mdash;not just the efficiency, but the courtesy and service&mdash;have been, I think, almost without peer anywhere in the Commonwealth realm. This has been my experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Lyn, of course, when he was a much younger, fresh-faced Clerk Assistant&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;and I was a callow youth. But we have been here 23 years. He has been here longer than I have, but I have been here long enough&mdash;23 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do like determining my own demise. The Joint House Department, which is responsible for feeding us, informing us, guarding us, arranging or transportation, looking after our surroundings, has again served us well. I must also particularly mention the transport officers who tend to look after our movements, which are particularly special to us&mdash;in getting from home to here or around Canberra or to and from the airport, or even other movements in other capital cities. They have always been particularly obliging and very close to members, and have stayed close, which is a nice thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to note the fine work of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff, who operate under constant pressure to record every pearl of wisdom uttered by us. You have got to have a lot of heart to be a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporter. There are some members in here I would not want to report. I reckon I would be a total failure at that. I would say, `This is rubbish, forget it&mdash;just a big space'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though I know this dedication to recording accurately what is said is the predominant culture of the office, if one had just a modicum of discernment one would, on a number of occasions, want to put the pencil right through the text. Not only do they not do that, but also they make the text read so nicely. We say thank you to them for carrying out a very difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other largely unseen group are the people who staff the switchboard&mdash;the switchboard operators. The supervisor, Marlene, and her crew&mdash;Dalroy, Pam, Margaret, Gaylene and Ann&mdash;are always courteous. That is what I find whenever I use the service and I am sure this is the experience of all honourable members. We thank them very much and wish them the best for Christmas and the New Year as well. I repeat my thanks to the Clerk, his officers, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the telephonists, and the transport officers. I would also like to thank the people who work in the Parliamentary Library who are particularly attentive to our needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to commend the work of the Whip on the Government side&mdash;I am sure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will mention his office-bearers. I would like to mention George Gear and his Deputy, Ted Grace, who maintain the numbers and round up reluctant members. But the best thing they do for us is deliver victories in the divisions. I acknowledge the work of George's office and Catherine Mundy on his staff, whose work is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the Parliamentary Liaison Office. Clare Nairn and her staff have done a wonderful job in assisting the passage of the Government's business program. We thank them very much for their hard work and professionalism in keeping an eye on the House, following the ebb and flow of the debate, knowing when someone has to speak, when amendments have to be moved, getting people down to do that and getting the legislation in. These are important things. I understand that Clare has completed her stint with the Parliament this session and will be returning to my Department. We wish her all the best and thank her for her enthusiasm and patience&mdash;thank you, Clare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also acknowledge the excellent work done by the Leader of the House, Kim Beazley. His unfailing good humour&mdash;particularly his laughing at my jokes; he cheers me up no end&mdash;and persistence have kept the House operating effectively. Even in the most heated moments, Kim and his new Opposition counterpart have been able to work cooperatively and get the business of the House through despite political differences. I thank him and I thank Warwick Smith also. Of course, Wal Fife was his predecessor in the job and we would like to remember Wal's contribution over the course of the year and over many years. We thank him as well. They are both good-natured, good people and we have been able to work with them effectively and well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you have one of the most difficult jobs in the House&mdash;on occasions I do pride myself on making it more difficult for you. I should think you, like the rest of us, have to earn your money. I think encouraging Speakers to perform is a very worthy thing for all of us to aspire to. I thank you and your Deputy, Ron Edwards, for your efforts this year in bringing order to this place. I know it has not been easy. A lot of public policy has been discussed this year and there have been big issues between the Opposition and the Government. Obviously, this often spills over into public debate in the chamber. Your adjudicating that debate is a very hard thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the last Christmas in parliament for a number of members from both sides of the House. I would like to take the opportunity to thank those honourable members who are retiring and wish them well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution of one of these departees&mdash;the Hon. Gerry Hand, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;has been outstanding. He is always out there amongst the people. He truly is someone who has represented a constituency conscientiously and he has made a tremendous contribution to public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his ministerial career, he has distinguished himself in a number of portfolios: Aboriginal Affairs, where he had the responsibility, and I think he would say the privilege, of setting up ATSIC which has totally remodelled the way in which Commonwealth moneys in the area of Aboriginal affairs are expended in this country; and, more latterly, in the immigration portfolio, where probably we have never seen greater change than in the recent period. We thank him for his contribution to the nation in these important areas and for doing things with such a great sense of compassion and good spiritedness. We will be sorry to lose him. We will miss him most particularly for his good humour and, I know in the case of some members, for his tips for Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us who are associated with the Parliament know that the worst of pressures are borne by families. The demands of public life impose great penalties on families. It diminishes their privacy and free time. We all feel that, and know that a heavy price is being paid by those who are closest to us. That is one of the great misgivings that I am sure we all have. We want to remember them. I think I can say on behalf of the Government&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition will probably make the same point on behalf of the Opposition&mdash;that we owe a special debt to our families who suffer with us the burdens of public office, and do it graciously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final thing I would like to talk about is simply the way in which the chamber has operated and the public reporting of it. I think this is one of the great chambers of the world. We debate and settle national issues here at great speed in comparison with other countries. Our debate is robust and the nation knows what we think about things. It knows how the debate changes, how the issues are put and how the weighting is made. It results in a lot of conflict, but I would like to think that we do not take the conflict beyond these doors&mdash;that is in a personal sense, although we certainly do in a policy sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the chamber works. I know that with the televising of parliament some people in the community have felt that the tension of the Parliament or the transmission of its debate is maybe too vigorous for either the community or the household which is watching it to absorb. I have always begged to differ on this point. I have always thought that we have effectively cleared national pressures in the clearing house of national pressures: the House of Representatives. The place does its work and it does so effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other countries national issues are settled by shots ringing out across the footpaths and through the houses, towns and cities where there is a lot of grief, conflict and human misery. This does not happen here. Big issues are brought to bear here. We have feelings about them and we express those feelings. It does generate some heat, but we do resolve them&mdash;if not immediately, in a very short space of time. Maybe there has been some culture shock with the televising of parliament, but the place has always been thus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told a story recently about Winston Churchill. As a child, his father took him to a circus and the star exhibit at the circus was somebody called `the boneless wonder'. Churchill's father said that Winston's young eyes should not see this exhibit and he was denied entry to it. Churchill said to the then Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, `It took me 50 years to wait to see a boneless wonder sitting on the Treasury benches of the House of Commons'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It went on in this vein to show just how robust and spirited the debate of the House of Commons was. When one looks at the history of that chamber one sees that it has been more robust than this one. In other chambers&mdash;for instance, the Japanese Diet&mdash;it is fisticuffs every week. In some of the chambers of Europe, certainly in France&mdash;for example, the Council of Europe&mdash;it is on every week. In comparison, the behaviour in this chamber is relatively demure. We remember that in the 1970s somebody threw a glass of water over somebody. Someone else has thrown some papers and books, but I think that is about the end of it. I do not know whether you would say that on the international scale of things we are a pretty timid or dreary lot, but we try to keep it interesting. Perhaps the public should understand that in here their interests are being debated and we are keeping faith with the best democratic traditions of the country. This is a deeply democratic country and we have deeply democratic traditions. Those traditions are very obvious to us in this Parliament. At any rate, I think we all enjoy it, and that is important. We think we are doing good work and good things for the nation and that is important too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all members on both sides for their contribution to the debate. I thank the Speaker again. To all the people who have served with us: I thank you for another year of effort. We will go home to our families, I am sure, looking forward to the Christmas break and of course, for 1993, an election for another parliament where it will all begin again. Happy Christmas to everyone, and a happy New Year. </PARA>

We all spend an enormous amount of time away from home, not only in this place but also in the performance of our parliamentary duties in other places around Australia and elsewhere. We should always reflect on the tremendous support that we get from our families and the very important contribution that they make to us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an occasion to thank a lot of people. I should begin by thanking some of my immediate colleagues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very conscious of the extent to which they are hassled when the other day one of my senior staffers rang one of my back bench colleagues and the back bench colleague said to him, `You must be returning my call'. When my staffer said, `Which call?', the backbencher said, `The one from last May'. I think there is an element of that involved. They do take the knocks when something goes wrong. I remember that one former staffer of ours commented recently that he had helped run 24 election campaigns; politicians had won seven and he had lost the rest. There is a bit of that feeling, I am afraid, when it comes to dealing with our staff and it is appropriate at this stage that we recognise the tremendous contribution they have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said, a lot of people are leaving this Parliament on this occasion. I think it is important that we single out a few of those from our side for particular mention. Firstly, Fred Chaney has made a very distinguished contribution to both Houses of this Parliament. I want to put on the record a recognition of that contribution, both in government and in Opposition. From a personal point of view, he has been a tremendous friend to me in the last couple of years and he has done an outstanding job in some of the work he has taken on in his final days in this place. He did not have to, in a sense, continue to be as active as he has been, but he has gone 110 per cent in support of us winning the next election, and we should acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wal Fife has been mentioned. Wal has been around the parliamentary Party for about 40 years and I think he has served in Australian parliaments for something like 35 years. He again was a very good friend of mine and I was very disappointed to see him go. I think we should acknowledge the contribution that he has made in government&mdash;at the State and Federal level&mdash;in opposition, and as a friend, adviser and confidante to many of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others from our side all making their departure include Ian Wilson and Peter Shack; the Tasmanian firebrands, Max Burr and Bruce Goodluck; and Harry Edwards. I single out Harry Edwards because he had the misfortune one way or another of teaching me economics for several years at the Sydney University. I have always respected Harry. He will remain, I am sure, as active as he has ever been in matters related to parliamentary duties; but, more broadly, he has a very wide range of interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate, Senators Durack, Lewis, Walters and Flo Bjelke-Petersen are all leaving.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Generally, it is the Leader of the National Party who speaks at this stage, but I shall slightly pre-empt him and add my own comments in support of the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). On this occasion, I would like to thank, firstly, and unusually, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Clare Nairn. She does an extraordinary amount to keep this House running and this is definitely her last Christmas in the position that she holds; she will be moving on elsewhere. She has the trust of both sides of the House. She has the business of the day in her head, and has the most exquisite internal clock, watch or whatever I have every come across. She absolutely times to the second when people have to appear in the House and when Ministers are required. She handles parliament like a veteran, even though she has only been here for a short time. Her staff back her up&mdash;Lyn, Hannele and Ruth. Our thanks go to them, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank members of our Caucus for their contribution during the year, particularly those who are committee chairmen, and those who spend a considerable amount of time making the private members' business of the House work well. It is an interesting innovation. Both sides of the House are required to perform in that regard and they do extremely well. It has made this Parliament, as it has not been for some time, a real sounding board of national opinion, and that is a very important function for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my counterpart, Warwick Smith. I must assure Warwick that we are going to do absolutely everything we can to ensure that there is no effective challenger to him for a front bench position from Tasmania after the next election is held. We do that, at least in no small part, due to the regard in which we hold him. Probably only very few of us know these things&mdash;Warwick certainly does; Wal Fife does; Ian Sinclair does; and Gordon Scholes and a few others on this side of the House know&mdash;but we share one secret: we absolutely know how to destroy the working of this place. We know that, at the end of the day, if it is determined by an Opposition that the House will not work, then it probably will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years both sides of the House have held themselves in terrorem against the day when they might be on the other side, and so nobody goes quite for broke. This is the oldest living nuclear balance, and it continues. It is most important that it is fully comprehended that that is the case. Very few people know that most legislation goes through here, even when guillotined by leave, and it is a very significant contribution to the functioning of the democratic process that there are, by and large, no go areas. I would also like to add those thanks to Wal Fife who was Manager of Opposition Business for part of the time. I said a great deal about him towards the end of last year and I do not, for time's sake, want to reiterate that; but he will be very much a loss to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to go through a list, as the Leader of the Opposition did for those of his colleagues who were leaving this place. Though there may be an opportunity for us to come back again and do that&mdash;it is possible within the parliamentary timetable&mdash;this is certainly their last Christmas, and the last Christmas here ought to be acknowledged for a few on our side of the House. I will go first to Gordon Scholes, who has been a noted parliamentary contributor for many years. He has held just about every office of this chamber that can be held, and he has held a deal of ministerial positions as well. He is a very canny individual and he will be a loss to us on this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge an old Cabinet colleague of mine, Stewart West, who is also going to be leaving after this election. He was a most extraordinary person to be with in Cabinet; he was the most punctilious individual with a brief that I think I have ever come across. He was a loss to government and he will be a loss to parliament. Gerry Hand comes very much into that category as well. I think that he will enjoy life enormously. He has a great gusto for it. Most of us will miss this place terribly&mdash;he will not. He is definitely going to fill his time effectively when he leaves here; but he will be missed by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of other very substantial contributors who are leaving: Ric Charlesworth, Elaine Darling, Steve Dubois, John Gayler, Lloyd O'Neil and John Scott. They are not going to be with us after this election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, in many ways, this place has become a more difficult place to serve in and to survive a lengthy political career. There is no question about that. I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister say that he has been here for 23 years. I cannot believe that somebody who looks like that has been here for 23 years. The fact of the matter is that 23 years in this place would kill most of us now. My father was able to survive for 32 years. There was something of him left at the end of it, but not a hell of a lot. The physical difficulties of functioning here for that period are now just enormous. I think one or two of the names I have read out are basically casualties of that. They will be missed because they have been great contributors to the parliamentary process while they have been here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clerks and the Serjeant-At-Arms keep this place functioning with tremendous tolerance and tremendous straight faces. I cannot believe that they can look so stolidly and impartially at all of us from the shenanigans that we inflict upon this place, but they do, and they give very sound and interesting advice. One of the interesting things about being Leader of the House is, firstly, to be able to acknowledge to yourself that you know nothing and, secondly, to be able to acknowledge that you will actually get an opportunity to worm out of the hole by a quick consultation with the Clerk. You know that a consultation with him will not be passed on to your opponents, and you know something very similar is going on by your opponent with another Clerk's ear, to ensure that effectively when we do things in this place we get a sort of rough facsimile of conforming to the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should acknowledge the attendants who protect and assist us; the Sound and Vision Office; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>staff, who of course have already been acknowledged; the catering staff; the people who keep the grounds in good order; the cleaners; the maintenance staff; the air-conditioning staff; and the gardeners. I particularly thank the staff and the people who perform the essential function on our side of the House of keeping it going: the Whips, George and Ted, and Catherine Mundy in particular, who basically from our side of the House runs this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Praise should be given to the Presiding Officers. They are long suffering and much maligned but, nevertheless, I know from my personal knowledge of them that you, Mr Speaker, your Deputy, and your assistants from both sides of the House hold those positions basically because you love this place. You love its forms, you love its traditions and what it stands for in terms of the political life of the nation, and you do acquit yourself with great tolerance and forbearance given the number of times when you may feel that what we do in this place offends against some aspect of those traditions or some aspect of the regard in which this House is held in the national community. So we thank you as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join too in the comments that have been made on our families. We put them to the test regularly. In many cases that test fails, and that is very much a matter of misery for us and misery for them. This is a life in which we are not permitted self-pity. Nobody can walk out of this place and expect pity from the general community. At least there is one thing we can share in a bipartisan sort of way: we actually all do know what each other goes through in this life and we can all have at least that unspoken sympathy for those personal experiences. All that remains, I think, is to join the comments of the other two speakers in wishing everybody a happy Christmas and, on this side of the House, a successful new year&mdash;and, for those opposite, a happy one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) prompted me to say a few extra words about some of the colleagues I had forgotten who are not contesting their seats again. He mentioned Gordon Scholes. I would particularly like to say that I have had a long association with Gordon here. He is one of the few people in the chamber who have been here longer than I have&mdash;since 1967, when he won Corio. He held various substantial portfolios over his period in this place and was Speaker during the turbulent period of 1975. He acquitted himself in that period with great dignity, thoughtfully and carefully&mdash;a period of great turmoil when a Prime Minister had been appointed who did not have the confidence of the House. He conducted the Parliament during that period and then presented himself at Government House with the Parliament's decision. It was a time when stature and judgment mattered. I think most honourable members on both sides would say that he distinguished himself during that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did so subsequently in other portfolios. He was Minister for Defence in a senior and significant portfolio when the Government was elected in 1983. He held that for a number of years and then gave the Government substantial service for most of the 1980s. So Gordon did see ministerial service and service as Speaker. Most particularly, he flew the flag of the Labor Party in the seat of Corio with great distinction. He always held the seat despite the swings, I think because he was held in such high regard by the community of that region. Gordon, many of us will miss you being around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Stewart West was a member of the Cabinet with me, as Gordon was, and Kim mentioned Stewart this evening. I cannot remember exactly when Stewart arrived in the House but it was in the 1970s. Before he came here I used only to see him at New South Wales Labor Party conferences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not often agreeing with me, but we found common cause in many things. He more than distinguished himself. Kim said that he was a punctilious member of the Cabinet. No Cabinet Minister ever read Cabinet submissions quite with the comprehension that Stewart read them. He would be across the subjects and across the themes and making a valuable contribution in the areas for which he had responsibility. Through great change in the 1980s in housing&mdash;one of the areas that he had&mdash;he was a substantial contributor to the changes which took place in the financial deregulation of the housing industry and the subsequent changes to that industry. He comes from a working class area, the area of Wollongong, and he has never done or said a thing which he thought or knew was injurious to the people he represented, only always speaking in their favour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other retiring members who are not Ministers also served with distinction and were part of this Caucus during these parliamentary years when I think never has a Caucus of the Labor Party ever distinguished itself as this one has for good sense and judgment. There are a number of members who have served here in that period, taking the issues on board, and making some of the great changes which have given Australia the opportunity to be a successful, modern industrial country again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me name a few of them: John Scott, Elaine Darling, Lloyd O'Neil, Steve Dubois, and Ric Charlesworth. Ric is probably the only Olympian who was a serving member of the Parliament when he attended an Olympic Games. Sir Hubert Opperman was an Olympian but, if my memory serves me correctly, it was before he became a member of parliament. This group of members has served the Parliament with distinction. They are now going to do other things with their lives, some because they have just decided that they want to do something else. This is a terribly healthy attitude for members to take. Having been in here, having served the public well, they have decided to do something else with their lives and give another person the opportunity to represent their constituencies. I want to place on record my appreciation of their parliamentary service. I say as Leader of the Labor Party, for the distinctive way that they have contributed to the affairs of the Labor Party as a parliamentary party, that all of us will miss them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extend Christmas greetings and pick up one particular point from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). He referred to the pressures of modern day politics on the functioning of members, and I think Western Australian members have a particular cross to bear. I make two points arising from this. I think it is sometimes easier to function on a working honeymoon involving four nations in four days than it is to function in a four-day sitting week on the floor of the Federal Parliament. There was Mexico, the United States and the UK in four days, and then Thailand on top, and back on duty in time to address the package that will alter the future of Australia and change the Government at the next election. But this is the occasion for Christmas greetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to make is in relation to the sitting pattern of the Parliament, and the functional pressure on every member and senator of this Parliament, their families and staff, and others. If there is a happy compromise, the basic arrangement of two weeks on and two weeks off&mdash;the first week Tuesday to Thursday and the second week Monday to Thursday&mdash;does constitute as good a system as we can get. I stake a claim for the next parliament, under the coalition government, that this House should never sit on Fridays, nor ever contemplate going back to sitting on Fridays as was the pattern for the first few years after I was elected in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee was set up which addressed this question in some detail. I made a submission to that committee about a stabilised sitting schedule. There is no easy solution to these matters, but in extending a happy Christmas I think it relevant to make the point that the Leader of the House is correct in his statement that there are inordinate pressures placed on members in terms of the physical commitment and the hours of service involved, and I certainly acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to salute those Australians in service for their Government and their country at this time, not only those in the armed forces in those six places I referred to earlier today&mdash;those in Somalia, Cambodia, the elements still in the Gulf, the Sahara, the Middle East and Pakistan. I also refer to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are not all on cocktail circuit postings of great comfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite the example of those working in Mexico City, the capital of Mexico. Mexico is a magnificent country showing a considerable economic plus, but equally it is dominated by a killing smog over much of the city area for most of the time. It is so bad that consideration is being given to not sending people with young children to Mexico City because of the difficulties it creates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of those Australians in the service of the Government of Australia in a wide range of jobs: those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, those in seconded service to the World Bank and elsewhere, and those on aid projects. I commend them on their work, and extend Christmas greetings to them through this forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Parliament more specifically, I extend my very best wishes to the large number of honourable members retiring from both sides of the House. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House have detailed those in the Labor Party. I acknowledge especially the service of the former Speaker of the Parliament, the honourable member for Corio, Gordon Scholes, and also the honourable member for Grey, Lloyd O'Neil, with whom I served on the committee dealing with that wonderful subject, transport&mdash;and particularly rail transport and the east-west corridor. That committee provided a basis for the advent of the National Rail Corporation on which the Western Australian Parliament finally, quite recently, passed legislation. It is now about to become operational. I would like to take this opportunity to salute the work of that committee and to note that it has been a catalyst for ideas. Particularly I note the service of the honourable member for Grey, who has taken a deep interest in the operation of Australian National and rail as a mode of transport over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to members of the Liberal Party, I would like to highlight the retirement of my neighbour and colleague the honourable member for Hume, Wal Fife, who has served in both the New South Wales Parliament and the Federal Parliament. Wal has put in decades of service, not just in a parliamentary role in both the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and the Federal Parliament; he also chose to take upon himself many community roles&mdash;roles which were not absolutely essential&mdash;with regard to hospital work and a raft of other activities. He took a leadership role in connection with hospitals in his electorate, especially in Wagga. He was involved in a whole range of other activities, and he gave some very decisive leadership, for example on the campus location of the then college of advanced education, now Charles Sturt University, which showed a lot of foresight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the National Party, I pay a particular tribute to the honourable member for Lyne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point of the Leader of the House. He is one of nature's gentlemen. The honourable member for Lyne is also a very courageous person who has suffered a horrific personal tragedy but has elected to carry on in the service of his electorate. I salute his service to this Parliament and to the widest possible range of community groups he represents. Nothing was too small or too large for Bruce to undertake. He finetuned my process of representation when I was a very young and new member of the New South Wales Parliament. In a sense he showed me the `two-minute Tim' trick: the ability to be available in front of a post office or a council chamber and do a fair dinkum tour of one's electorate, being readily available to everybody. From some small towns with unpronounceable names in his electorate to the very biggest centres in his electorate, Bruce Cowan covered the distance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mallee, Peter Fisher, also played a role in my parliamentary service. I salute his two decades of service. Peter Fisher&mdash;damn him&mdash;happened to be at the MCG in 1984 when news of the latest redistribution came out regarding Federal seats in southern New South Wales. History might record that if Peter Fisher had not been at the MCG grand final, and if Tim Fischer had not been at the MCG grand final, Peter Fisher would not have had the opportunity to convince Tim Fischer that then was the moment when he should switch from State to Federal politics. He was responsible for describing the atrocious coat I was wearing on that occasion&mdash;which I still have not given to St Vincent's, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Fisher, again, has been a dedicated servant to his electorate. Like Bruce Cowan, he will be greatly missed. I believe they are both determined to get on with one or two other things&mdash;for instance, the deep interest they have in the land and local projects. I wish both Bruce Cowan and Peter Fisher the very best in their deserved retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might refer to one other neighbour of mine who is retiring&mdash;the honourable member for Indi, Mr Ewen Cameron. He also fits that description of nature's gentleman. He has just returned from service with the United Nations. I have heard a lot about the UN observer trip in my years of service. From all I heard when I passed through there, the honourable member for Indi served Australia well in his representation at the United Nations. The caravan that Ewen Cameron polluted his electorate with was a notable dimension of his service to his electorate. It is a gigantic vehicle with signs all over it.

Right down in the bowels of this place there is an area called the carpenters shop. For the first time in my political service I had occasion to visit the carpenters shop. I had heard about this shop. One of the workers down there is the son of an Army friend of mine. I went to meet him and to wish him well. I might add that the conditions there have recently been improved. There had been quite severe dust problems of an occupational health nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whether it be to the carpenters of the Parliament, who sometimes perhaps know more about some activities of the Parliament than the rest of us, or whether it be to everyone else involved from both the House of Representatives and the Senate sides&mdash;notwithstanding certain missives from Clerks of the Senate&mdash;I extend to them my best wishes for a happy Christmas and a happy New Year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aviation services afforded to honourable members are often taken for granted. But a number of people from the airlines of Australia, including from Ansett and Australian Airlines principally, go out of their way to facilitate the almost impossible demands of members and senators on a raft of occasions. Whether it be a `Melissa' at one of the lounges in the Sydney airport or a range of other people right around Australia, their particular service is often under-recognised as we belt out with our bags to catch the closing door of an improved flight connection. I take this opportunity to salute all of them right around Australia, particularly those from the key airports of Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, on the work that they carry out and for the slight softening of the schedule that they bring us as we cover all of our commitments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my early months in parliament I ran into some problems with the Speaker&mdash;I hope I will not have that trouble tonight. Speaker Billy Snedden took a bit of a shine to me because he liked to hear my accent. It made him nostalgic, so I got the call far more than I do now. However, I tested the patience of Billy about five months into my first year when I was suspended from the service of the House. I caused a ruckus. I have to say in confession that I picked the issue deliberately. My colleague Stewart West was the only one who knew that I was going to do it. I kicked up a fuss because of a uranium issue. I had some problems because some of my colleagues did not want to count me out. Nevertheless, that is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got back to my Federal electorate office in Hindmarsh and was recalling this particular incident to Clyde Cameron, who preceded me, he said that that was about the same time that he was in before he was kicked out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When moving into government we&mdash;that is, John Scott and some of my colleagues&mdash;had a dreadful year because we entered into the Combe affair.

He was voted in by the Left, by the way&mdash;we have made a few mistakes. At the time Albert Monk was the President of the ACTU and he had the numbers. You may recall that Harold Souter was also in there vying for the position, but because there was no ACTU Congress the position had to be filled by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not have the numbers. On Labour Day 1969 Bill Brown of the Trades and Labour Council of South Australia died. He was a member of the executive. That position was contested by Jimmy Shannon who was of the Left. When he was elected he provided the numbers to allow Bob Hawke to become the President of the ACTU. The vacancy that Jim Shannon left was in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and I filled that vacancy and served in the trade union for 12 years. It is a position that I am extremely proud of holding. I feel privileged to have served and I will never ever be ashamed of being a trade unionist. </PARA>

When the present Prime Minister was giving the Budget Speech in, I think, 1986 I found some of it difficult to take and protested violently, but I was clever enough to get out before I was counted out. I was followed by my musketeer friends Lewis Kent and Peter Milton and the argument with the Government at that time was the sale of uranium to France.

The following year, while we were sitting in the old House and Paul was going through his Budget Speech, a note was delivered from Robert Tickner.

The Parliamentary Library has not been mentioned specifically, although it was referred to in some ways by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I want to mention special names. It does not mean that they are special and others did not do the job. Dr Rod Panter is perhaps one of the best researchers Australia has. I do not know how we can afford people like that. Rod and his team, the team in the law and government section and various other sections of the Parliamentary Library, are unique. I am sure that most people who use the Library would agree that the Australian Parliamentary Library would be alongside the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we measure our mark in this Parliament, sometimes it is measured by the number of speeches we make. If that is the score, then I have been a failure&mdash;perhaps a total failure. I believe that there are other measures, and I hope that my mark in this Parliament, in this democratic process, has been in our Caucus committees and parliamentary committees. I have tried, wherever possible, to engage the Fourth Estate in the issue of parliamentary committees because I believe it is a very important part of a democracy. I hope that some day they will wake up to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, senators such as Bronwyn Bishop are making their mark, perhaps in the wrong way&mdash;in a way that hurts&mdash;but, nevertheless, I think people are now starting to look at parliamentary committees. I think they have a tremendous role to play, and none more importantly than the role that was played just recently by Chairman Peter Morris in the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into ship safety. Tim Fischer mentioned the transport Committee. I was part of that. One can go on and on. Another example is the Public Works Committee. </PARA>

It is time there was a revolt on the back benches, because it is at the back bench level that we work together. We work together well, do we not? Ewen, Bruce and others have done this in many committees. I think that is to the benefit of democracy. If the Ministers decide to reject the wisdom of our reports, then that is also part of the process. But, in serving the people, we should ensure that these committees become more important. </PARA>

I have seen many on exhibition. I will not mention a particular Prime Minister, but I was in opposition at the time. It provided us in opposition with a great opportunity to score on the government.

I want especially to mention Jim Pender. As long as we have people like Jim Pender in the Public Service, Australia is in a good situation. In that particular delegation to Japan, which was quite strenuous, I had the great support in particular of Bob Katter. He is not with us now, but Bob was a very good friend.

Most importantly, I thank Michiko, my wife, my supporter, my friend, who has been beside me. It has sometimes caused some problems for some of you, but I was lucky to have my wife with me. I think it is a dreadful burden that members of parliament have to bear with the trouble and the hours and do not always have their family with them, especially the younger members who have children still at school.

John has expressed those sentiments very well tonight, and I think all of us appreciate what he is saying. Tonight, as someone mentioned earlier, the numbers that are actually retiring from the chamber are unprecedented. Because of that, I want to speak only briefly as I know that there are several on the other side who would like to make a few remarks, and I know that two of my colleagues on this side would like to have an opportunity to speak briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quickly take the opportunity, firstly, to thank the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), for his kind remarks and cooperation during the short period that I have had this task. I am trying to learn from him some of the tricks of the trade. I have to say that I learnt another one tonight. When you have a look at the list, you will see that the very last Bill tonight is the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill.

I then borrowed a copy of the Standing Orders. Lyn, I am sorry I had not been a great one to follow them closely, but I have since made some study.

To run a very busy and complicated portfolio as well as attempting to do this task puts great demands upon them, and they meet every challenge. We are an office that works well and with a great deal of good humour. On behalf of all my colleagues, I thank Whip Bob Halverson&mdash;and his assistant BA&mdash;who had to put up with some fairly difficult times with a new chum in the chair. They do a magnificent job, as I am sure do the Whips from the other side. </PARA>

I think he tries to deal as best he can with the very difficult personalities in this chamber. At various times tempers get heated, but he is still there. Whether he will be there later on is another question. I have known Leo for quite some time and have a regard for him, particularly because he is the only person who has ever occupied that chair as Speaker who has visited Flinders Island, which is the most remote part of Bass Strait and a part of my electorate. Leo, whatever you get for Christmas, I hope it will not be a pair of roller skates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my Leader, John Hewson, as well as Tim Fischer and Peter Reith. I thank John Hewson particularly for his kind remarks. I appreciate the words that he extended to me. I make special mention of several of the Labor members who are leaving, particularly Gerry Hand, who I hope will have a chance to say a few words. I had the very interesting opportunity to be shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs at a time when Gerry had the carriage of a piece of legislation which generated quite a deal of community discussion and debate in this place. I think the contribution that he made in this very difficult area and the genuineness with which he approached the topic are things that he will be remembered for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have been lucky in this chamber that the people who have taken on this task, from both the Opposition and the Government side, have generally been chosen by their colleagues and leaders. They try to do a job and fix things which cannot be fixed in the short term. They must try to display some empathy and understanding for the long term issues involved in that portfolio. I also pay a compliment to Dr Wooldridge for the work that he is doing. Gerry, it was a very difficult time, as you know. During that period, being a Tasmanian&mdash;I do not say that in any flippant sense&mdash;to take on that portfolio was doubly difficult. You extended to me courtesies which might not otherwise have been extended through a very difficult time. I am pleased to see that the approach to Aboriginal affairs in this country is now moving to what I would regard to be very sensible and bipartisan, and very genuine in attending to the very real challenges that face us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I have ever actually talked to Gordon Scholes about the observation I am going to make. I have served with him on many committees. In 1975, in the old chamber, when I was a student of political science and law, I used to be a regular attendant of the Parliament. I was there on that momentous day. I spent the day outside wandering around and talking with a colleague, Justin O'Byrne&mdash;someone who is very well known to me from my home town of Launceston. You did have a very difficult time. I thought it was befitting for your Prime Minister to pay you the tribute that he did. We do not share the same views about that event on every issue, but I thought it was a fitting tribute that was paid to you tonight. I salute you for the service you have given your nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several colleagues from my own side whom I want to mention&mdash;Wal Fife particularly. Wal Fife went into the New South Wales Parliament in 1957. I was three years old at the time. I think that is a tremendous period of service. I do not think it will be equalled by many of us here. I think Mr Beazley said that his father was here for 32 years and there was a little left of him when he finally departed. Wal Fife is a man with infinite wisdom. He is a man who exudes a gentleness but a firmness that many of us have drawn upon. He is a model for many in this place, wherever they might sit, as to how this game works. I hesitate to call it a game. Perhaps we should call it a profession&mdash;if we elevate it, perhaps the community will follow us. He has displayed the sentiments and the demeanour of a parliamentarian which we can all see as a valuable example and try to emulate. </PARA>

My good friend Peter Shack is a young man who is leaving prematurely from the Parliament. He has made a very strong commitment to this Parliament over a long period. His going out as a young man and then coming back again to keep fighting the way he has is another fine example. I will miss him as one of the people whom I am closest to in this place and I certainly wish him well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention my Tasmanian colleague, Max Burr, who is not here tonight, and his wife, Ros. We will miss Max, who has his electoral office in Launceston. He has been very much an individual politician. He has not been scared to take on his colleagues on this side of the House on any occasion about any matter. He has held a seat for us that we might not otherwise have held, by sheer dint of hard work on the ground in a very difficult electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bruce Goodluck, we know you have been ill and we hope that leaving this place will see your health return. You will be missed.

Putting people first is important. Bruce has always put people first. Bruce, I think that has been your finest contribution during your time in this place. I wish you well. The prospect of your former colleague Michael rejoining us did worry me a little, but I understand that it may be his younger brother. If that is the case, we certainly would welcome him. </PARA>

I would like to pay special tribute to both Prime Ministers whom I have served under. I make particular reference to Bob Hawke. It is no secret that I did not get on all that well with him in the early days, prior to coming here. We grew closer together while I was here. We both had one failing, which we both gave away.

I remember that one night when I was at a function and the people there were particularly upset with me, I said, `This isn't going too good' but by the end of the night we had worked our way through it and photos were taken. It is always a good sign in ethnic affairs that you are travelling pretty well when photos are taken at the end of the night. However, a bloke sidled up to me and said, `I would like to apologise, Minister, because we've got a demonstration planned for Friday'. I said, `That is good, who is it against?', and he replied, `You'. Being the tough guy that I am, I said to myself, `We're still not travelling all that well'. I said to him, `It had better be a good one because I get really upset if you don't have a good demo when I am involved'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want first to thank those who have said nice words about me tonight. I came into the parliament with my eyes open. I first stood for parliament in 1964 and I first seriously stood in 1966. It was not quite a vintage year for the Labor Party, but it was a watershed for the Labor Party. We got cleaned out, totally and absolutely. I only got beaten by 7,800 votes. It was not all bad. Seven months later, I was a candidate in an election and eight months later I was a member of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That year was also a watershed for the Labor Party. Whilst I won a by-election, Australia won a new political system&mdash;a rebirth of its political system which had died in 1949 and had been, I suppose, trampled by the advent of the DLP in 1955. Whilst I can remember the enthusiasm of the 1966 election, I am not sure that too many people in the Labor Party thought that we could win or ever thought that we could be a government again. I am certain that, on the night of the 1966 election, that was the feeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The by-election in 1967 was the result of an enormous amount of work by a lot of people. There are two people to whom I think I have to give real credit, and who later reaped the rewards of that effort&mdash;Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard. There were a lot of people who put in, but Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard almost lived in Corio for that period, and the result was that the politics of Australia were turned around. The Liberal Party was in a pretty bad way. I say that with some regret but, nevertheless, Harold Holt was Prime Minister 20 years after he had passed his prime. Billy McMahon was also a Prime Minister who was there while the Liberal Party was waiting to regenerate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go through those years again, but there was a lot of trauma and a lot of things happened. But what did happen was that the politics of this country became competitive again and the people of Australia were given a choice and, when they were given a choice, they changed governments when they thought changes in government were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity&mdash;I must say in a time of crisis&mdash;of becoming Speaker of this Parliament. I think the day that I became Speaker was one of the most traumatic days of my life, or many others. I seem to recall that I lost seven pounds in about four hours sitting in that chair wondering whether I would be Speaker, because Jim Cope at that stage had not resigned. It was not one of the great days for this Parliament and it was one of the lesser good days for Gough Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had later opportunities&mdash;and I do not want to go through those. It has been a privilege to serve in this place for 25 years. I have to thank a lot of people, particularly the 70,000-odd people who are the electors of Corio and the branch members and supporters of the Labor Party who have turned out year after year in good times and bad to support Labor candidates, not only when we were winning, but, I seem to remember, when we had no members at all and we were losing every seat by 4,000. They were still turning out. Over the river in Corangamite they were turning out, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament has a lot to do in a very short period. We are now in the new Parliament House. We have the opportunities, but we have not seized them. We are doing our business now the same way we were when I came here in 1967, but the business is not the same. One can say that the three years of Gough Whitlam changed the government of Australia and who governs Australia forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of legislation in this Parliament and the important matters which no longer get debated in this Parliament are far greater than they were in 1967. We cannot do the business in the chamber in the time we allocate ourselves and it is highly unlikely that we will allocate time in the chamber to be used for that purpose. I have advocated for many years that we need plenary and committee sessions of this Parliament so that we can deal with the routine business of the Parliament expeditiously without neglecting it, but leaving time in this chamber for the real business of the Parliament of Australia&mdash;that is, debating the major issues and the major legislation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to thank one or two people. I know the hour is late and I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has great difficulties. I sympathise with him, but I am afraid I cannot altogether bend to his will. I have had very few staff members during the time I have been a member, other than those when I was a Minister. I believe all have served me very loyally. I do not want to try to name them as I am sure to miss one at this stage and I want to thank them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are contesting a marginal seat or if you hold a provincial seat where you are an identifiable person and your office is the place people go to, your staff have to be able to carry the load. All of my staff have been able to carry the load and they have done it with great credit to themselves and with great benefit to me and, I hope, the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My family has put up with a lot. My kids were only so high when I came here; they had just started school. They did not&mdash;and do not&mdash;see their father very much. When you are a member of the Federal Parliament for 20 years your wife has to carry a very great load, and my wife has done that. I do not want to thank them because I do not think that is the right thing to do. I want to express my appreciation that I have been given the opportunity to pursue a career which does not come to many and which needs the support of everyone around you, including, and most importantly, the support of your family. This profession is very hard on families and there is never an occasion when there are not some families breaking up around us. It happens on a regular basis. I have been lucky, I think the Minister who spoke before me has been lucky, but others have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of those people who have served with me during the period. While I have been here I have had some successes and some failures. Some of the things which I thought I did right were some of the most criticised. I would never acknowledge that I thought the decision on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Invincible</EMPHASIS> was wrong. I am not sure whether we could have done more on that fateful day in 1975, but I made some remarks about that at the time of John Kerr's death and I do not think it would be appropriate to add to them at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I thank you and everyone in this chamber. I particularly thank the people who sit at the table and who have assisted me for 25 years, both as Speaker and as a member of this chamber who has quite often made demands on them which were a little greater than those of some other members. I make particular reference to Bernard Wright. He is not here at the moment, but he was my private secretary in my early days as Speaker. It was a very difficult job for a person who was going back into the Department and it was even more difficult when the person back in the Department who was deciding your promotion was someone like Doug Blake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank everyone in this chamber&mdash;the people who look after us. I do not want to name them, but they have always looked after us well and I hope I have always had good relations with them. It has been a pleasure. I have not quite finished yet, but we may or may not come back to this place early next year. I regret leaving it, but everyone has to pass through so that others can renew and improve the Parliament and the manner in which we are governed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Parliament has a task to meet. It has to do its business better, it has to change its procedures and it has to change the whole way in which it approaches its business if it is going to do it better; otherwise its reputation will become such that it will become irrelevant. </PARA>

If you were looking for someone in the place to call a parliamentarian, it would be Gordon Scholes. I do not think anyone who is in this chamber at present has had as distinguished a parliamentary career as Gordon. He has been Deputy Speaker, Speaker, a junior Minister and a Cabinet Minister. Even in his last year here he has been working actively as a committee chairman to ensure that we will have some better Standing Orders and procedures in this place in order to make the Parliament work better. In the years that I have been here, I do not think anyone has had as varied a career as Gordon. I think, Gordon, you will be a loss to us. I must say that the times you want to take points of order on me are a bit worrying and I will not miss that. But, Gordon, I think you will be sincerely missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Leader of the House is starting to have a heart attack because the program is getting away from him, but I want to make a couple of other comments. Last week Ian Sinclair sent me a Christmas card that said that we live in interesting times. I rang him up and asked him to stop making it as interesting as he was. But I think this year has been an interesting one for the Parliament. We had George Bush's visit earlier in the year when the senators came over and joined us. We had the Queen's visit, the change of Prime Minister, the arrival and departure of Phil Cleary and we had Bruce Goodluck's announcement that he really was chicken man and his decision to retire. Certainly some interesting things have occurred in the building this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to join with others in thanking a number of people in the building. I thank my colleague the President who shares some of the burdens of running this place with me; my colleague and Deputy, Ron Edwards; and Margaret Fisher in his office. I particularly thank the Clerks and Lyn Barlin, who, as the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister said earlier, is a person whose advice is always sound and who is unflappable. I think the Prime Minister said that you often wonder what is going on behind those inscrutable eyes as he watches us here each day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that members on both sides, the Leader of the House and his staff, the Manager of Opposition Business and his staff, the Whips, the Sergeant-at-Arms and the people who run the chamber have contributed a great deal to ensuring that we get where we are tonight. As I look at the clock, I see that I have to make sure that we do not stay here too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who run the smaller things in the building need to be thanked: John May and the transport people; the switchboard operators who have been mentioned earlier; the attendants who make sure we get our mail and who sometimes make sure we find our way to our offices and sometimes move the furniture; the people in the commentary box who let the people out there in electorate land know precisely which of us is speaking at any one time; and all of those other people who do the small jobs around the building. They might seem small to us, but they are important to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best things about being the ministerial head of the House of Representatives is the high level of dedication of the staff in this Department. The Prime Minister remarked on that earlier and he is absolutely right. I thank my own staff, both in Sydney and Canberra, for the support they have given me this year. In particular, I thank Ann Stewart, my senior adviser, who proves that those of us who employ women are smarter than those of us who do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us have spoken about the support we get from our families. Gordon in particular mentioned how his children were young when he first became a member and now they are grown up. My youngest son was one year old when I was elected and he is now just over 14. I saw my other children grow up, but I have not seen all that much of Martin growing up. That is something that happens to all of us. Too often people are willing to pillory members of parliament and say that we are people who do not do much of a job, that we just gad about. That is a sacrifice that people do not notice and our families, particularly our children, pay a very high price for our being in this job. You only start to realise that high price when you have been here for a while and go home on Friday afternoons&mdash;as I am sure John Howard and Gordon would tell you&mdash;and look at your kids and think you have missed a damned lot and ask whether it was worth it all. When people think those things sometimes it does make them pause. </PARA>

I hope that those of us who return&mdash;whether there is an election or not&mdash;will all be able to get on with each other a bit better than maybe we did sometimes this year. Yesterday I was unkind to the honourable member for Pearce and I want to tell him I am sorry. I might not be sorry to see you go, Fred, but I am sorry I said it. No, Fred; I have always found you to be a very decent person and I should not have said what I said yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two people about whom I wish to speak briefly. The first is Gordon Scholes. You have been spared having to listen to me because it was covered very much by what was said by Mr Speaker and also by Gordon himself. It summed him up. Gordon has been a great parliamentarian. He is a person who has enormous respect for this place. He has done everything he could to reform the House in the way it operates. He has put a lot of time into that. Those people who were here at the time&mdash;I was not here&mdash;have universally said that he was a great Speaker. We in the Labor Party owe a great debt to Gordon because he has also been a great member of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember 1966, which he mentioned. I remember in 1966 going home at lunch after being on a polling booth.

It goes back to the period when Gerry and his friends that he referred to over there&mdash;and Clyde Holding will well remember all of this&mdash;actually ran the show in Victoria at one stage.

Clyde was on another side; they thought they had the numbers. I was in another group which did not have any numbers. But there was a combination that grew up there, and I must say that the personal relationship with people like Gerry Hand became very strong through that period. We still disagreed on a lot of matters of policy, we still fought a lot, argued a lot and had a lot of differences. But I can honestly say that since 1965 in the Labor Party&mdash;and that was a long while ago&mdash;there is no person that I have known in the Party that I have respected more as a friend than Gerry. He can be tough&mdash;very tough&mdash;but once you know where you are with him, that is it. If he makes an arrangement with you, he sticks with it, and he sticks right through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to take part in this debate tonight, but I was drawn in by the very gracious comments of the Speaker and to some extent by the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I would like to put on the record my sense of privilege at having served in the Parliament in this place and in the other chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what the honourable member for Corio said, and I thought he very accurately summed up the burden which is borne by one's family. The balance to that&mdash;and families do give up a great deal&mdash;is that they to some extent share in the privilege of what we are enabled to do. In the case of my own family, I think that they felt as I did, that the whole 20 years would have been worth it for the couple of years that we had when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and where they shared with me an extraordinary close contact with the Aboriginal community and I think grew and became far better people for it. To the extent that I as a member feel guilty about the treatment that my presence in this place has meted out to my family, I take some consolation from the fact that they shared what I think were some very special times and some very special insights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank a number of people from my electorate of Pearce, which I have served only once and which has been a joy, and I particularly want to acknowledge the Liberal Party of Western Australia. When I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I gained the support of 10 people at a State conference which had 400 voting delegates. This was a fairly sobering experience, especially as my endorsement was shortly to come before the same group. I always thought it was a sign of their tolerance, or something, that they returned me as the No. 1 on the Senate ticket and guaranteed my return to the Parliament. But I acknowledge that, within that Party, I have had lots of vigorous debate. I acknowledge what has, I think, at times been the breadth of understanding that has been shown by some people who have been at times bitter opponents of mine but have been prepared to see me continue to represent them in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also acknowledge what I think is one's second family in politics, and that is one's staff. In my case, from the time I went into parliament, I was served by people who gave an extraordinary amount in terms of their own commitment. My wife, Angela, has always said that they have become a second family to me. That is certainly true, and I suspect it is true of most of us in this place. The people who are in Parliament House at the moment enjoying coffee I hope with my wife&mdash;Keith Kessell and Kirstin Mardardy&mdash;are simply the latest of a group of people for whom I have enormous affection, respect and a great deal of gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do feel that much of what I would have wished to say was said by the honourable member for Corio. I acknowledge the sacrifice of my wife and children. I enjoyed it when I said to my 22-year-old baby, Patrick, `I am giving up politics; let's go to the beach and I'll teach you how to make sand castles'. He seemed remarkably unthankful for this offer on my part and seemed to think he had learned to do that in my absence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry the Speaker is not in the chair, because he was gracious enough to say that he regretted what he had said about me yesterday. I was trying to work out whether I regretted what I had said about him yesterday which led him to respond. I thought I would like to say in his presence why I have had some heated moments with him. It probably is all the fault of someone lending me a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Lion Under the Throne</EMPHASIS>. As I recall, this was a history of Coke's contribution. We have a historian at the table, and he can probably correct me. In one of the early British parliaments I think the Speaker was Coke, and this is an account of his battles as Speaker. This led me to believe that the Speaker was the person who stood between the Parliament and the Executive. I had this vision of the early English Speakers sometimes being executed because they had dared to withstand the blandishments of the king&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the Leader of the House could improve on my history. I would have to say to the Speaker, and I am sorry he is not in the chamber, that I guess what has really disappointed me is that he has not been executed for standing up on behalf of the Opposition against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This explains, I think, my lack of patience with him, and at times my irritation. I did expect that from him. In the teeth of an election, which of course I hope and expect my Party to win, I will be judging the now Opposition, I hope the then government, against those same standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech which was made by a new member which most struck me was that of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who is not in the chamber at the moment. He made an outstanding maiden speech when he said&mdash;I quote from memory, so it may not be exact&mdash;`In the great struggle between Parliament and the Executive, I stand for the Parliament'. I am going to watch with an eagle eye the honourable member for Higgins as a Minister. I expect him to be a rigorous critic of the Speaker if he dare not protect the interests of the House and of the Opposition. I hope that the next Government, of whatever colour it might be&mdash;of course I expect it to be a Liberal-National Party government&mdash;will acknowledge the role of the Parliament against the Executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always hoped that this House, with its peculiar geography, would enhance the Parliament. I like the fact that the Executive is put in a separate wing; I think that is the right symbolism. I think this chamber is not the creature of the Executive. It should not be allowed to be and yet, of course, the Executive always has the numbers. Three years in this place has almost made me a republican. It has almost made me believe that the Westminster system is not the right system, but I suspect that is wrong. I think that the Westminster system is right for Australia but it requires a parliament which is self-conscious, very strong, and which actually regards the Executive with suspicion. I look forward to watching the Parliament in future as being a parliament in that light. </PARA>

It is pleasing to be able to say that I leave it without any regrets or any enemies, and with an enormous pride in the people of the Mallee whom I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mallee today takes in about one-fifth of Victoria and includes the district of Mallee, the district of Wimmera, and a major part of the western district. The name `Mallee' conjures up many images. Many people here think of the periodical dust storms that sweep in, not just across southern Victoria but also across New Zealand. We can think of the unique blend of flora and fauna contained there. I particularly think of the innovations of the farming community that have made such major contributions to our agricultural production, to farming techniques and to machinery invention and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we speak constantly of sustainable development. At times I wonder whether we really know what we are speaking of. My region was regarded as marginal country, but this year we will probably have a threefold productivity increase over what we had some 20 years ago, on soils that were considered fragile but which today are in better heart than they were one or two decades ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly tonight to the worst period of economic and social decline that we have ever encountered in our region. Tragically, this has taken place over the last few years. Despite this, the people in my constituency grasped the positives. They seized on the strengths of their communities to release a new spirit of vigour and innovation. Since that time, particularly since the 1982 drought, we have seen the formation of community structures that have avoided many of the tragic circumstances that took place across Australia, and particularly across rural Australia. As an example we saw the first community appointment of a rural counsellor, from which extended the rural counselling scheme which is now so valuable across so much of country and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like particularly to thank the people of Mallee, who have elected me nine times, returning both myself and my Party and at the last election making Mallee the safest seat in the Federal Parliament. I thank particularly the people in my small home community of Yaapeet. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, John Scott, spoke of a boy from Glasgow being elected to the Parliament of Australia. It is also fairly unique for a guy who comes from a village of 50 people to gain preselection and be elected to the Federal Parliament. I thank my home community for that. I praise the tolerance and the respect they have shown to my family and me, irrespective of any differences we may have in political affiliation or policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, I also thank all the Clerks, and all the people who administer and service this Parliament.

It has indeed been a privilege to be part of this vital democratic institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate to have experienced the old Parliament House and to have taken part in proceedings in this magnificent place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hindmarsh also mentioned the committees. The committee work I participated in has been invaluable. All of us can lay claim to various achievements, but I believe that the work of one committee I served on&mdash;and it has been called by various names; today it is the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;has led to some of the most significant achievements regarding the protection and promotion of Australia's natural resources. I mention here the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the opportunities we are given in this place to travel, to expand our knowledge and our horizons. I believe this in itself opens up opportunities for us to serve our people.

I came here in December 1984. Had anyone asked me three or four months before that whether I wanted to become a member of parliament, I would have said no, because for many years I had seen what branch members used to do to my predecessor, Bill Morrison. I am sure we all have them: there are at least three or four people in every branch who think they can do a better job than the member, and at least one or two who think they can do a better job than the Prime Minister. It was never my intention to come here but, as fate would have it, I did. We were very lucky in that our youngest son was 17 years of age at the time, so my wife did not have to become the mother and father, garbage putter-outer and chief cook and bottle washer, as have a lot of the wives and husbands of honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill continues along the same lines as initiatives that were announced by our Government in the 1992-93 Federal Budget. They have been aimed at producing a net benefit for Australia through employment related measures designed to complement and streamline the migration program with an increased emphasis on skills and English proficiency, while retaining priority for family reunion and humanitarian entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key elements of the Government's migration strategy give greater effect to the critical role of English in the settlement through increased emphasis on English in migration selection and additional resources for English as a second language training in Australia. We have seen better targeting of settlement services for migrants, including a focus on established migrant communities that have made such a tremendous contribution to Australia's development. We have ensured that arrangements for onshore asylum seekers have been both fair and compassionate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always necessary to consider the effect of immigration on our country when drafting immigration legislation. The Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill does just that. It scrutinises the effects of persons of ill-repute being allowed to enter our borders and pose a threat to our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that must be considered when drafting immigration legislation is the effect of immigration intakes on our Federal Budget. In a recent report commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration Research it was found that immigrants make a negative contribution to the Commonwealth Government Budget in the short to medium term but a very positive contribution over the longer term. Better targeting of settlement resources has certainly helped Australia retain the long term benefits from immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen major initiatives in this term of the Parliament in the English language area. We have seen those courses being designed to overcome the legacy of policies over the last 30 to 40 years and to prevent a recurrence of those mistakes. In the context of economic restructuring, many older migrants who came here 20 or 30 years ago to help build Australia's industries are now feeling the effect of a lack of English language and employment skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen initiatives over this term of parliament  such as entitlements for newly arrived migrants with less than functional English to obtain up to 510 hours of English language tuition. We have seen an additional $309m being placed in the Budget over four years to help an estimated 48,000 job seekers overcome the English language barrier that stops them from getting work. We have also seen the introduction of limited user charging for new migrants other than preferential family and refugees for their English language tuition, with the revenue to be used to increase English language tuition places in AMEP. All of these have been put into place to ensure that the mistakes of those 40 years ago will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government remains committed to a global non-discriminatory migration program where anyone who can satisfy our selection criteria is a welcome migrant. The Bill before the House is clear evidence of the continuation of this commitment and further refines the basis of Australia's selection criteria for entrance into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recent main points of contention has been the changes to the adult migrant English program under which the maximum of 510 hours of English language tuition was to be made available to migrants. When we convert that 510 hours into months according to a school week, that works out to be approximately five months of training for five days a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to keep reiterating that the great social reforms resulting from these changes to the adult migrant education program is to entitle those who arrive in Australia as migrants or refugees or who are currently in the country to 510 hours of tuition in English at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. It is a very generous response by the Australian community. It seems to me that an increasing number of our migrants to this country expect the Australian Government to support them in more ways than just unemployment benefits. Name me one other country which pays for its migrants to learn its language and funds a vast array of migrant services aimed at helping new arrivals to settle in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues of immigration law are involved, complex and always emotional. I am confident, however, that our Government, in its attempt to streamline the migration program, has retained a sensitive and caring attitude towards the many immigration issues that must be addressed in legislation. It is all about being fair and equitable. I think it is important to emphasise the fact that as long as people try to immigrate to Australia illegally, or through the back door, the laws must be made tighter and stricter to close as many loopholes as possible, and people who are trying to do the right thing and migrate legally are disadvantaged by longer queues and tougher legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the recent High Court decision to deport 16 Cambodian boat people who had been in Australia for three years trying to get refugee status may seem tough, but by the same token these people have not done the right thing by Australia in trying to migrate to this country illegally. The 16 Cambodians now housed in Western Australia's Port Hedland detention centre were among 26 people on a boat which landed at Broome in November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these 16 people had cases which met the United Nations criteria adopted by Australia for refugees. Of the 26 people who arrived on the original boat, two received refugee status, four returned home voluntarily after withdrawing their applications, and decisions were pending on the remaining 10. Each individual case has been investigated by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and these investigations have been necessarily lengthy and meticulous to ensure fair and lawful decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's decision to uphold the right of the Commonwealth Government to detain people who arrive illegally in Australia, including asylum seekers, is to be commended. Why do we make laws in this place if they are to be continually challenged in the courts? I believe that the courts are an important checks and balances system on our laws to an extent, but why then do we have two chambers in this Parliament also checking and balancing every law made in Parliament? Immigration law is necessarily strict in order to protect our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was confirmed earlier this week that a further 89 Cambodian boat people had completed the process of refugee determination and had been formally rejected as refugees, while two others were granted refugee status. These applicants were all part of a group of 119 boat people who landed at Broome in March of 1990. It is important to note that, for those whose claims for refugee status were rejected, it was the second time that they have had their claims examined and the second time that they have been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, our media are very selective in what they report about this issue. Often the fact that Australia has a strong commitment to refugees and a long and proud record of humanitarian assistance is forgotten when those stories are written. After all, the refugee system of determination in Australia is based on that of the United Nations. If people meet the UN criteria for refugee status and are found to be true refugees, they are permitted to stay in Australia. If not, they will have to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Cambodian boat people who have been refused refugee status in Australia have been offered resettlement assistance in line with the practices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Such reintegration assistance is in line with international practice in similar circumstances and is, I believe, both a humanitarian and practical gesture on behalf of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's migration policy strives to strike a proper balance between social and economic targets in the most fair, equitable and sensitive way. The amendments contained in this legislation before the House tonight will continue to contribute to a fair and just system of immigration. In the limited time before me, I too would like to join others in wishing everyone in this House a very merry Christmas and a very healthy and prosperous New Year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the late hour, I will not take up much of the time of the House in relation to the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill. I want to say just a couple of things about it. Before I do so, because this is probably the final meeting of the Parliament before the election, I want also to pay tribute to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for the work which he has done in the last nearly three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations for a few years and have worked with a number of Ministers. Although there has been some publicity from time to time about supposed differences between me and the Minister, the fact is that the Minister has worked very well with the Committee for all of this period, and it would not have been possible to get so much legislation and so many changes through the Caucus and the Parliament without his cooperation with the Committee. Those who try to say that the Minister has not been working with the Committee or with me are mistaken. Naturally, when there are so many issues and concerns, of course there are bound to be some differences, but the reality is that on the overwhelming proportion of things there has been very significant cooperation between us and, in particular, with the whole Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was appointed shortly after the whole regulations approach had been introduced into the immigration portfolio. During that period we had quite a bit of angst about how the whole thing was going to work out. The Minister set out to put some order into the situation and ensure that the regulations approach remained but that it was refined in such a way that it had practical and objective application in the immigration program. I think we have achieved that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have achieved a number of other things under this Minister. We have achieved a complete revolution on the whole question of illegal immigration&mdash;the first really serious tightening-up of illegal immigration&mdash;and in getting rid of rorts in the system with respect to things such as marriage rorts, while at the same time ensuring that in the case of a genuine marriage the partner is allowed to join his or her spouse in Australia. I think we have achieved a very sensible balance on this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One provision which showed the sensitivity of the Minister was the acceptance of a provision suggested by the Migration Regulations Committee to help deal with the unfortunate case of a marriage in which a spouse, usually a woman, is brought into Australia and then subjected to domestic violence. That person is caught in a situation in which she has left the other country to come to an unfortunate position in Australia not of her making. The Minister has introduced a regulation to deal specifically with that sort of case. Even though we wanted to tighten up against rorts, at the same time we wanted to assist people in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years the Minister has overseen a significant transformation of the immigration system. The other thing that he will be remembered for is the consultation which occurred on multicultural issues. There is no doubt that this Party remains firmly committed to multiculturalism. The Minister has preached that message throughout Australia in his consultations. He has been an ambassador for Australia around the world, taking the message of multiculturalism to other countries. Many other countries have a significant interest in Australian multiculturalism. We underrate its importance as a social and cultural policy and as one for which we are increasingly well known throughout the world. Many countries are interested in how the policy works because of the way in which it has created so much tolerance, understanding and harmony in our society. Many countries are envious and are interested in adopting a model similar to the Australian multicultural model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current legislation is another example of our need to have a balance between protecting the Australian nation and giving people rights to enter Australia. This is often the kind of difficult balance that is required in immigration policy. The Minister has put forward a Bill which will give the Minister the power to exclude certain people who have committed offences or whom for several reasons it is undesirable to have in Australia. The kind of person we are thinking about is someone who specialises in preaching messages of hatred and racial tension, someone who wants to promulgate extreme views about violence, or someone who has a criminal record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these rules the Minister will be able to exclude such people. He will make that determination, as the law says, acting personally to refuse or cancel visas or entry permits when, on the basis of information available to the Minister, he or she is satisfied that a person, if permitted to enter or remain in Australia, would be likely to engage in criminal conduct, would represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of it, would engage in vilification of a segment of that community or would foment discord in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this power is not intended to be exercised against people for political motives. It is intended to be exercised in the sorts of cases that I mentioned&mdash;for example, extremists, violent people and people preaching hatred or violence. It is not intended to be used against people who have a political philosophy different from that of the Government or the Opposition or who may have different views on industrial relations or industrial democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those assurances have been given by the Minister to the Committee in relation to the sorts of people who would or would not be excluded. Therefore, I have no problem in supporting the Bill. I think it is a very good balance. It protects the system and, at the same time, gives the Minister the power to act to exclude certain undesirable persons. I support the Bill and wish the Minister well in his retirement. I hope that he will continue to take an interest in immigration and ethnic affairs matters, even after his retirement, and that from time to time we will see him in the Parliament or in the environs of the Parliament. I am sure we will see him participating in migrant and ethnic community events. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bill currently before the House proposes measures concerning conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the ILO. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Insertion of a regulation making power for certain limited purposes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Bill proposes the creation of a regulation making power to enable procedures to be prescribed for the purposes of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144). This convention was adopted by the International Labour Organisation on 21 June 1976 and ratified by Australia on 11 June 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Convention No. 144 requires the Government to consult, at least annually, with the most representative organisations of employers and workers about a variety of matters specified in the convention, including:</PARA>
<PARA>.action proposed in connection with new conventions and recommendations;</PARA>
<PARA>.the re-examination at appropriate intervals of unratified conventions and/or recommendations to which effect has not yet been given, to consider what measures might be taken to promote their implementation and ratification as appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA>.questions arising out of reports to be made to the International Labour Office under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation concerning ratified conventions; and</PARA>
<PARA>.proposals for the denunciation of ratified conventions. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter of particular significance involves questions arising out of reports made to the International Labour Office under article 22 of the ILO Constitution. Under this article, member states are required to report at regular intervals on the current state of relevant law and practice for each convention they have ratified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 22 reports, as they are known, are examined by the ILO's Committee of Experts on the application of conventions and recommendations, which comprises 20 independent persons highly qualified in legal or social fields and with an intimate knowledge of labour conditions or administration. Upon examining an article 22 report, the Committee of Experts can seek further information and can raise issues about Australia's compliance with ratified conventions. This is usually done in the form of a document known as a direct request, which in the case of Australia is addressed to the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the Committee concludes that Australia does not comply with a particular convention, it may request the Government to make appropriate changes to Australian law and practice. Direct requests, and the Government's responses to them, can therefore be very significant. Accordingly, the Government considers it desirable to formalise procedures for the consultation required by Convention No. 144, by the making of appropriate regulations, particularly in respect of the handling of direct requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measures proposed in the Bill are amendments to the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912 to bring Australian law into conformity with two ILO conventions. As honourable members would be aware, the Government is committed to the ratification of International Labour Organisation conventions which are suitable for Australian conditions. Ratification of appropriate ILO conventions is desirable because:</PARA>
<PARA>.it supports and strengthens domestic policy and program initiatives;</PARA>
<PARA>.it confirms and maintains Australia's adherence to international labour standards, with consequent benefits for workers and employers;</PARA>
<PARA>.it lends credibility and authority to our international standing on labour, social and broader human relations matters;</PARA>
<PARA>.it underlines our support for the ILO; and</PARA>
<PARA>.it promotes higher labour standards in the Asian and Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>So far Australia has ratified 51 ILO conventions. In May 1991 the Government established an interdepartmental task force to review some 75 unratified conventions with a view to determining their suitability for ratification and increasing the number of conventions ratified by Australia. These amendments arise from that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a general rule Australia does not ratify a convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the requirements of the convention. The Bill proposes amendments to the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912 which will bring Australian law into conformity with a further two conventions: No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958 and No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946. The proposed amendments will also enable further progress to be made towards achieving compliance with Convention No. 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. Peak employer and union bodies, through the National Labour Consultative Council, have endorsed the suitability of convention Nos 73, 108 and 147 to Australian conditions and the desirability of their ratification. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Migration Act are contained in part 2 of the Bill and are designed to bring Australian law into compliance with the requirements of Convention No. 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958. This convention has been examined by the ILO conventions task force, in conjunction with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and has been classified as a suitable convention for ratification by Australia. The convention is one that is solely within the competence of the Commonwealth Government and does not require any action by the States and Territories to achieve compliance with its provisions. </PARA>

However, the Act currently specifies that a seafarer's identity document is to be held by the master of the vessel or the officer in charge of a resources or sea installation. The amendments to the Act are designed to bring Australian law into full compliance with the convention by providing that a seafarer's identity document is to remain in his or her possession at all times. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 are contained in part 3 of the Bill. They are intended to facilitate the ratification of ILO Convention No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946 and to establish substantial equivalence with article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. Convention No. 73 applies to seagoing ships and provides that seafarers shall not be employed on a vessel to which the convention applies unless each seafarer holds a certificate attesting to his or her fitness for the work at sea for which that person is employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most seagoing ships in Australian waters are engaged in interstate or overseas voyages. They thereby come within Commonwealth jurisdiction and are covered by the provisions of the Navigation Act. A small number of seagoing ships, however, fall within the jurisdiction of a State or Territory. The proposed amendment, which has been developed in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, will enable regulations and orders to be made under the Navigation Act to give effect to the convention in respect of all seagoing ships in Australian waters. The Bill provides that such orders and regulations will not, however, apply to the extent that any existing or future law of a State or the Northern Territory gives effect to the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the proposed amendments to the Navigation Act will amend sections 117 and 118 to enable Australia to establish substantial equivalence with article 5 of Convention No. 68, Food and Catering (Ships Crews), 1946. This is required if Australia is to ratify Convention No. 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. Convention No. 147 is the principal ILO convention dealing with maritime labour matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Convention No. 147, amongst other things, provides that compliance or substantial equivalence must be established with the conventions or articles of conventions specified in the appendix to that convention. Article 5 of Convention No. 68 is specified in that appendix. The proposed amendments will ensure that a ship is carrying water of suitable quantity and quality and also food of suitable quality, quantity, nutritive value and variety for the crew of a vessel.

As the Minister indicated in his second reading speech, this Bill is designed to give effect to some fairly inconsequential amendments to the Migration Act and also to the Navigation Act pursuant to Australia's obligations under some ILO conventions to which we have adhered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take the time of the House in making a long speech about the detailed provisions of the Bill but, because reliance upon ILO conventions is much in the news at present, I thought I would take the opportunity in speaking in the second reading debate on this Bill to say something in broad terms about the announced intention of the Government to rely upon the external affairs power in the Constitution to purport to legislate to impose certain national standards in the area of industrial relations pursuant to obligations assumed to exist under ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state on behalf of the Opposition that we regard it as a wholly undesirable constitutional practice for the external affairs power of the Commonwealth Constitution to be used in order to alter the internal power balance between the Commonwealth and the States within the Commonwealth of Australia. I would say to the Government that, if it wants to alter that power balance, let it have the courage to ask the Australian people at a referendum to do so. If I can be completely contemporary when it comes to constitutional courage, I ask why, if the Government wants to remove references to Her Majesty from oaths of allegiance, it does not have the guts to invite the Australian people to have a vote on matters relating to her constitutional position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same principle applies to the use of the external affairs power. If the Government wants to alter the internal balance, why does it not ask the people of Australia to refer the power to the Commonwealth Parliament? Why does it use the external affairs power that was never intended to be used for other than the external affairs of this country to alter the internal balance?  That is why, since the dam case&mdash;in some learned article I read the other day it was incorrectly called the dams case&mdash;we have argued consistently that the external affairs power ought not be used in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the Government threatening to do exactly the same thing, threatening to say, `Well, we are going to use the external affairs power in order to impose our will on industrial relations'. I think that is an illicit use of the external affairs power. I do not mind all the other powers of the Commonwealth Parliament being used in relation to industrial relations, and I put it on record that I am in favour of using, for example, the corporations power, if necessary. I see no problem with that. But the external affairs power of the Constitution was put there by the founding fathers to regulate the external relations of this country, in other words, the relations between Australia and other nations, not the relations and the power balance between Australia and the several States of Australia. I am no raving States rightist. I think that State provincialism has done this country a great deal of harm, but I do not believe that the Government should use the external affairs power to subvert the design of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reference to the other matter I raised, I think that, if people want to delete references to the head of state from oaths of allegiance and pursue that kind of republicanism by stealth, they ought to have the courage to confront people with referenda, rather than adopting that kind of approach. Of a similar ilk is what the Government is proposing to do in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to delay the House any further on this measure. I have quite a lot to say on the measure which is next listed and which goes to the very heart of the industrial relations debate in this country. What the Keating Government is on about is denying the workers of Victoria the freedom of choice that has been given to them by the newly elected coalition Government of that State. Let me say that, on the principal guts of the Bill, I am quite happy for it to go through, as long as those opposite understand that we think they are indulging in a rather gutless use of the external affairs power, an improper use, an illicit use, a use that we cannot possibly support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, this is quite significant legislation. Although people keep saying that they are only amendments and, more or less, tidying up, it is very important that Australia continue with its progress in ratifying ILO conventions. It becomes even more important today when we look at some of the matters being ratified, such as carrying adequate water on ships and various other things to do with conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to say today, but, actually, as the hour is so late, it was yesterday that a very important report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> was presented by my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). I am a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure which prepared this report. Only two weeks ago the Committee was talking about one of the regulations that it proposed. That is that the Federal Government deny entry to Australian waters to ships which do not meet ILO Convention No. 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions. That was fine until we realised that Australia had actually not ratified ILO Convention No. 147. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were in the difficult situation of saying that foreign vessels which were coming to Australia would have to meet ILO 147 standards, which at that time Australia had not ratified. We knew the legislation was before the Parliament. We did not realise that it would actually come to the Parliament the same day that the Committee's report would be presented. In the report, we say that legislation is before the Parliament and we urge the Government to speedily pass the legislation. Indeed, one of the recommendations is that the Government speedily adhere to or ratify ILO Convention 147. I guess that would set a record. This is the quickest period in which a committee of this Parliament has made a recommendation to the Federal Government and, within hours of that recommendation being made by the Committee, the Government has acceded to the wish of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report will be known, I guess, as the Morris report. The Committee is recommending to the Government that, if foreign ships come here and they do not meet ILO 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions, they be denied the right to trade in Australian waters. The majority of ships that come to Australia are in very good condition, but a minority are not. The ratification by Australia of this convention will result in a continuing ongoing program to make sure that ships that come here do meet international conventions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight, like my colleagues, to support this legislation. I want to make a few points in passing. We talk about International Labour Organisation conventions. It is my belief that the use of those conventions through the external affairs power of the Constitution in order to re-regulate our industrial relations system will be a highly inappropriate use, both of those conventions and of the external affairs powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an indictment, I think, of this Government that, in these dying days of this Government, it finds it so necessary to try to re-establish and re-regulate the system that it talks so eloquently about during Question Time. The labour  market is a very important issue in Australia today. It is important in the sense that we have, in the true sense of the word, started to leave the Fortress Australia concept. We have started to internationalise our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given full credit&mdash;and I will again&mdash;to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for continuing with the deregulation of the financial system and the deregulation of the money market. But this Government has not had the will, nor the capacity, to deal with the labour market. This Government, through its mates, has been, is and will be in the future in partnership with trade union bureaucracies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has not the will or the capacity to break that bond which creates the bureaucracy which holds up the whole system. If we want an international economy, if we truly want to compete with the rest of the world&mdash;if we want factories which make things and which can compete with other countries&mdash;and if we are to address our serious balance of payments problem, we must, at the end of the day, address this question. I remind honourable members that Australia is now virtually alone in the world in terms of having a highly structured, regulated labour market controlled still by the club: the big unions, the big employer organisations and, the grand-daddy of them all, the AIRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the April 1991 national wage case decision came down, the Government, Bill Kelty and the ACTU moved heaven and earth to try to discredit the AIRC and the commissioners themselves. They said all manner of horrible things about those people. They denigrated them, they ridiculed them and they brought them into disrepute. But the shackles of the club bureaucracy must be broken if we are ever to become competitive. Yet this Government now wants to re-regulate: to give back to the AIRC the power that over the life of this Parliament I have seen stripped, Bill by Bill and piece of legislation by piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not only taken away the community's regard for the AIRC, but also destroyed its concept of itself as being an independent body. We have done that through destroying also the credibility of the Remuneration Tribunal. There is no question that our industry will not become competitive and give us jobs and we will not build a better Australia&mdash;an Australia where our children have a future&mdash;unless we finally give away this concept that we can regulate the wage market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that we would make no attempt to regulate truly the prices of goods and services in our economy. We have tried it from time to time. We have tried to fix the prices of goods and we have always failed because free markets will not work under the control of regulated prices. Yet we allow the club system to control the prices of wages and the conditions of work in the labour market. We think we can, through monopoly control, provide fairness to the community and fairness to individual workers. In fact, we are limiting their horizons, limiting their prospects and limiting the ability of business to respond to the competitive pressures of the market, both here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the walls of Fortress Australia have come down and we have become not an isolated island continent in the south-east Pacific, but a truly international economy with a dollar exposed to all the vagaries of the world marketplace, with high speed communications operating in micro-seconds to tell us what is happening in the rest of the world, the rest of the world has put pressures on us and we are responding very poorly to those pressures. That is seen nowhere more vividly than in our rising debt, now standing at $162 billion and increasing at about $1.5 billion per month. We have one million unemployed and almost 700,000 young people do not have a parent who has a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government which announces, `We're going to take on the State of Victoria and we're going to use an international bureaucratic treaty of conventions made up by bureaucrats to re-regulate the wages system in Australia'. That is not only inappropriate, but frightening. It is frightening for my children. I am frightened to death that there will not be jobs for them. I have two children who left the school market this month. They are not sure what they will be doing next month. One of them is trying to get back into school and the other will pick mangoes in North Queensland for a while and then perhaps try school. He wants a full time job, but there are not any jobs for my son. Thirty-five per cent of kids in my son's age bracket in the State of Victoria cannot find jobs. They are kids who want jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have a government that wants to control the labour market. Through the bidding of its masters down at Trades Hall&mdash;the ACTU&mdash;it says that youth wages must be the same as adult wages because they must be doing the same job. What we are really trying to bring in through this ILO convention is the idea of uniformity: equal pay for equal work, regardless of how or what it is for. I think it is appropriate that we think about that concept and about ILO conventions. They are international&mdash;and we emphasise the word `international'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about it in context. If a shoemaker in the State of Victoria is on $500 per week and a shoemaker in China is on $50 per week, perhaps we had better lower the wages of the shoemaker in Victoria to the $50 per week of the bloke in China. Or do we in fact make it the $700 per week that is paid to the shoemaker in northern Italy? What do we do? How do we internationalise and re-regulate our labour market so that we have absolute wage relativity which is comparable in an international sense using these international conventions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear no answer from the other side. There will not be any because it is a conundrum without an answer. We cannot do that; it is absolute silliness. It is the epitome of nonsense to consider that we can describe, define and classify the work that an individual in some location in Australia does and compare him or her to the work that someone else does in some other country. It is just a bunch of nonsense for us to try to describe that same situation for an individual in Canberra versus an individual in Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed use of conventions is certainly a straight-out attack not only on the States and our concept of States rights&mdash;which I remind honourable members are enshrined in the Constitution&mdash;but also on the intent of the Constitution. The Constitution specified some powers in relation to settling industrial disputes. But the proposed use of this convention is an attack on that system because it says that the Federal Government shall have the right to control what the States do of their own free will and volition, being freely elected by their constituents. This Government will impose its will on them&mdash;full stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not in a manner of cooperation, nationhood or agreement, but in a manner of control for politics sake. That is what this is: a political stunt. It is a stunt to try to impose the will of a Prime Minister, who is almost violent at times, who thinks that his will in this matter transcends the rights of Australian people&mdash;their right to select a government and to make rules and regulations for their States. He thinks he has the right to override their will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am totally opposed to the use of international conventions in this manner. This Government has sought to use the external affairs power of the Constitution to run roughshod over States rights in an environmental issue for political purposes in order to help win an election. If we examine it, the proposed use of the convention is, in essence, an attempt to make union dominance and control of the system immutable. By the time we have finished with this proposed legislation, union control will be absolute and the rights of the individual will be of no consequence whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government that is so intent on retaining power, so hungry for power and so absolutely determined that its relationship with the trade union bureaucracy will not be broken that it is willing to do anything, make any suggestion and pass any law, to make sure that that bond is not broken. I could speak at great length on this Bill, but it has been a long night and there is a long way to go. I suggest that this proposed use of international conventions in order to control and re-regulate the industrial relations system in Australia is inappropriate, unwanted and undemocratic. </PARA>

<PARA>The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 is a portfolio Bill which amends 10 Acts in the industrial relations portfolio. The most significant amendments relate to section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposals concerning section 111 reflect our clear policy in industrial relations. We support cooperation over conflict, choice over coercion, and the proper protection of the interests of employers, workers and the general community. Such an approach provides the basis for achieving lasting economic and industrial reform fairly and flexibly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia's industrial relations system is to meet these objectives, it must guarantee employers, employees and their representatives that where agreement cannot be reached over industrial differences, there is a fair, speedy and impartial system for resolving such problems. For most of this century, this has been achieved at the Federal and State levels by the provision of a system of conciliation and arbitration, administered by independent industrial tribunals with the power to compel parties to disputes to appear before them, and to make binding awards, by arbitration if necessary, to resolve the matters in dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system has provided the basis for the fair and effective prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Importantly, through awards, employees are guaranteed enforceable and equitable terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance between Federal and State systems has been maintained partly by the preferences of the parties, partly by historical influences and partly by a mechanism in the Federal industrial legislation which allows the Federal commission not to hear a matter which is appropriately left for resolution by a State industrial tribunal. In the Industrial Relations Act, that mechanism is found in paragraph 111(1)(g). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that paragraph, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter on various grounds, including that the Commission should defer to a State industrial authority, or that further proceedings are not necessary or desirable in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, the Commission acts under this provision without further hearing a matter. In this way, the Commission can leave the matter to be resolved within a State's jurisdiction if that appears to be more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter should not be so dismissed where the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by the exercise of powers of compulsory arbitration in the relevant State jurisdiction in cases in which no other resolution can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Commission should be able to dismiss a matter if it is merely an attempt to re-open an industrial agreement freely entered into by the parties in a State jurisdiction that permitted access to compulsory arbitration. Nor should a temporary denial of access to compulsory arbitration be relevant, if it is the result of an award that was made within a system of compulsory arbitration. The proposed amendments recognise these situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, it is proposed to provide that the Commission may not dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter where compulsory arbitration cannot apply or could not have applied in the State concerned. Without such amendments, industrial disputes within the constitutionally authorised jurisdiction of the Commission could be left unresolved, and one party or another could be in a position to impose an unfair result by using much greater bargaining power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that the proposed amendments do not direct the Commission how to decide any matter to which they apply. Their effect will be to ensure that the Commission hears and decides such a matter on its merits, and that it cannot be dismissed without such a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government referred the proposed amendments to the National Labour Consultative Council and to State governments for their consideration and comment. The views of the National Labour Consultative Council members have been taken into account, resulting in some changes to the original draft amendments. A clause has been omitted which would have imposed an obligation on federally registered employer organisations to give notice of changes in their membership to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and relevant unions. Such changes in membership can affect respondency to awards. The proposal has been removed for further examination by the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States were given the opportunity to comment on the Government's proposals. The governments of two States, New South Wales and Queensland, provided substantive comments. The representations led to some changes to the draft Bill. Proposed subsection 111(1a) has been altered to make it clear that State awards which cannot, for some period, be varied, are outside the proposed restriction on the powers under paragraph 111(1)(g). In addition, the Bill is framed so that `employment agreements' as defined are also outside that restriction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of these governments related to awards and agreements under their own industrial legislation, but are also relevant to other State systems which maintain compulsory arbitration as an ultimate means of determining disputes. The status quo under paragraph 111(1)(g) has been preserved in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Government also suggested that paragraph 111(1)(g) should itself be amended by inserting an express provision to allow the Commission to dismiss or to refrain from further hearing a matter where it has been the subject under State law of an employment agreement, as defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth recognises the validity of this point and proposes to raise it in the National Labour Consultative Council and with the other States, to seek their views on amending section 111 appropriately. This will occur before the next sittings of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments in this Bill are all designed to improve the operation of the Acts concerned or the functioning of offices or bodies established under them. Each of the proposed amendments is sensible and of real value. They have been the subject of discussion in the tripartite National Labour Consultative Council and accepted by its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains two further amendments to the Industrial Relations Act which should be mentioned. The first is to improve the operation of section 202 of the Act, to strengthen the administration of federally registered unions. Section 202 is designed to overcome difficulties that can occur when a Federal union and a State union have substantially overlapping membership. The section allows a Federal union to enter into an agreement with a counterpart State union. Members of the State union who are not within the Federal union's eligibility rules can then become members of the Federal union and participate in its internal affairs. The Federal union cannot represent the industrial interests of these members unless it successfully goes through the normal process, required by other provisions of the Act, to make the changes to its eligibility rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 202 provides a way of overcoming legal difficulties that might arise from the participation by the State union members in the affairs of the Federal union.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing section 202 is confined to States which have legislation that confers corporate status on registered unions. Experience has shown that the section could usefully be extended to unions in the other two States&mdash;Victoria and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new section 202 provides for this, and will also permit an agreement to be used to facilitate amalgamations between federally registered unions. To avoid abuses, the new provision gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission greater powers of supervision over agreements made under the section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new section 202 remains a provision concerned with the rights of members to participate in the internal affairs of a federally registered union. It does not give such a union any additional rights to represent those members industrially. For these purposes, a federally registered union is limited by its eligibility rules, which will not be affected by an agreement under section 202. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the protection of the law of contempt of court. It will be an offence to do anything that would amount to contempt of court if the Commission were itself a court. Commonwealth law already gives this same protection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Trade Practices Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new provision will replace a broader provision in a paragraph of section 299 which the High Court has recently found to be invalid. The High Court interpreted that provision as purporting to prohibit criticism of the Commission even when that criticism was honest and fair. The new provision will not suffer from that defect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this new provision, the genuine exercise of a right of criticism will not be an offence. The new provision will apply only if a person is acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes minor changes to legislation concerning occupational health and safety, Commonwealth employment and the membership of the Remuneration Tribunal. These are explained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

It is a very important measure and it has enormous consequences for the industrial relations system of this country. It is a proposal by the Keating Labor Government that strikes right at the concept of any notion of electoral mandate in this country. Let us make one thing very clear at the outset. It is the dying hours of this Parliament and, in a sense, it is a disgrace that a measure as important as this should be brought before the Parliament at five past one on the last morning that it may sit. This Bill is not about giving greater choice to the workers of Victoria; it is about taking away choice from the workers of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) had the impertinence in his second reading speech, the sheer and unadulterated gall, to say that this is about choice over coercion. Let me tell the House how it is the exact reverse. If this Bill is passed, it is the coercion of this Federal Parliament over the free choice of the Victorian people, expressed at a recent State election, and the free choice of individual Victorian workers to go into workplace agreements under legislation enacted by the Victorian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will enable any group of trade union officials in Victoria to apply for Federal industrial relations award coverage in relation to any work category in the State of Victoria. Irrespective of the wishes of people who may be working in that classification, if that award coverage is granted, then individual Victorian workers, often against their will, will be dragged out of those workplace agreements and put under Federal awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not about allowing individual Victorian workers to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for Federal award coverage. Every time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that, he distorts the truth and misrepresents the position. This Bill is about giving the union bosses of Victoria the power once again to assume control over what individual Victorian workers&mdash;many not belonging to those unions&mdash;want to do with their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sit here and watch the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who has a background in the trade union movement, and I watch other honourable members opposite. I invite them as part of this debate to disprove the central claim that I am making: are they arguing that this Bill gives individual workers the right to apply for Federal award coverage? I notice that they do not nod their heads, because they cannot. They know that what I am saying is correct. This Bill is about one thing only: placating John Halfpenny, the surrender of Paul Keating to John Halfpenny, and overturning the decision taken by the people of Victoria on 3 October to vote into power a government that has been given an explicit mandate to legislate to change the industrial relations laws of the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the change of government in Victoria the industrial relations law of Victoria has been dramatically altered in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Victorian people on 3 October. The major change that has been made in Victoria is that, for the first time in over 90 years, individual men and women, subject to compliance with a number of minimum conditions, have been given the freedom to negotiate directly with their own employers and to enter directly into workplace agreements. This Bill seeks to overturn that freedom. This Bill is not about giving greater freedom; it is about circumscribing the freedom that has been given to the workers of Victoria. We have had this debate before and I see the same friendly faces opposite. </PARA>

I say to the honourable member for Hinkler and to other honourable members opposite that this Bill is about one very simple proposition: are we, in 1992, going to support the proposition that it is trade union officials, and not the individuals concerned, who have the right to decide who is going to govern the enterprise and workplace arrangements of individual Australians?

I will be delighted to spend the next few months debating whether the men and women of Australia should have the freedom to negotiate on their own behalf if they want to. We are not saying to anybody opposite that people should not have the right to negotiate through a union if they want to. There is nothing in the Federal coalition's industrial relations policy that denies people the right to use a trade union. They can use anybody they like. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government talks about the pride and the independence of the Australian people but, when it comes to the crunch, it will never allow them to negotiate on their own behalf&mdash;they are too dumb; they are too stupid. We apparently allow people to make monumental financial decisions about the house they will buy; we allow people to decide who they are going to marry or live with; we allow people to make all sorts of decisions of that kind without some kind of paternal influence, but when it comes to entering into an arrangement about how much they are worth, we say, `Oh, you can't do that; you can't actually allow people to make a decision on their own behalf; they might get it wrong'. So we are going to stop them doing it. We are going to bind them hand and foot and we are going to say in the good old paternalistic, totalitarian Labor tradition, `You shall not be allowed'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has nothing to do with good industrial relations. It has everything to do with reasserting the authority of the Trades Hall Council; it has everything to do with handing over to the union bosses of Victoria the right to decide that Victorian workers who, of their own free will, have gone into workplace agreements shall be dragged out of those workplace agreements and placed under Federal awards. There is nothing that can be pointed to in this Bill that disputes the simple, unassailable proposition that no individual Victorian worker has the right, under this legislation, to obtain Federal award coverage. </PARA>

It is not about giving individuals rights; it is about giving trade union bosses rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell from the reaction by the honourable member for Reid that he knows exactly what I am about to say. The honourable member for Reid knows a few things about industrial relations. He has a reasonable memory. He would remember that three years ago Bob Hawke thought common law was the greatest thing since sliced bread when it came to industrial relations. In the wake of the pilots dispute, Bob Hawke encouraged Sir Peter Abeles and Ted Harris to get their airlines to sue the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots. He stood by and applauded while common law was used by the airlines of Australia to recover damages against Australian trade unionists. There is nothing that any of those opposite can do that will ever erase from the collective memory of the Australian people on industrial relations the fact that, when it came to the crunch and when it suited their political convenience, Bob Hawke, the then Treasurer and Bill Kelty embraced the use of common law procedures, common law arrangements and the recovery of common law damages with great zeal and with great gusto. Therefore, it is a monumental act of hypocrisy and humbug for the present Prime Minister of Australia and any of his acolytes, current or continuing, to argue that in some way there is something dreadful or nefarious about the use of common law because, when it suited those opposite, common law was the thing to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other peculiar thing about the common law and the Government's condemnation of its use is a very interesting comparison, so far as common law liability is concerned. It arises under the Opposition's policy according to whether one is under an award or under a workplace agreement. I wonder how many honourable members opposite know that under our policy if one continues under an award as an individual employee one's potential liability, or exposure at common law, for damages is completely unlimited as the Federation of Airline Pilots discovered and as the honourable member for Brisbane by his nodding head acknowledges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes into a workplace agreement one's liability at common law is limited to a total amount of $5,000 per individual. In other words, one's liability at common law is infinitely less under a workplace agreement than it is under the Keating-Kelty system that honourable members opposite are trying to defend and protect. Is that not an interesting irony? Yet, what do honourable members say about that? What they say about that is a very simple proposition: we limit the common law damages to $5,000 a head; they, with their twisted sense of respect for the truth, turn around in all of their publications and say that that equals a fine of $5,000 if anybody goes on strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are those opposite seriously arguing that that is a truthful statement of the position? Those opposite want a serious debate on industrial relations in Australia, yet they are prepared to give their authority, warrant and support to that kind of deceitful misrepresentation to the Australian people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no difference in principle between what happened in the airlines case and what might happen in another situation. It was the Government's Prime Minister, its Treasurer and its mate who runs the ACTU who were in favour of taking the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots to court. The Federation was sued and there were damages of $6m awarded against those pilots. It was the Government's Prime Minister that clapped and cheered while that occurred. He rubbed his hands together and said, `That's terrific'. He wanted that to happen. He wanted them to be made an example of.

Yet those opposite are seriously asking the Australian people to accept that this is an exercise in free choice. What those opposite are about is running a completely dishonest fear campaign on the subject of industrial relations. What they are about is running a campaign of fear and loathing. They are not about a serious debate on industrial relations. They are not about lifting productivity and they are not about recognising that productivity has been an abysmal failure under the industrial relations system that they operate. </PARA>

There are many people on the other side of the House who refer to all this debate about freedom. It was perceived under the Eisenhower Administration that at that time in the early 1960s, at the beginning of the Cold War debate, America was a free country. Of course it was free. The people were free to starve, as they are today. They were free to miss out on education, health and housing, as they are today. A total of 38 million people in America are homeless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the freedom that we recognise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that those people on the other side get upset about working men and women fighting for their rights. The real difference is that workers do not have a Geelong Grammar school tie; they do not have a Melbourne Grammar school tie. They do not come from the yuppie suburbs of Vaucluse and Toorak. But they have more to contribute to this country than the hillbillies who come out of those suburbs and the blue rinse set who have never contributed anything other than the McEwen monkey that rode on the back of Australian industry, the Menzies liability that we saw for so many years and, of course, the lack of courage in the war when they put that red line through Brisbane and said, `We'll give it all away to the Japanese'. </PARA>

Those on the other side of the House are defending the free enterprise that they talk about&mdash;the freedom for exploitation, the freedom to take money out of the pockets of workers, the freedom to tell young people that they can work for $3 an hour, the freedom to abolish the CES, the freedom to abolish the TAFE system and the freedom to abolish the education system&mdash;the very thing that allows people to get up the ladder and to get equality. The freedom will disappear and ensure that only the wealthy and the lucky ever endure and ever succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the debate is about. It is a philosophical debate. I am very pleased that this debate has finally hinged on the difference between both sides of this House. Over the last 20 years, both sides of the House have concentrated on panache, on scenarios, on dress and all the razzamatazz that has gone along with elections. But the election that is coming up will be based on the most important thing of all, and it will be the most important election since the war. It will be based on philosophy&mdash;not on clothes, not on charisma, not on all the things the other elections have been based on, when there have been only varying degrees of difference. There will be a clear distinction in this election between those people who support the view that working people in this country deserve a fair go and deserve protection, and those people who believe in a free market economy and who believe that people are free to starve, free to live in the streets and free to sleep in the gutters. That is the difference in this society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite want to parrot that line, why would they want to put a tax of 15 per cent on the very people they pretend to care about? It is because they do not care about them. They can personify and pontificate, but they do not care about them&mdash;they never have and they never will&mdash;because they do not come from that area. They come from the people who have been the masters when it comes to wealth and privilege. At the end of the day, they are really talking about a division between Australians. That is what they are representing. I think it would be sad if this country went back down the tracks of what happened between 1929 and 1932 or 1891 and 1893. </PARA>

There have been people on his side of the House who have been less honest, but he has been honest and consistent all the way along the line. What he really means is that working people do not have an independent umpire, do not have the protection of awards and do not have the systems that Australia created and has led the world in for 100 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise to make my contribution to the hotchpotch of amendments to the Government's Industrial Relations Act 1988. I consider the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 to be in two parts. The first part of the Bill is the Bob Charles, member for La Trobe, vindication Bill; the second part of the Bill should really be known as the `Attack Jeff Kennett' Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the Bill&mdash;the Bob Charles vindication Bill&mdash;is all about removing section 299(1)(d)(ii) from the Industrial Relations Act. I first brought that measure before this House in a private member's Bill on 4 November 1990. Three times I brought a Bill before this House to eliminate an obnoxious section of an Act that had carried over from the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 and which has been enshrined in legislation since 1904. I contended that it was a violation of freedom of the press and freedom of speech and was noxious to the Constitution of the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that the High Court in its judgment said that I was right and the Government was wrong&mdash;wrong, wrong, wrong. Three times in two years I brought a Bill before this House to convince the Government that that section of the Act should be expunged. Three times I was denied. However, the High Court did not deny me; the High Court said that I was right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite that that section of the Act has largely been used by that side of the House to attack the press in this country and to remove from it a basic freedom: to discuss public affairs openly and honestly so that we have free and fair discussion. The Labor Party does not like that and so it refused to remove that section. We have in this Bill, unfortunately, a removal of that section of the Act, but the substitution of other words, which provide some other form of protection to the Commission, and which treat the Commission as if it were a court of law&mdash;but it is not. The Industrial Relations Commission is a tribunal; it is not a court. We do not have a court of labour law in this country, and I hope we never will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is determined to proceed with this legislation. That is why we are debating it in this House tonight. In April 1991, when the Industrial Relations Commission knocked back the ACTU and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) on a stitched-up deal known as accord mark 6, all those on that side of the House went into spasm. They attacked the Commission and the commissioners and some quite vitriolic things were said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, Bill Kelty said that it was a sickening decision and that the trade union movement did not have to eat the vomit. That did not offend section 299 and did not bring the Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. I maintain that, by constant attack over the past few years, the Labor Party has brought the Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, through the second part of this Bill, intends to reinforce the powers of the Commission, to give it wider scope and to bring it under further union control in order to recentralise industrial relations in Australia. Earlier this year the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 come through this place. It was known as the contractor's Bill. That Bill did three things to the Industrial Relations Act. The first was to remove the public interest test from the Commission's ability to look at so-called special deals. In this new found Labor philosophy of enterprise bargaining&mdash;rhetoric on the Labor side which, I might say, was picked up from our side of the House but without the substance&mdash;the changes to the Act made under the contractor's Bill removed the public interest test. The commissioners do not have to pay any regard to what is good for Australia or good for Australians, only what is good for the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that only some 40 per cent of the work force in this country are represented by trade union membership. Yet we continue to add to the regulation in this Act, giving the Commission the power to deal not with the 60 per cent of individual Australians who do not belong to trade unions but with all Australians only through trade unions. We give trade unions monopolistic powers through this Bill that are available to no other Australian under any other circumstances. We have legislation to make sure that companies do not achieve monopoly status. It is only trade unions which have monopoly rights in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the contractors Bill dealt with contracts of employment. It said that the Commission has the right to enter into legal contracts in the community and to determine whether or not they are fair. The conditions of fairness relate entirely to whether or not a contract of employment offers a contractor conditions which are different than had that individual been an employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many instances throughout industry where contractors provide services because they want to work in a free and cooperative environment. They want to be their own small business people&mdash;not under union control, not under the control of the Industrial Relations Commission and not as employees of a company who must report to work at one hour and leave at another. They like being contractors. The harder they work, the more money they earn; the more hours they work, the more money they earn. They like that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the housing industry in the State of Victoria, a bricklayer who works as a subcontractor to build a house can expect to receive $360 or $370 per 1,000 for laying bricks. But if that bricklayer is employed to lay bricks at a school, a hospital or a church under the so-called `no ticket, no start' regime of the major construction industry, he lays the same brick in the same order for about $700 per 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of the contractor's amendment to the Industrial Relations Act, if a union comes along and says, `That bloke laying the bricks on the house is being exploited', the Commission has the right to change the contract and make the contractor who is building the house pay the bricklayer $700 per 1,000. What is the difference between the brick and the mortar? The difference is, on the one hand, a freely operating independent contractor and, on the other hand, a contractor controlled by union regulations and rules, not by any requirements of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the contractors Bill said that individuals have no rights before the Commission, that the Commission is to hear and make dispute resolution decisions based on applications made by trade unions&mdash;a recognised monopoly power given further credence in legislation denying any rights to individuals to decide what is best for them or what they might want. So we create this huge bureaucracy that sets up volume after volume of rule and regulation, which attempts to prescribe working conditions, payments and all manner of how an individual shall work at a job, depending on that person's classification, as decided by the union structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of this Bill is the so-called `Attack Jeff Kennett Bill'. The new part of these amendments that will come into place if the Government has its way will move Victorians under State awards to Federal jurisdiction. I think that we really ought to look at the fact that Victorians went to the polls on 3 October. Victorians made decisions of their own free will and volition. They elected a new government to run the State of Victoria, pass laws, make rules and make regulations for their benefit. That new Government has done that. This Bill will strip the citizens of Victoria of the rights they exercised at the election on 3 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of this legislation give the monopoly power unions the right now to say to the Federal Commission, `Look, we want everybody who works in a particular job classification that currently falls under a State award to be under a Federal award'. The Commission now will have to take account of that application, because a union has brought it. No individual can make such an application; only a union can make that application. Whether or not the employees at a workplace in Victoria are happy with their lot and whether or not they follow the rules and regulations of the new legislation, and if they freely enter into a new agreement that specifies their employment conditions and their rates of pay, a union outside that workplace will have the right to go to the Federal Commission and say, `The deal is no good because it falls out of the award structure guidelines'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense. Government members know it is a nonsense and I know it is a nonsense. With these amendments we want to re-regulate the industrial relations system in Australia. We talk about flexibility and we talk about individual rights. Government members talk about the need to increase productivity in workplaces in Australia, but they do not mean it. What they really want is to regulate the entire system to give the unions complete power over every workplace in every circumstance, so that everybody is treated equally. It is the Jeff Kennett Attack Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone mad with power and is determined that there will be no more States rights and that individuals in a State who have the audacity to vote into power a Government not of his persuasion will be dealt with immediately and harshly. In 1901 we agreed to a Constitution of federalism. We combined the States under one central body, but left the States their individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this well thought out system that has worked until now reasonably well&mdash;in fact, it has worked so well that I would say that, if anything, Australia is a model for democracy and that our system of parliament in this country could well be echoed by others around the world, if they so had the desire to create a good flexible system. But this Government is not happy with that, because this Government does not believe in States rights. This Prime Minister believes in only one thing: one man for one job to control one nation and everybody in it. He certainly is making that obvious through the provisions of the second part of this Bill, which take away the rights of Victorians, bring them under federal control, and make sure that unions have the monopoly rights to control the entire system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that honourable members on the other side of the House have a great desire to take us back to Fortress Australia. We know that if we are ever going to be internationally competitive, if we are ever to have any hope of creating new jobs, we have to deregulate the labor market, not re-regulate it, not bring in new inflexible controls and more bureaucracy.

That is what it is about. It is not about a fair deal for working men and women. It is not about a fair deal or a fair wage for a fair day's work. It is all about making sure that the unions hang onto their power, so that this Government has the financial base to allow it to run television advertising at the next election campaign. Without that financial base, the Government is finished. Government members know that they are finished. They have no hope of explaining what poor, miserable position they might have, and it would be nice if they actually had a platform and could explain to Australians out there what they are going to do to try to get us out of this horrible recession that they caused, that they brought on, and what they are going to do about creating an environment that business and industry will have the confidence to invest in, which is the only way we are ever going to have jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much sense, is there, in building a bigger Government bureaucracy?  There is not even much sense in building a bigger trade union monopoly and bureaucracy, because we will not provide any real jobs out of it. We will not create one dot's worth of wealth.

Not one dot's more of wealth will we create, not one more job will we create so long as we continue to pad the bureaucracy and pad the trade union bureaucracy as well. The Government knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way we are going to get industry to invest is if we tell industry, `Look, you do not any longer have to live by this great raft of prescribed rules. We are going to allow you and your employees to work in a manner that can provide real productivity improvement and which will give you the confidence and the ability to compete with other countries, so that you can sell your products in other places'.

Government members should stand up and tell us about how proud they are of the debt that they have created&mdash;from $23 billion to $162 billion in a little over nine years. The Government has done a terrific job of creating more debt, giving us bigger interest bills to pay, and we are now looking to borrow the money on Bankcard to pay the interest, are we not? We can borrow the money. We can borrow more. We can always have more debt, but all we are doing is feeding the number of unemployed. We are not creating jobs. The Government has no idea how to create jobs. The only way we are going to get industry to invest is if industry can be competitive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably the most incisive point in this debate and why the Opposition feels so passionately about it was well summed up when the Government first announced the proposal which has been incorporated in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The night it was announced a debate occurred on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> between the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I watched that debate very closely because it was certainly the most agitated and the most upset that I had seen the honourable member for Bennelong in my five years in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could see in his eyes and in his face 1987 again. He believes he was robbed of becoming Prime Minister of this country in 1987 by Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his mad `Joh for PM' push. The honourable member believes that the great madness which consumed the conservative side of politics in 1987 stopped him becoming Prime Minister. But in 1992-93 Joh Bjelke-Petersen has been replaced by Jeffrey Kennett. It is exactly the same thing. Absolute madness is occurring on the conservative side of politics. The honourable member for Bennelong could see it then: history was repeating itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this term and for the vast majority of this year the conservatives have been on automatic pilot&mdash;they were going to win the election; it was just a matter of splitting up the spoils. They would make it into office; there was no problem at all. But all of that started to change. It started slowly, but it all came to a head and their support absolutely collapsed the day that Jeff Kennett became Premier of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the conservatives' support collapse? Obviously a bit of it had to do with the unsaleability of the GST package and everything which went with it&mdash;for instance, the idea that one could actually cut government expenditure and pretend that would improve employment at a time when we need a greater financial stimulus in this economy. Obviously it had something to do with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what it all boiled down to was that people perceived in Jeff Kennett the future under a Federal coalition government.

The last speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), said that&mdash;it was out of the mouths of babes. What was the great example he gave in terms of proving that the system and the Government's industrial policy were wrong? He gave the example of the building industry. He said, `Look at the terrible, shocking difference we have here. We have award workers getting something like $700 per thousand bricks and yet we have subcontractors running around getting something like half that&mdash;$360'. He said, `This is terrible. Here we have this terribly regulated labour market and people are actually getting $700 per thousand bricks. If we did not have it they would be getting $360'. He thought that would be a great outcome: people would be paid less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden it has dawned on the Opposition&mdash;or perhaps it has not&mdash;that maybe the Australian people are not terribly keen on that. They do not like the idea of their wages being halved as in the example given by the honourable member of the building industry. We have only to look at the earlier debates about youth wages when those opposite said, `We will cure unemployment by cutting people's wages. We will institute this new system whereby people will be paid minimum amounts'. But maybe people did not really like that. Maybe young people thought there was some value in the concept of equal pay for work of equal value and the fact that people were doing this work at age 18 or 19 did not mean they should necessarily be paid less. Maybe people did not like that idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden the wheels started falling off and support started plummeting. The white flag went up and we had all the meetings at night to go through Fightback version 2, which will be launched tomorrow. But that will not save those opposite. The honourable member for Bennelong made it perfectly clear tonight that there will be no change to the industrial relations policy; it will stay in place. He will not cop any changes to his baby. He will see it through, come hell or high water. But he has seen in Jeff Kennett 1987 again and he knows he will never be given a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is really between a rock and a hard place. Some of his rhetoric is, `The only difference between Jeff Kennett's industrial policies and mine are a few commas, dotted i's and crossed t's'. We hear that version where he is 100 per cent behind what Jeff Kennett is doing. But at other times his rhetoric is, `Well, I'm not really happy with some of the things Jeff has done. It's not really that ethical to go around putting out all your campaign literature and speeches saying "We're not going to cut penalty rates or abolish leave loading or force you out of the award system" and then get into government and do the exact opposite'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member may wonder why people may look at him slightly strangely when he comes out and says, `Well, we're not going to cut penalty rates, abolish leave loadings or force people off awards. And if you get nasty employers we will set up an industrial advocate for you to go to and get some independent advice'. The people saw what Jeff Kennett said and then they saw what he did. It is a case of: do not read my lips, watch my actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the people will do to the honourable member for Bennelong and the Opposition. They will base their decisions on actions. They have seen conservative government in action in Victoria and they know the truth of the situation. They know it is no good relying on what those opposite say, they have to watch what they do. That is why Opposition support has plummeted. People are not stupid. They know that is the end of the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is so wrong with our current industrial relations system? Let us go through the outcomes and ask: where is it so wrong that we have to attack it and destroy it? Firstly, if it were a bad system we would probably have huge numbers of industrial disputes in this country. Literally thousands and thousands of working days would be lost because our industrial relations system is bringing about great conflict in this country. But if we look at the figures, lo and behold, that does not occur at all&mdash;Australia has one of the lowest levels of industrial disputation. In terms of our own experience, it is the lowest figure in some 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we say: maybe something else is wrong. Maybe the industrial relations system is producing wages outcomes which are driving inflation out of control in this country. Maybe we can never be competitive because of our super high inflation rate contributed to by the industrial system. But when we look at the figures what do we find? We do not have rampant inflation in Australia. In fact, we have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, inflation rates in the OECD&mdash;in the industrial world. We can cross that one off our `what is so wrong that we need the radical surgery proposed by the honourable member' list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we might say, `Let us have a look at the wages, the profit share', and say that maybe the system is such that it is producing an outcome which is completely  uneconomic for this country; that wages are taking too great a share and profits are taking too little a share; and that is why there is not the investment that we need. But when we look at the wages to profit share, what do we find? The levels are equivalent to those in the 1960s. There is nothing wrong at all with the wages to profit share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the recession that we had in 1982-83, controlled by the honourable member for Bennelong and his then adviser, the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the wages to profit share was absolutely out of proportion. It was smashed because of the outrageous wages explosion which occurred during that period. We have had no such wages explosion during this period because the Government actually does have an incomes and wages policy. So we have to cross that one off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to this question of productivity, and that is the one that the Opposition is really hanging its hat on. It is saying that our industrial relations system is stifling productivity growth in this country and locking us into unrealistic practices, which is stopping us from harnessing all our initiatives and breaking forth and becoming far more productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback document&mdash;at least the one we have seen; mark 1&mdash;gives the average productivity growth over the last decade of about 0.9 of a per cent. Those opposite say, `That is terrible. It is far too low; we have got to do a lot better than that'. Then they give their modelling of the three scenarios under Fightback: the old high road, low road and middle road. Let us be charitable to the Opposition and assume that it gets the high road scenario and everything falls into place, everything works to perfection and the best possible estimates are achieved. What is the actual model productivity growth in Fightback, version 1? In the high road scenario it is 0.8 per cent growth in productivity&mdash;in fact, lower than the productivity growth which its own document identifies was achieved during the 1980s. So its own policy, of which industrial relations was said to be the central plank, achieves a productivity outcome lower than what the Government achieved during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at the moment we are seeing very high levels of productivity growth in this economy. We have to be realistic about these things. We can all get the catchcry `productivity growth'. But at this time productivity growth means higher unemployment because firms are getting more productivity out of their employees and are requiring fewer employees as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us cut through some of the rhetoric and understand what we are really talking about. We do need higher productivity in this country, but we understand&mdash;and we have to be honest about it&mdash;that that comes at a price of some higher level of unemployment than we would probably like. But that is a consequence. Let us not just talk about the good side of these things; let us also talk about the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then let us talk about employment. Obviously that is the No. 1 issue facing this country. In this Parliament the Government and the Opposition should always be focusing on policies which will improve employment prospects for Australians. We should ask: is the industrial relations system in this country holding back employment growth? Is that the reason why we should be abandoning the current system and being so critical of the proposals contained in this Bill? The fact is that, although Australia obviously has tragically and unacceptably high levels of unemployment&mdash;and we must do everything in our power to address this problem&mdash;in the Australian economy today there are approximately 1.4 million more people in the work force than there were a decade ago. That is incredible. There are 1.4 million more people in the Australian work force than there were a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s was a period of incredible employment growth in this country. Did the industrial relations system hold back employment growth in the 1980s? Were we going backwards in the size of our labour force, as occurred in New Zealand&mdash;the Opposition's model&mdash;where today there are fewer people in the labour force than there were a decade ago? The answer to that obviously has to be no, because there are 1.4 million Australians now in employment who were not in employment back in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the reason for all this? If we have not had high levels of disputation, if we do not have high levels of inflation, if we have an appropriate wages to profit share, if we have reasonable levels of productivity growth, if we have a system which has not held back employment growth, then what is the problem, and what is the real motive of the Opposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it was made very clear by the honourable member for La Trobe through his example from the building industry. At the end of the day, what was being said meant that someone getting $700 under the award was terrible, and if the award were destroyed and the market deregulated the equivalent worker outside award protection would get $360 for the same job. That is the Opposition's preferred outcome. That is, slash that person's wages in half and it is a better outcome. For whom is this better outcome achieved? Is it for that person and the wages being taken home? Is it for that person's family and the people dependent on that person? I would say the answer to that is no. But maybe the people employing the workers and paying them half are getting a little  more: in fact, maybe they are getting a lot more of the cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be concerned with policies that are increasing the size of the cake and not with the sterile policies of the Opposition. Its policies are not about creating wealth and making the cake bigger, but about giving the owners of capital a bigger slice and taking away from the providers of labour. That is the core of the matter when the rhetoric is hunted through and decoded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Opposition believes that Australians are paid too much. It believes that Australia is a high wage country and that it should have a wage system which pays our people far less. It hopes through that that there will be employment growth, but that is not the difficulty with the Australian economy. Everyone knows, from any basic analysis of the economy, that wages are not the problem with the Australian economy: they are not high and conditions are not unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem with our economy at the moment is low levels of demand and people not being confident to invest. The problem is nothing to do with wages, and it is nothing to do with conditions. Yet the Opposition says that the essential focus of its policies, an essential plank of its Fightback&mdash;version 1 or 2 or whatever version it finally takes to the election&mdash;is industrial relations. It is no surprise that support for the Opposition has dropped; it is no surprise that there are 100,000 people on the streets of Victoria; and it is no surprise if people do not believe what the Opposition says. People believe what they see with their own eyes: they believe the outcome, not the rhetoric. That is why the wheels have come off the Opposition's cart and why its support has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong if it thinks it can solve the problem tomorrow by announcing a tarted up version of the GST that takes the tax off food, rejigs a few things and gives a nice new child-care policy. If it thinks that will make it a kinder and gentler alternative in the eyes of the Australian people it is wrong, because people know that the central issue is industrial relations. They know what the outcome of the conservatives' policies will be, because they have seen the same policies in operation in Victoria, policies which mean the taking away of basic conditions and paying people less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cut through the rhetoric, decode it, and that is what the message is. The fact that the cat has been let out of the bag and people have seen it means that we are going to have a repeat of 1987: the election that it was said the conservatives could not lose, that not even the Liberals could lose. But they did and they lost the following one. They are going to lose in 1993 and that knowledge can be seen on their faces now because they have come to realise it themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is sensible legislation. It does not take away rights but extends them to people in Victoria. It improves the system there, and speeds up a process, which has always been available, for transferring from State to Federal awards. It does nothing new; it does not force any particular course of action: it simply opens up courses of action. It is sensible legislation and it should be supported by this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At nearly 3 a.m., with a couple of other Bills still to come before the House and a number of other speakers, I will keep my remarks much briefer than I had earlier intended. I have a couple of comments to make on some of the various economic points in the debate, although `debate' is probably too kind a word to give some of the comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of what has happened with industrial relations and disputes as the economy has improved or worsened, I am afraid the assertions of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) are flatly wrong. I suggest to the honourable member for Gwydir that he have a close look at the figures for unemployment plotted against the industrial disputes through the 1980s. He will discover that, as unemployment fell quite markedly on the election of a Labor government in 1983 and through to about 1987, industrial disputes also fell quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion the Opposition makes that there has been a record low level of industrial disputation simply because the economy has in the last year or so been in a difficult period with the recession is not borne out by an examination of the facts. Those honourable members opposite who were at pains to talk about telling the truth in some of the earlier debates might like to have a look at the figures in relation to their own assertions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A focus in this debate, quite understandably given the nature of the legislation, is  what in fact the people of Victoria may or may not have been seeking to do when the Kennett Government was elected. The Opposition has really focused on two things: freedom of choice and States rights. Under the States rights umbrella, the Opposition has referred to the people of Victoria having made a decision to elect a Kennett government with a mandate to do the things it has done. It is about time that was put to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign, the Liberal Party distributed a pamphlet entitled `Your employment rights'. That pamphlet said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No person in employment will suffer any loss of award wages or conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>The promise of the Liberals to the people of Victoria was that no person in employment would suffer any loss of award wages or conditions. They got quite explicit later in the pamphlet. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . every worker who does not voluntarily enter into a contract with his or her employer will not lose a cent in salary, overtime, penalty rates or shift rates or any other prescribed current award entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA>They illustrated the point quite clearly and then, a matter of days after they got into office, introduced legislation to do precisely what they promised the people of Victoria in black and white, in the literature the Liberal Party distributed, they would not do. There is absolutely no doubt at all that the Liberal Party in Victoria conducted a fraud, a deceitful campaign, on the workers of that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put plainly, they lied to the people of Victoria through their teeth and they did it in black and white, and they have been caught out. For any member of the Liberal Party in this place to stand up and try to tell us that the people of Victoria voted for Kennett believing that they were going to get the industrial relations legislation he put in place is a nonsense. They know it and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) knows it. He was embarrassed by it the week after Kennett introduced the legislation and it is about time he stopped having a memory lapse or a bit of time warp activity and realised that we will not let him forget it. The people of Victoria certainly will not forget it. The other thing that has come out very clearly in the last month or so is that people throughout the rest of Australia understand that pretty well too. Whether the honourable member for Bennelong likes it or not, he has the bell of Jeff Kennett around his neck and it is going to stay there right through until the election and after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of quick things about the Liberal Party's policy on freedoms. We have had an excellent contribution tonight by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) on these issues. The Opposition has made a big play about people's right to choose. The example of the bricklayer, referred to by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and expanded on by the honourable member for Fisher, quite clearly illustrates the point. This freedom of choice which the Liberal Party champions as the focus of its industrial relations policy is a freedom to reduce conditions of employment, to say to that bricklayer who works on a construction site, `You are being denied the freedom to cut your salary in half and we are going to give you that freedom'. That is the Liberal Party's promise to those building workers in Victoria. That is the example the honourable member for La Trobe gave when he and the honourable member for Fisher were pursuing that point. There is no doubt that the freedom that the Opposition talks about in industrial relations is a freedom to reduce conditions of employment, because all other freedoms exist now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition in industrial relations boils down to a couple of things. We support and enshrine a safety net for all Australians irrespective of where they work, irrespective of what State they may live in and irrespective of what industry they may work in. We also enshrine the right of every worker in this country to have access to an umpire to settle disputes. Those two fundamental rights we will continue to enshrine as a Labor Party in this place and as a labour movement. Neither of them are supported by the Opposition in its policies. Both of them are dear to the hearts of all Australians. They have been fundamental not just to industrial relations but to the way of life in this country since 1904, and the Opposition's efforts to remove them will rebound savagely upon it at the election in 1993. In view of the time, I will leave my comments at that. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate myself with this legislation before the House tonight because of its importance to the working men and women of Australia. It is a shame that this has had to happen but, when one looks at what is happening in Victoria, the Federal Government has taken a responsible action in pursuing this sort of legislation. It really concerns me that the Victorian Government's industrial relations legislation amounts to the greatest attack on basic trade union rights in Australia in over 100 years, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) reminded us earlier. There have been a number of Queenslanders speaking on this Bill this morning. We all lived through the Bjelke-Petersen era, and the thing that comes to my mind is the great SEQEB dispute in 1985; I see similarities between that situation and the Victorian one. The legislation that the Victorian Government is putting forward is the same sort of stuff that Bjelke-Petersen put forward all the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) can get up and talk about freedom. They told us that we are trying to take people's rights away. But this is all about choice. It is all about people being guaranteed minimum standards, minimum wages and equal pay&mdash;for instance, we need to achieve equal pay for women, and there is a lot of work still to be done in that area, as well as with unfair dismissals and fair redundancy payments. They are basic standards that we, as a responsible member of the international community, have to uphold in this country. That is what it is all about. It is amazing that those opposite have the audacity to get up here and oppose this sort of legislation, when one thinks that they have obviously no commitment to the average worker in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked much more time to say a few more things about the legislation, but I just offer my full support for it and ask those opposite to have a really good think about what they are putting forward here. They are having a reshape of their Fightback package. We are guaranteed here, by the honourable member for Bennelong, that there will not be any changes to the industrial relations package. The Opposition's industrial relations package is modelled on the Kennett model. The honourable member for Bennelong has made that admission. He has tried to skirt around the issue tonight, but he still comes back to the fact that his industrial relations package is modelled on the Kennett model. It would be bad news for every Australian worker if those opposite were ever to have the opportunity to implement such policies. But Australians are smarter than that and they certainly will not let the Opposition do that. I am very pleased to rise here to support this legislation and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As with the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), I will have to be very brief. A few matters have to be very quickly dealt with. Firstly, there has been the usual rhetoric from those opposite about the question of States rights&mdash;that there is a great attack on the constitutional foundations of the country. On that point, it is worth reading page 6 of the Opposition's document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jobsback!</EMPHASIS>, where it clearly makes this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A future Coalition government will seek complementary legislative action from state and territory governments to achieve the objectives of this policy. It will, if necessary, use whatever constitutional power is available to it, excluding the external affairs power&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Excluding that power alone. The document continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to ensure that the benefits of this policy are as widely available as possible to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>When we dismiss all this rhetoric here tonight about it being so dreadful that we are interfering with Victorians' rights, the reality is that the Opposition's industrial relations policy clearly articulates the intention to go down that same road. The other point that is well worth making is that this is not a departure from the Constitution's current practice. The Federal Industrial Relations Commission clearly already has this power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the Federal Government has chosen to restrict that power. It is simply implementing that power now because a clear intention of the legislation is that people should have the right to compulsory arbitration. That being departed from in Victoria, the Government is simply implementing the intentions of the Federal industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) coming forward with quotes from a rather self-interested source&mdash;I gather he is probably a member of the New Zealand round table&mdash;some businessman who said, `The Australian industrial relations system has not exploited its workers quickly enough'. I am not as interested in that remark as in some remarks made on the matter of common law. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) came in here again and said how dreadful it was that the Labor Government also utilised common law against the airline pilots strike. That might actually be correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite a few more worthwhile comments in regard to common law and its clear use against workers. William Holdsworth&mdash;people who were far more successful at law school than I might have heard of him&mdash;in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> History of English Law</EMPHASIS>, 1924 edition, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In truth until political economists of the earlier half of the nineteenth century converted the legislature to the belief that freedom of contract was the cure for all social ills, no one ever imagined that wages and prices could be settled merely at the will and pleasure of the parties to each particular bargain; or that the contract between employer and workman could be regarded as precisely similar to any other contract.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the political dominant group in the nineteenth century suddenly decided that there had been a glorious history of freedom of contract up until then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I quote another source on the question of the matter of this law. Sir Ian Gilmour, a Minister in the Thatcher Government, admittedly on the liberal wing of that Government, in a very interesting book I read this year titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Riots, Risings and Revolutions</EMPHASIS>, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greater unity of the ruling elite after mid-century and the new ideas of laissez-faire led government and Parliament to abandon any semblance of neutrality between masters and men and to take an increasingly stern view of industrial unrest. Laissez-faire was becoming the dominant dogma, and the duty to protect the weak was neglected . . . Following Adam Smith when it suited and ignoring him when it did not, Parliament embraced the fiction that `free contract' existed between a powerful employer and a poverty-stricken workman, and nothing else was needed.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very interesting quote from a Minister of the Thatcher Government about the actual history of how this law developed. And that is the reality of what those opposite are trying to indulge in now&mdash;suppressing wages, suppressing conditions and diminishing people's working rights. As the honourable member for La Trobe said, this represents a tremendous opportunity to halve the wages of people in the building industry and no doubt to halve those on even worse conditions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly tonight. If I for one minute thought that this debate was really about the rights of workers or about the concern of the Labor Party for the wages and conditions of workers, I probably would not have stood up tonight. The simple fact is that this whole debate is about protecting the privileged position of a very few people. That is really what it is all about. It is quite obvious to me from what we have seen over the last 10 years in this country that the trade union leadership could not give a tinker's curse about what happens to the workers on the factory floor. They have absolutely no interest in and no concern about what happens to them; they are about protecting privilege, about protecting their own position. If they were really serious about the men and women of this country who simply want to get a job, who simply want to be in a position where they can properly provide for their families, where they can give their children a better standard of education than they had and they can put a roof over their heads, if they were really serious about delivering those three basic things that every man and woman in this country is desirous of, no matter where they are from, what their background is or what their employment or potential employment is, they would start addressing the very issues that the Federal coalition is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal coalition recognises the relationship between employees and employers, and that is a very special relationship. It is not a relationship that in my view can be slammed here hour after hour, day after day, week after week by members of the Labor Party. I think it is absolutely deplorable that they can stand here and put this great division between two groups of people that have made this country work. Only under the Labor Party over the last 10 years has that system failed, and that system has failed because it does not recognise that special relationship. It has sought to drive a wedge into that special relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If certain members of the Labor Party bothered to go out to factories and bothered to speak to employers and employees and bothered to have a look at what has happened historically before they started dividing this country, they would find that that very special relationship just happened to deliver a great number of things. It just happened to deliver productivity, it just happened to deliver good and real wages and it just happened to deliver proper workplace agreements and a relationship within the workplace. Most importantly, it happened to deliver jobs. That is what it delivered. That special relationship delivered jobs, and the simple fact is that what we have seen over the last 10 years is the destruction of that ability to create jobs through that special relationship. </PARA>

Perhaps in the back of their mind honourable members opposite think there may be some advantage in having a million people out of work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made several comments tonight. He said that his policy had been misrepresented and that he wanted a genuine debate. I am quite happy for the honourable member for Bennelong to have a genuine debate. The reality is that the more people who understand what this policy is about, the better it is going to be, because we know how similar that policy is to the policy of the Kennett Government. The honourable member has said tonight that it is slightly different from the policy of the Kennett Government, but he is also on record as saying that it is about 80 to 90 per cent similar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No sensible worker in this country is going to support the policy that the honourable member for Bennelong has put forward. We only have a sketchy outline of it. The honourable member promised to deliver a draft Bill of this policy to the Parliament. We have not seen that draft Bill. There is a very important reason why we have not seen that draft Bill. We have had a contribution from three honourable members opposite on the very simple question of whether what is involved here involves a massive reduction in wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) affirmed that. That is right. That is what it is going to be. There will be big cuts in wages. The construction industry was given as an example. Then the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said that there are not going to be any cuts in  wages and that, in fact, there are going to be improvements in wages. What nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong was trying to have five bob each way. He said that if a worker negotiated a reduction in his wages, or a reduction in his holiday leave, so be it. How is a working man going to negotiate with a big employer, especially in the current economic context, anything but a reduction in his wages and conditions? The honourable member's policy only allows a working man freedom to go into a reduced situation. This has been proven by the actions of the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude with this example. One of the first acts of the Kennett Government was to sack 4,000 school cleaners. After it sacked those school cleaners that were earning roughly $400 a week&mdash;not exactly a huge pay&mdash;it told them they could all be re-employed on an individual contract for $250 a week. Two hundred and fifty dollars a week! That is the sort of industrial relations thuggery we are getting out of Mr Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that we have had 4,000 to 7,000 other people sacked by Mr Kennett. This is his idea of helping to resolve Victoria's problems. Of course, Victoria had problems, but what Mr Kennett has been doing in industrial relations and in every other area is making those problems much worse. The reality is that honourable members opposite have identified the Liberal Party and the Opposition parties here with that policy, and we are going to go to the election with that identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite might try to run away from it by saying there are small differences, but the people of Australia will be offered a very clear choice in industrial relations. They will be asking themselves whether they want to go begging to their employer, who will be in a position to tell them that they can have half the salary that they had before as well as a whole lot of condition changes. We know that there are cases of this kind already, so nobody is going to be better off with the proposals put forward by the Opposition. The workers of this country&mdash;including those middle-class workers who previously thought about voting for the Liberal Party&mdash;are going to say that they do not want a bar of this system. That is why they are deserting the Opposition in droves. So this next election is going to be fought very much on this industrial relations policy. I can assure everyone, as several members have said earlier, it is going to be another loss led by John Howard. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The length of my speech will acknowledge the lateness of the hour and will be in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject. The subject is the Government's response to the first report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia as an information society: grasping new paradigms</EMPHASIS>. The report was tabled in June 1991 and the response has been a very long time coming&mdash;probably a record. Nevertheless, the wait has proved to be worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite an occasional timidity and over anxiety in parts of the report, the Government has adopted the main thrust, the seven main conclusions set out on page xiii. In referring the 21 specific recommendations to individual Ministers for action, the Government accepts the broad validity of the thrust of the Committee's argument and the need to come to grips with redefining `information', while recognising that adoption of the terms set out in the report will obviously be a matter of evolving community usage rather than government decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is recognition that we are passing through an information revolution with a new social and economic paradigm&mdash;the information society. The report recommended the adoption of a national information policy, a set of broad principles governing access to information and recognising that the right to know is central to a democratic community, the divisions between the information rich and information poor can be socially and cultural divisive, and that Australia should maximise the return from its heavy investment in information&mdash;research, teaching, communications, banking, insurance and related activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government response acknowledges that no broad operating principles in information appear to have been committed to paper. The response concedes that there is value in redefining such a policy as a broad set of operating principles&mdash;the rules of the road&mdash;indicating objectives, using agreed definitions and using it as an instrument for encouraging debate, while noting that rigidity could be counterproductive in an area marked by constant change. The response suggests that information policy, however defined, should be referred to an interdepartmental committee or to the science and engineering council of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for further work and advice. I hope the Government will press on with this, and take it seriously and urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that Australia was already an information society in which 42 per cent of the Australian labour force was employed in the collecting, processing and dissemination of information, broadly defined, including not only all the people who work in this building but also lawyers, teachers, public servants, journalists, bankers, scientists, librarians, communication workers, accountants, and the like. We also concluded that Australia was an information society of the passive variety. We had ignored the policy implication and overlooked the economic implications for using information more effectively. Indeed, we often confused information&mdash;that is, the content&mdash;with information technology, or IT, the medium. The report is a short one but of major importance about a vital, but inadequately discussed, issue. What we have in Australia at the moment is not so much an industrial society in decay, relying on traditional interventionist measures to restore it, but an information society which is under-performing, and with a largely unrecognised potential. This report can help us grasp the essential reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We conclude that the failure to develop a coherent response on information policy was due to the extraordinary degree of fragmentation within government in this area and that all the relevant departments, about a dozen of them, tended to define information in different ways. The Government response cautiously concedes the validity of this assertion and the 18-month delay confirms our point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, elsewhere the importance of information policy issues is increasingly apparent. Vice-President elect Gore raised it in the US election. The OECD is working on it and economic theoreticians, looking for a new theoretical model to explain what happened in the global economy in the 1980s, are increasingly emphasising the critical factor of information and are now defining it with capital and labour as a factor of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts to put information on the political and economic agenda were defeated in 1986, but the Government now accepts that, for a clever country to succeed in a context of global competition, far more emphasis will have to be put on our use of information. We must now accept that information policy and industry policy are inextricably linked. This is an area where the Australian Government has lagged behind the States. Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland have all set up important committees on information policy, and Victoria made a major submission to the parliamentary inquiry. The Commonwealth must now take the lead. I am happy with the response. I regret the time lost since 1986, but it is not too late because Australia, with its strong research base, information infrastructure and use of the English language, is well positioned to take advantage of the information revolution. I thank the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) for his support and feel confident that he will push to ensure that the policy recommendations are followed up speedily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this hour of the morning, it probably would be far more sensible to do that, but I will speak, nevertheless. I will speak on the Imported Food Control Bill 1992, because it is very significant legislation for the food industry of Australia. Its purpose, as I am sure the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) would have said in his second reading speech&mdash;if he had delivered it&mdash;is to ensure that the same standards apply for imported food as for domestic food. I question whether the initial implementation strategy will completely meet that aim of having exactly the same standards. Even when that standard is achieved, the standards we will be requiring of food imported into this country will be less than many countries require of food that we export to those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Minister for his achievement, because this legislation has been a long time coming in this country. The reason for that delay has been that the food standards power is a State power or responsibility, and while we have had separate standards for each of the States, it has been impossible to have a uniform standard which we could apply against imports. I have been in this place for about 20 years, and in that time we have been debating, on and off, this particular requirement. I believe that one can go back many, many years before that, as I was told that the first attempt to bring uniform standards for food to Australia was a national standard in 1939. So it has been a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in the late 1970s, when the Federal coalition was in power, that the essential and necessary Federal legislation was passed. It took the States a number of years after that to pass the necessary State legislation. When that occurred by the mid-1980s, the Government established the National Food Authority. It then became necessary, if any progress was to be made, for a majority decision to be required rather than a complete consensus of the States. In the second reading speech that the Minister tabled, he indicated that the inspection of imported food began only in July 1990 at the national level, so that is a very recent situation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that I should give the honourable member the benefit of that, since he is the cause for our being here at this hour. As far as I am concerned, we will be proceeding with this legislation and this debate. When this inspection commenced in July 1990, it was on the very narrow basis of the powers in the Quarantine Act where, for example, inspection could take place for listeria in soft cheese, a bacteria which each year kills many people around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with a substance such as ascorbic acid&mdash;a preservative which cheese producers in a number of other countries are able to use, but which Australian cheese producers are not&mdash;this legislation could not be used. There is also the question of lead in soldered cans and the problems that that creates for food standards, particularly when food canned in Australia is required to be in welded cans. A recent study in Victoria showed that up to 60 per cent of imported food failed our packaging, labelling or health standard requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the legislation will allow the negotiation of certification arrangements with other countries to sensibly reduce the inspection costs and compliance requirements or costs. Other countries require far more significant procedures to apply to many of our products than we require for theirs. I am particularly thinking of the absurd requirements of the European Community with regard to the abattoir standards in this country. The European Community is basically using this as a means to force Australia completely out of a very restricted access for meat to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States also has very tough requirements. It sends its USDA people to Australia to check abattoir standards here. In my area of northern Victoria, fruit growers who want to export fresh fruit to the United States are required to pay for a USDA&mdash;United States Department of Agriculture&mdash;exporter to be resident in the Goulburn Valley for a time each year, so that access can be gained to that market. The point I am making is that the requirement costs for our exporters to many other countries are still far tougher than what will be required here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some very important related issues with this legislation, and this new procedure. The first of these is the cost of inspection. It is a user pays system, as it should be. We will still be using AQIS inspectors to inspect our export products. There have already been complaints from food importers&mdash;there are continual complaints from our exporters&mdash;that the cost of that inspection is too high. I agree, it is too high. The AQIS has a top-heavy administration and that is loaded into the total cost. Take the case of meat inspectors: they earn $30,000 to $35,000, but they are charged out at a rate of over $75,000 to cover that top-heavy situation . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the point of my Leader that this presents a very heavy and unfair burden on our exporters. There are already complaints from importers and we will be addressing that, when we are in government, to bring those costs down. There is also a problem with the gap in the labelling of bulk meat into this country. I think it was an oversight when meat was not included in the provisions that were established for the labelling of fish, fruit, vegetables, juice and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pig industry and the chicken meat industry are now very concerned with this gap as it provides an unfair advantage for imported pig meat and chicken meat. Those products can come in until such time as that labelling requirement is changed and, as I understand it, that procedure is under way. There is also a threat there for consumers in Australia because they will not be given the safeguard or the information as to whether that meat is a product of Australia or whether it comes from some other country. The Minister, if he is replying at the end of this debate, might like to make some comment about the state of that particular situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read his speech and, unfortunately, it is not in it. We still have the problem of incorrect and inadequate labelling. In order for the Australian consumer to know whether a product is Australian, the product must be adequately and accurately labelled. Another issue relates to standards of packaging and imported food. Cans, particularly the older style and lower grade ones which some countries sell to this country, can cause lead poisoning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister is replying, I would like him to comment on New Zealand compliance. I understand that discussions and debates on that issue are taking place at present. I strongly support the requirement for New Zealand to meet the same standards as Australia. I have been told by people in the dairy industry of the advantage that New Zealand has in being able to use ascorbic acid, which is banned in Australia because of its potential cancer forming properties, as a preservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the general issue of imported food versus exported food, particularly processed food. Last year the total amount of our imported food and beverages was about $2.3 billion. About half of that amount was spent on beverages and types of foods that are not available in this country; therefore, they are imported and always will be. In respect of the other half of that amount, the figure is increasing. According to a recent release by the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd, imported food and beverages increased dramatically by 21 per cent in the September quarter. That is the most significant increase that we have had in many years, which indicates the growing import bill for things such as dairy products, confectionery, apple juice and a range of other products. It means that Australia is in a very delicate position at present as to whether or not the export of processed food will increase at a faster rate than the imports. It is quite certain that imports will increase, particularly from New Zealand, due to the GST reforms and labour market reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is no laughing matter, particularly in my area, which happens to have more food processing factories than any other place in Australia. New Zealand now has a 30 per cent cost advantage in putting products through its factories and canneries. That is a tremendous advantage. In relation to abattoirs, New Zealand can now slaughter an animal&mdash;a steer or a sheep&mdash;for 50 per cent of the cost of slaughtering a similar animal in Australia because of its reforms. That country has a tremendous competitive advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our exports should be growing at a significantly faster rate than our imports. But we have the problem of other countries not being able to access processed Australian foods. At last, a number of Asian countries are, to a greater degree, starting to open up their markets for these types of products. I acknowledge that there are problems with some commodities at the farm level. I think of the progress that has been made in relation to processing tomatoes, particularly in my area. We are able to produce that product at the same price as California or New Zealand can. We still have some distance to go before our potato industry is as efficient as that of the Canadians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the farm gate, there are great problems. We lose competitiveness once a product moves into the transport system, the processing chain, the cannery or whatever it may be and then on to the wharf. There is plenty of documentation to prove this. The first Boston report was released about 12 months ago. Far more recently, the Meat Research Corporation released data which showed that it is now three times as expensive to slaughter a steer in Australia as it is in the United States and that it is twice as expensive to slaughter a steer in Australia as it is in New Zealand or Argentina. How can we compete when our beef producers receive considerably less than their counterparts for the same animal because of the loss and inefficiency once that animal leaves the farm?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point, and this is one that the food industries are very much aware of in Australia, is the hidden advantage for countries which have a goods and services tax or a value added tax system, because that removes the hidden export tax which all of our exporters pay at the present time. Treasury has indicated that that is equivalent to about a 5 per cent tax on all of our production costs, and it is removed under a GST system because exports are zero rated. New Zealanders in particular now have a considerable advantage in selling to Australia, and it is one of the reasons why New Zealand will be such a formidable competitor in the Australian market, as well as in third markets, against Australian product in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to embark upon a similar reform process through a GST system and through labour market reforms, transport reforms, waterfront reforms, et cetera, so that our food producers and processors can compete equally, competitively and profitably with New Zealand and other countries to gain more exports for our products and compete more adequately in the Australian market. The coalition parties support the legislation as it is very timely and important for this country, even if the hour at which it is being debated is not at all timely. </PARA>

I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing the Imported Food Control Bill 1992 into the House. It is overdue in the sense that consumers in this country have for quite a long time been asking for security on the quality and safety of food produce being imported into the country. AQIS has done an excellent job in vetting produce to date, but this will be now a much more uniform approach to the inspection of food products coming into Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the hour is approaching 4 a.m. I will not delay the House unduly, but there are some matters which I would like to speak about on the Imported Food Control Bill 1992. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has said, the coalition supports this Bill, but there are just a couple of matters that I want to bring to the attention of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main provisions of this Bill says that the applicable standard is defined by clause 3(1) to mean the national standard applying to particular food or a particular matter affecting food. I think it is a pity that this legislation has been rushed before the House because the standards that are going to apply to this Bill have not yet been determined. In fact, the National Food Authority has only just recently produced its draft report, a 360-page document. It is calling for submissions to be made, and people will have until 29 January next year to make comment on this report. In other words, we are actually being asked to vote on legislation in this place based on standards which have yet to be decided. I think that that is wrong and I think it is a terrible pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know whether we are talking about a mandatory standard, a voluntary standard or a combination of both. We do not even know what sort of code we are talking about in relation to this standard. Under this legislation, will labelling provisions be adequate? Will they include ingredient labelling, additive labelling, country of origin labelling, the labelling of unpackaged foods, date marking, nutrition labelling, health claims, food production and processes? What sorts of potentially misleading terms will be addressed in these standards? I do not want to miss the opportunity of mentioning in the House that this legislation is based on standards that have yet to be determined. As I said, I think that is a pity and I think it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention to another area of concern, to which the honourable member for Murray has already alluded: the cost of inspection by AQIS. It is all very well to talk about the efficiency and the increased role, but the cost of the charges is excessive. That cost can be borne by only one group of people: the Australian consumers. There is no getting away from that, and this legislation does not deal with that adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third concern that I want to raise this morning relates to whether a statutory marketing board will be formed as a result of this. Page 75 of the National Food Authority draft report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some food industry sectors have statutory marketing boards established which regulate the bulk sale of the commodity. Such laws do not impact on food standards provided they only seek to regulate such bulk sale. Statutory marketing boards may also play a role in relation to quality by requiring that commodities be of a certain grade or be classified into a variety of grades prior to sale.</PARA>
<PARA>I place firmly on the record that I am totally opposed to the introduction of a statutory marketing board. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for building yet another level of bureaucracy. It is another effort at empire building. While this legislation does address very real concerns in this area&mdash;as I have said, the coalition is certainly supporting this legislation&mdash;there are aspects raised by this National Food Authority draft report which should have been addressed prior to this legislation ever reaching this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to welcome the arrival of this legislation into the Parliament,  even though it is at this hour. There certainly has been a great deal of public agitation due to the belief that we should have had appropriate inspection mechanisms for imported food a long time ago. Whilst this legislation has its defects and inadequacies, at least it is a welcome step in that direction. In my maiden speech in this Parliament, I called for action in this particular area. Whilst I am not taking the credit single-handedly for the arrival of this legislation, I say that, as the Parliament draws to an end, I am pleased that at least one of the things that I felt needed to happen when I first came into this House is finally coming to fruition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that for a long time Australian food producers have been disadvantaged because their products have had to meet standards and health requirements that imported food products have not. That is a competitive disadvantage and it is also clearly unfair. It is bad enough that Australian food producers have to compete with imported products that are subsidised and dumped, but when we also have different standards our industry is put at a significant disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of food imports into Australia has increased dramatically under this Government. Last year $2.36 billion worth of food was imported. This once wonderfully productive country that could grow everything Australians needed has been so destroyed, its infrastructure so damaged, its confidence so shot that we are now finding it necessary to import the basic things that we eat from day to day. I think that is very much to the Government's shame. Some of this food coming into Australia is of poor standard, perhaps with chemical contamination that is not acceptable in this country, produced by food processing standards that are not acceptable in this country, coming in, for instance, in lead-soldered cans which are banned for Australian food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that these sorts of substandard practices occur is also a consumer issue. Australian consumers have a right to expect that the food they buy in the supermarkets meets reasonable standards, and they particularly have that right to that kind of expectation when they know that high standards are expected in Australian factories, on Australian farms and in the Australian production system. So it is important for Australian consumers that they have some confidence that what they are buying is of good quality. There is the classic story that is repeated often of the dried apricots that were imported into this country but then could not be re-exported because, although they met our import standards, they did not meet our export standards. That is the kind of double-talk nonsense that has made this whole matter one of public concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was raised by previous speakers about the cost of the inspection system, and clearly there will be costs, particularly when AQIS is involved. Its record of charging is infamous. I suppose again there is some element of justice here in that at least the imported food will now have to wear the same unjust penalties, the same unjust AQIS charges, that domestic food producers have had to meet. But that is not really satisfactory. It is high time that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) came to grips with the outrageous costs of AQIS. I raised some of these issues in this House a few weeks ago and my comments were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times.</EMPHASIS> The Minister, being an avid reader of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS>, rushed off a letter to the editor complaining about what I said. In it he basically defended the charges of AQIS and said that the cost is expected to fall by one per cent in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious question we ask is: if the costs are falling, why do the charges keep going up, in fact going up by several hundred per cent? There has been outrage throughout the Australian exporting community at the appalling cost increases&mdash;costs of thousands of dollars a day, even tens of thousands of dollars a day, for AQIS inspection charges, which clearly cannot be justified. So it is not good enough for the Minister to just say, `Well, we are getting better' or, `We have reached satisfactory standards'. AQIS is still charging rates which are clearly unacceptable. AQIS must come to grips with the kinds of costs that it is imposing on Australian exporters. This Bill provides inspection charges now for imports. It evens the equation, but that is hardly a fair mathematical result. The Bill is certainly a move in the right direction. It is great to see that Australian consumers will have the protection of some kind of inspection standards not only on domestically produced food but now also on imported products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this late hour, I will not take very long. I have a couple of important things to add to the debate on the Imported Food Control Bill and, despite being drowsy, honourable members opposite might listen and learn something. I congratulate the Government on bringing in a Bill on food standards. The $2.36m billion worth of food that comes into this country will be subject to the national food standard, which is a welcome move, though long overdue. We might at last start to get&mdash;dreadful term&mdash;a level playing field in the way that we test food. It has been an outrageous situation that until now imported food has not been required to meet anything like the standards we apply to Australian food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that needs to be looked at&mdash;it is an extension of this&mdash;is what to do with our own manufacturers when it comes to testing food standards. We not only test the food, but we put rigorous standards on how factories should be built, how much stainless steel ought to go into them and so on. We totally bureaucratise private enterprise in the production of food. This is an outrageous situation that adds imposts to our manufacturers without creating one productivity gain. The only test that we should have for our local producers is the standard by which food is produced. If the end product meets the standard, it should not be of any interest to government how it got there. It seems quite a nonsense that we allow State government bureaucrats to go around and do nothing but interfere with the efficiency of production. That is a matter that ought to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also quite concerned about how our food reaches the supermarket shelves. The purchasing very much favours imports against local production, especially small local producers. I think honourable members in this place ought to be aware of the system of purchasing by supermarkets. Supermarkets charge for shelf space. The net effect is that small local producers do not get the opportunity of putting their produce onto their local supermarket shelves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my manufacturers was charged up to $4,000 to put one line on a supermarket shelf, and every line after that was going to cost him another $4,000. Over and above that, there was some 17 1/2 per cent in other charges&mdash;a 5 per cent case allowance, a 5 per cent warehouse allowance, a 2 per cent ranging allowance and a 5 per cent cooperative allowance. These were all charges that were built into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because essentially of laziness and the monopoly situation that our major supermarkets find themselves in, Australian small manufacturers are not getting their produce onto the supermarket shelves. This is an outrageous situation. I call on the supermarkets to have a look at this situation. It falls into one of two areas. It is either a restrictive trade practice, in which case it ought to be outlawed&mdash;the Minister responsible, who is not in the House at the moment, ought to have a look to see whether this is restrictive trade practices at their worst&mdash;or it is just straight lazy purchasing habits by the supermarket chains.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the National Rail Corporation (NR), to trade as National Rail, will involve a fundamental change in the role of the Australian National Railways Commission (AN). Since the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the former South Australian Railways in 1978, AN has been responsible for a major transformation of rail services. It has changed from an organisation operating a variety of freight and passenger services throughout rural South Australia, much of which was unsuited to rail, to one with a strong focus on long distance, high volume interstate freight and bulk traffics where rail's strength in the marketplace lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, a limit to how far AN could go to solve the problems of the rail industry in Australia today. Our legacy from the past has resulted in a disjointed approach to interstate rail freight which has meant that in the interstate market, where rail should be doing well, it is losing ground. What is required is a single organisation which would enable shippers to have their goods transported between Australia's major cities efficiently and reliably. This has been emphasised time and time again by the transport users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet this need, the heads of government of the Commonwealth and mainland States agreed in July 1991 to establish NR, to take responsibility for interstate rail freight from the existing systems over the next few years. The National Rail Corporation Agreement Act 1992 approves this agreement, called the Shareholders' Agreement. As over 60 per cent of AN's current activities are related to interstate freight operations, in time, AN will become responsible for a much more limited range of operations, focussing on interstate passengers, intrastate freight in South Australia and Tasmania and workshops. The protections under the South Australian Railway Transfer Agreement will be observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Shareholders' Agreement provides for the transfer over time of certain functions and assets from AN and the State rail authorities to NR once NR has been established. However, the obligation to ensure that the transfers occur lies with governments, which are required to `cause' them to take place; the Agreement places no obligations directly on the rail authorities in this matter. This amendment to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 will put beyond doubt the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations under the Shareholders' Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of NR will require AN's full cooperation and is likely to require of AN actions which it considers are not in its own commercial interests and therefore contrary to its obligations under section 18 of the ANRC Act.

Broadcasters have accepted the need for programs displaying the stronger forms of violence, sex and crude language to be shown after 9 p.m. and the codes they are currently developing will so provide. In fact, their main worry was that they should retain the right to modify those programs to ensure that they meet the stricter ideas of what should be shown on television. So the amendments propose that the codes of practice should allow for modification of films to ensure that they at least meet the OFLC classifications for the time slot shown, knowing that, in many cases, the versions of films shown as M or MA on television will have been modified to remove scenes which would be acceptable to the Censor under that classification for cinema display. </PARA>

Firstly, the present standard for the discharge in near-coastal zones and special areas of oily wastes and residues from machinery spaces is to apply to all sea areas.

Secondly, the amendments will improve the standard for the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil or oily mixtures from cargo tanks of oil tankers outside special areas by reducing the permitted rate of discharge from 60 to 30 litres per nautical mile.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of matters I want to raise quickly. One relates to the impact of the legislation on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to allow the ABC to carry corporate sponsorship and promotional material on the new international satellite service. Previously the coalition has indicated its support for the development of that service and most certainly its support for the sponsorship of that service. I note in recent remarks by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he indicated there would be an opportunity for Australian business to participate in this facility. I hope that will be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also visited Indonesia and talked with the relevant Indonesian Minister and people charged with providing a satellite service. I think it is a development of an ongoing constructive relationship with that country because we are going to be utilising a satellite on the Indonesian service operated by Palapa. One of the amendments that I proposed that was taken forward in the Senate was to ensure that the sponsorship guidelines that are attached to this proposed service by the Corporation provide that where Radio Australia provides an audio broadcast service the decisions about the prohibition or the acceptance of sponsorship on that service are not just a matter for the Corporation but a matter for others; that is, for this place. I obviously am signalling, as I did publicly some time ago, that I believe it is an inconsistency to have sponsorship on the television service and not to allow that to take place in a similar way on our other international service, our longstanding and successful international service, Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to make reference to is an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act. This Bill amends 11-odd Acts. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) will talk about rail, and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) will talk about ships and seafarers, the discharge of oil from ships, the MARPOL convention and so on. I will talk about amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. When the original legislation went through the Parliament there was a major debate relating to the rights or otherwise of journalists in what was construed to be an attempt to codify the common law in relation to journalists being able to protect their sources. There has been considerable debate about this issue for a long period of time. This Bill seeks to codify it in a more reasonable way, so that it is a reasonable excuse for a journalist to refuse to respond to an ABA request if he wishes to protect a source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mixed feelings about this, and the coalition certainly does, but we will not oppose the passage of this amendment. The objections relate to the fact that, at the moment, if you can prove to a judge that it would be detrimental to reveal that source, then the common law is at liberty to protect that source. But the case is judged on the circumstances at the time. We do not want to create a legislative arrangement vesting in journalists significant rights that are not enjoyed by other people. This is a matter that we will monitor over time to see how it develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments relating to the Radio Communications Act which I shall not refer to. There are significant amendments relating to the Telecommunications Act. The details have been talked about by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon). One establishes the position of Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. We support that, because that is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another relates to the situation in New South Wales. We moved an amendment in the Senate regarding this matter but it was lost. That amendment is among those that I have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The Government is trying to limit the capacity of the New South Wales Government to utilise its own line links between places. For example, it runs a line from Sydney to Parramatta on which it might carry Elcom telecommunications traffic. What it wants to do is to access the excess capacity on that line link to carry, for example, New South Wales police traffic. It is not intended that that excess capacity be offered to commercial buyers in such a way as to fulfil the fear that the Government has&mdash;and indeed the other operators have&mdash;of duopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not support the duopoly and we do not believe the intention of the New South Wales Government goes to the extent of the fears that have been expressed by the Government and, therefore, we do not believe the amendment that the Government is proposing is necessary. Our amendment seeks to allow the New South Wales Government to use those line links to the best capacity available to carry the communications traffic of its public entities. I think that the bona fides of the New South Wales Government in what it intends to do can be seen in the recent appointment of a facilities manager of its communications needs, similar to what has taken place in Queensland. That is an office that is going to try to broker the best rates for the carriage of State government communications. I signal that the development of State government facilities advisers and carriers is an issue that is going to continue, and we will certainly be monitoring it very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention another matter of contention throughout the telecommunications and broadcasting area: the determination of content. We are quickly coming to the position where the issue of carriage is not so much a matter of concern. There are multiple ways to carry a signal that ought to be allowed and pursued. But the matter of content has developed into some significant arguments which are the contentious issues that have been dealt with in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary, in the second reading speech, related the decisions on violence on television which all of us in this place have now seen, and the passage of the Bill tonight is something that all of us would welcome. There has been some negotiation. We started with a 9.30 p.m. start time. That has gone to 9 o'clock in view of the impact on the industry. We have also now seen the development of a new classification system, which was endorsed by all the Premiers at the recent conference, and that system will be reflected in the State legislation in time. I have had talks with many of my colleagues, the film literature and industry people and so on, and I think we have come to a position which meets most people's concerns. I have talked with the Children's Television Foundation, for example. I think the churches are certainly much happier with the outcome that is in this piece of legislation. I certainly believe that these are issues, however, that are going to continue to be contentious. If the recent arguments in this place are any indication, that will certainly be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make mention of some matters that I raised today in another forum relating to the privatisation of AOTC. We clearly indicated that we are pulling forward and we believe that the privatisation process should commence as soon as possible. I also signalled that there would be some inquiry into the national transmission arrangements as they impact on the ABC and the SBS. That is something that I have raised several times previously, and that work is yet to be completed. But there may well be some savings in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some contention about the capacity of the stock market to meet the challenges of early privatisation of AOTC. The Chief Economist of the Australian Stock Exchange, Michael Heffernan, said that he thought it could be absorbed without a great deal of difficulty. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are looking for good viable opportunities to put their funds and they must just switch it from somewhere else into these good viable enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the prospect of Australians investing in this telecommunications carrier. It will be a very exciting time when AOTC commences the privatisation process. I do not believe it is, as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) said, an horrific prospect. As I said today, it is something that the Government will have to face. It is a reality that has emerged in many countries, regardless of their political complexion, as the trend with which we need to proceed. That is something I will welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also moved to bring the ABC and SBS formally under the Act that applied to commercial television. We felt that the public broadcasters should be treated in the same way as the private broadcasters. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated. I have had a look at the ABC's code. It was quick off the mark and was the first one to put that code to the ABA. I hope it will have a speedy passage. On Saturday, SBS is going to deal with the codes issue as well. Violence in content is a problem which deeply concerns many honourable members on this side. We have often commented on it. The issue of X-rated videos is still a problem. These issues are going to continue to be of great moment and concern to parents in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I signal that, whilst the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made a concession and had it reflected in legislation&mdash;and that certainly is progress&mdash;it is reflective of broad community concerns about this issue. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) expressed this concern at a family conference some time ago. The community should understand that the coalition will continue in this place to monitor progress carefully and diligently to ensure that the material that is reaching our children is not deleterious to their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training for allowing me to incorporate those amendments so that those who take the time to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will understand what it was that we were talking about and attempting to do, given that it is after 4.30 a.m. </PARA>

The Government sprung this on the Senate at very short notice. It is a pity that this amendment was needed, even though we will not oppose it, basically because it shows that the Government has not developed the trust with the National Rail Corporation and Australian National to allow it to facilitate the movements towards the National Rail Corporation which it should have been able to do under existing legislation without the need which it apparently now feels for this additional amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude the Opposition comments on the legislation that my colleagues the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) have already spoken on. The coalition happily supports the amendments to the legislation which reflect my portfolio area, that is the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, as we have made similar changes to the Act over the last couple of years. We do it for the simple reason that this is an issue which is of great concern to people who are interested in the protection of our environment, particularly the marine environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something that I think all honourable members on this side of the House are willing to participate in because we can see that, whilst there may be from time to time additional costs borne by industry in order to fulfil these ambitions, it is a cost worth bearing because of the need to protect our environment. The Opposition has ensured that, when every reasonable amendment to the Act is put forward by the Government, it will support it. In this particular instance, it is an amendment to the Act that has been brought on as a result of a movement by the international maritime community to reduce the amount of oily substances and residues that are put into the sea by ships in our waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this, as it does all other reasonable measures in relation to the environment or the safety of ships at sea, as we heard earlier today in the House when the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and other members debated the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> that was tabled in the House today. It is a Bill that we support and I make the point that we are, from time to time, quite wrongly accused by honourable members of the Government of not being interested in this area. Our track record over the last 2 1/2 years on this stands up to any test and we have a very sincere interest in these sorts of amendments to ensure that we protect our environment from any further pollution that we all know has occurred in the past and that we hope will not occur in the future. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The inquiry was referred to the Committee by the Senate in December 1990 following a number of attempts by Senate Estimates Committee A to examine the circumstances surrounding the failure of a major Crimes Act prosecutions of a well-known importer and manufacturer of shirts. Because of the extremely delicate nature of the wide range of issues considered in this inquiry, it is necessary to speak to this report in the House tonight. I point out that I will not be commenting further on it outside the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received almost 2,200 pages of transcript resulting from 14 public hearings, 11,600 pages of submissions, some 8,000 pages of exhibits and about 3,000 pages of confidential material. By any measure, this is an enormous task that has been undertaken with a multiplicity of complex issues to be addressed, and which are addressed in this 610-page report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has brought down a large number of recommendations concerning, as the subtitle of the report suggests, the paramount case of a failure of Customs. The Committee is well aware that its examination of the ACS was confined to a review of part of only one of several subprograms within Customs. Furthermore, that examination was confined primarily to the actions of Customs officers in New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, the ACS Central Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, and to enable a wider independent perspective on the operation of the investigation subprogram to be obtained, the Committee has recommended that consideration be given by the National Audit Office to conducting an Australia-wide efficiency and skills audit of the investigation subprogram of Customs. Overall, the evidence before the Committee indicated that the Australian Customs Service was at best incompetent, or at worst conspiratorial and deceitful in this matter. In this regard, should further evidence emerge demonstrating that the Committee has been deliberately misled, appropriate action will be taken under the full powers of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated earlier, one of the reasons why the inquiry took much longer than originally anticipated was that the Committee received an unprecedented quantity of evidence. It discovered an excessive number of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and contradictions in the evidence provided by key witnesses from government agencies. In addition, many of the answers to questions posed by the Committee appeared to be evasive. Although the Comptroller-General cannot be held personally responsible for all of the actions of his individual subordinate officers, he must accept responsibility for the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the Australian Customs Service, for the prevailing culture in that service, and for the changes that must be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To turn to the case itself: in June 1988, charges in relation to an alleged misuse of quotas involving fraud of $4.5m were laid against directors of Midford Paramount Pty Ltd and its tariff adviser. Committal proceedings commenced one year later, but were discontinued soon after when the Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew the charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February of the following year, the magistrate awarded costs against the Commonwealth of around $365,000. In so doing, he was highly critical of the manner in which the case had been prepared and presented, and severely castigated the two principal witnesses, one from the Australian Customs Service and the other from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Under cross-examination these two witnesses had departed significantly from their sworn statements which had been tendered to the committal proceedings. It was established that in a number of key areas the evidence contained in those statements was incorrect or insupportable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the withdrawal of the charges against Midford and its tariff adviser, and the award of costs by the magistrate, the Committee noted that the defendants had suffered enormous financial losses through unreimbursed legal fees and diminution in the values of their respective businesses. Specific actions by the Australian Customs Service, in particular, had resulted in the latter. In effect, the defendants had been severely punished, although they had not been convicted of any crime. As a consequence, the Committee has recommended that the defendants in the Midford case, and others, be compensated for their unrecovered material and legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examination of the quota matter and the reasons for the failure of the committal proceedings revealed to the Committee that this was only one of a series of prosecutions that the Australian Customs Service had sought to bring against Midford. For various reasons, none of these other matters proceeded to the stage where charges were actually laid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee discovered serious shortcomings in the investigatory work undertaken by the Customs Service in relation to these other matters and concluded that it, too, may have suffered the same fate as the quota matter, had it progressed to the courts. Inadequacies in the investigation conducted by Customs was also one of the primary causes for the failure of the prosecution of the quota matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constantly throughout this inquiry witnesses from the Australian Customs Service maintained that Midford had not been cleared of the charges, that it was guilty of crimes and that the magistrate presiding over the case had got it wrong. It appeared to the Committee that, in particular, Customs was displaying the attitude of Boston street cops&mdash;instant justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the inquiry progressed, the Committee discerned an emerging pattern about the investigatory methods and abilities of the New South Wales based Customs investigators. All too often they, along with some Central Office based Customs officers, misunderstood or misconstrued the evidence before them, jumped to insupportable conclusions and ignored or even deliberately suppressed evidence or explanations provided by those individuals subject to investigation. It was also evident that at times the ACS actively sought to prevent the provision of such explanations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was observed that not only did the Customs investigators lack understanding and expertise in the matters they were dealing with; more importantly, these officers failed to recognise their limitations and seek appropriate assistance where required. It was the Committee's view that adequate management systems should have been in place to detect these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the performance of other government agencies, the Committee found that witnesses from DITAC had an unclear understanding of policy requirements in respect of quotas and that they failed to detect or correct misunderstandings of those requirements by ACS officers responsible for the implementation of that policy. Deficiencies were also noted in the mechanisms used by DITAC to convey the intent of the quota policy to the ACS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was, in part, sympathetic to the DPP's position. As prosecutor of the case, the DPP had received sworn evidence from senior bureaucrats which purported to represent policy requirements, but which was later found to be unreliable. However, the Committee felt that the case could and should have been better prepared and managed. Evidence was dismissed as irrelevant at a relatively junior level within the offices of the DPP which, when tendered by the defence, discredited the prosecution's key witnesses and resulted in the complete withdrawal of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue emerged during the inquiry which is of great concern to the Committee. Evidence was received from Midford's former customs agent that he had been threatened that he would be made unemployable if he gave evidence to the Committee that was unfavourable to the Australian Customs Service. The Committee views this matter very seriously and continues to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total the Committee has made 134 recommendations in this report. Any cursory reading of those recommendations would indicate that many of the improvements suggested by the Committee are simple, straightforward matters which could be described as either commonsense or basic good management practice. That these motherhood statements had to be made in the report stands as a terrible indictment of the Australian Customs Service. It is a poor reflection on that organisation that many of the more fundamental matters raised in this report needed to be said at all. The Committee hopes that the Australian Customs Service will view positively the recommendations in this report and improve its operations so that it can regain the trust of those it protects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee, particularly the Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson, who is always a great Deputy Chairman, Senator Bishop, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) for spending many long hours examining what has been a most difficult and complex case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all the Committee, of our staff, including the inquiry secretary, John Carter, and our secondee from the Australian National Audit Office, David Spedding, who has had to live with this case, who has carried out a great deal of work on this inquiry and who has spent almost every waking hour on it. Our administrative officer, Lorraine Hendy, is also worthy of great praise. I commend the report to the House and I thank the House for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)&mdash;(6) The attached table lists research and development projects undertaken for the Department of Transport and Communications by private and public sector bodies. The list covers only those projects commissioned by the Department since it was created in 1987. Information is not readily available on projects which were commissioned by the separate departments of Transport, Aviation and Communications before that date. While a fairly broad interpretation has been given to the term "research and development" the table does not include all consultants engaged by the Department; that information is available in the Department's Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) It is not possible, at this stage, to provide a response in relation to this question. As far as is practicable the Department relies on its own officers to perform its functions. However, on occasions it is more cost effective to engage external consultants, from either the private or the public sector to perform specialist functions. In selecting consultants the Department attempts to promote open and effective competition wherever possible. When specialist skills are required, as is generally the case with research and development projects, tenders are called for where possible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government's long term objective is to upgrade the Hume Highway to a four-lane divided standard with bypasses of major towns and cities, where warranted. Over 77 per cent of the highway will be built to this standard by 1994 (100 per cent in Victoria and 65 per cent in New South Wales) when current high priority projects are completed. No decision has been made on when this upgrading will be completed as it will depend on future levels of funding and an assessment of its priority compared to works required elsewhere on the National Highway system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost of works required to complete the highway to four lane standard is some $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Proposed funding for maintenance on the Hume Highway during 1992/93 is $44.6 million. It is estimated that approximately half of these funds will be spent on parts of the Highway presently constructed to four lane standard. Maintenance of a bitumen surface is approximately $15,000 per lane kilometre per annum, and maintenance of a concrete surface is approximately $5,300 per lane kilometre per annum (both figures in $1990/91).</PARA>

A relative approach would involve measuring poverty relative to the general standard of living of the whole community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN APPLICATION</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. Professor Ronald F. Henderson pioneered poverty line research in Australia. As a measure of poverty, he nominated an amount equivalent to the basic wage plus child endowment in 1966 for a standard income unit comprising working husband, non working wife and two children. He adopted equivalence scales based on household expenditure data derived from a New York survey conducted in 1954. Finally he proposed that movements in before-tax AWE be used to index the resulting poverty lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">6. This work formed the basis of the poverty lines used in the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, the main report of which was published in 1975. These poverty lines have been regularly updated;  however, since 1981, the National Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has used quarterly national account figures of the movements in per capita household disposable income (HDI) instead of AWE to index the lines. The ostensible reason for the change was that HDI/head was considered more appropriate for reflecting changes in average income over time. However, it should be noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Henderson himself recommended that AWE should be used to adjust the poverty lines;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the original poverty line was based on a gross income measure&mdash;the minimum wage&mdash;and therefore a before tax income indicator such as AWE is a more appropriate inflator than an after tax indicator such as HDI;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">while the choice of HDI or AWE would have made little difference to the resulting poverty lines prior to the change, HDI has increased more rapidly than AWE since the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">7. Any measure of poverty involves subjective judgements; in Henderson's case, however, these are accompanied by significant methodological flaws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">8. The Henderson benchmark was the basic wage plus child endowment in 1966. Such a measure attempted to relate poverty to both community levels of disposable income (a relative approach) and, by use of equivalence scales derived from a budget survey, to a measure of subsistence (an absolute approach). It was thus, from the beginning, a hybrid poverty line. Moreover, the basic wage had by 1966 ceased to be a measure of the minimum income needed to support a family, and represented merely an "acceptable" level of income </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for an individual worker. It has been argued, and admitted by Professor Henderson himself, that this benchmark was almost entirely arbitrary although it was (and has continued to be) characterised as extremely austere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">9. The indexation of this benchmark was necessary to preserve its value. However, by using movements in AWE (and then household disposable income) for this purpose, the poverty line has increased in real terms corresponding with the general increase in standards of living across the community. With such indexation, the poverty line lost any remaining claim to represent an absolute or a subsistence income level (see Table 1 below comparing the poverty line updated by HDI as opposed to CPI). It has increased by about 19% in real terms between December 1973 and September 1987 using the CPI as the deflator&mdash;AWE has increased by 14% in real terms over the same period. (The higher growth in HDI relative to AWE is due to the dramatic growth in the labour force participation rate of married women, which has increased by over 20 percent since 1981.)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">10. The equivalence scales used by Professor Henderson were derived from household expenditure data compiled for New York in 1954. Such data is highly unlikely to be appropriate for setting Australian poverty lines in 1987 and beyond. For instance the expenditure patterns of Australian households in the 1980s could be expected to be very different from households in New York in 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">11. Various efforts to refine Henderson's work using Australian data have been generally unsuccessful. The variation between possible alternative equivalence scales has resulted in ongoing debate about which is the most appropriate. The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research is currently undertaking a major study into the costs of children, from which they hope to develop a current and relevant Australian equivalence scale. In the meantime, Henderson's line, being the only one regularly updated, has by default and ignorance achieved general community acceptance, notwithstanding its entirely flimsy intellectual underpinning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">12. In particular, two little understood implications of updating the Henderson poverty line by movements in HDI or AWE are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government's policy of indexing pensions by the CPI will in time lead to pensions falling below the poverty line, if, as expected, real incomes rise in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) except insofar as it affects the level of unemployment, economic growth cannot of itself achieve any reduction in the extent of poverty as measured;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">instead according to Henderson a reduction in poverty would require an explicit policy of redistribution through changed wage relativities or more probably higher taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of HDI exacerbates this problem since even a reduction in unemployment may not be reflected in the number of people in poverty, as the following simplified and purely illustrative analysis shows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assume that initially 20 per cent of the labour force are unemployed and below the poverty line and 10 per cent of those employed have incomes below the poverty line. The poverty rate would be 28 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the unemployment rate halves and the income distribution of those employed remains the same (ie AWE is unchanged) then using an AWE updated poverty line the poverty rate would drop by 9 percentage points to 19 percent (10 percent unemployed and 10 percent of the remaining 90 percent of the population in employment).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, an HDI updated poverty line is used, then a reduction in unemployment will result in an increase in the poverty line through the increased HDI and the number of employed people in poverty will increase as a consequence. It would be possible to have an income distribution for the employed population such that a reduction in the level of unemployment could result in an increase in the number of people measured as being in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">13. The updating method used therefore impacts not only on the poverty lines but also on the measurement of the number of people in poverty. An analysis of the income distribution data from the 1981/82 Income and Housing Survey by ABS suggests, for example, that use of a CPI updated line gives a figure of less than 2/3 of the estimate obtained using an HDI updated line. There are serious deficiencies in this data, particularly at lower income levels, and the absolute numbers obtained should not be considered reliable. The difference between the two results does, however, clearly indicate the sensitivity of the numbers to the poverty line used and the difficulties involved in objectively measuring poverty. The use of poverty lines should therefore be treated as indicative only&mdash;in relation to trends in the numbers of persons in poverty&mdash;rather than as a reliable indication of precise numbers of persons living in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING EQUIVALENCE SCALES</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">14. As with specifying a poverty line in terms of income alone and so ignoring other factors that are integral to the assessment of standards of living, equivalence scales provide a very narrow basis for determining the relative well being of diverse family groups. They make no allowance for the non-financial costs and benefits derived from raising children. In fact, the degree to which an equivalence scale accounts for the direct financial costs and benefits deriving from the composition of various families depends on the method used to estimate the scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">15. Two broad approaches are used to define equivalence scales&mdash;the "budgetary" approach and the "proportional" approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">16. The "budgetary" approach seeks to define a "basket of goods", or a budget, which would allow compositionally different families to achieve the same specified standard of living. The relative costs of these budgets for different family types provide the equivalence scales. The greatest weakness of this approach is that it assumes that a specific poverty line standard of living can be defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">17. Henderson used the 1954 "Family Budget Standard", prepared by the Budget Standard Service of the Community Council of Greater New York to adjust his poverty line for differing family structures. Since 1954 a number of subsequent New York budget studies have been undertaken. Two of these&mdash;in 1962 and 1969&mdash;have been major studies which have reflected changing values as to what constitutes a "modest but adequate" standard of living. These changes illustrate the extent to which the budget standard is basically an arbitrary one. For example, the cost of TVs and cars were included in the 1969 standard but not the 1954 one;  the 1954 standard allowed one suit a year but in 1969 one suit was expected to last 3 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">18. The inherent problem in the "budgetary" approach is that the scales are derived by a series of ad hoc judgements about an adequate standard of living at a particular point in time. They are not based on any explicit theory or measurement of family behaviour. The relevance to Australian families of overseas derived budgets must be considered dubious particularly as they do not reflect current Australian conditions or price relativities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">19. The "proportional" approach seeks to estimate equivalence scales by measuring the relative proportions of total family income expended by differing family types to achieve the same standard of living. There are a number of different methodological approaches to this analysis. The "Canadian" method (used by Statistics Canada) sets an arbitrary level for the proportion of income expended on "necessities" and determines the level of income at which families of differing composition expend proportionally less than this set level. The income relativities so derived provide the equivalence scales. The "Utility Theoretic" approach uses commodity demand functions as a measure of the standard of living and, by estimating the parameters of the function for differing family types, derives equivalence scales by determining the levels of income at which utility for different family types is equal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">20. The "proportional" approach has the apparent advantages of limiting the number of judgements involved in deriving equivalence scales and also of being based on the actual expenditure behaviour of households or families. However, what constitutes a standard of living is not defined and the approach is purely empirical. It is methodologically flawed in that to be reliable, studies undertaken to date have found it necessary to draw on sample data for the whole population, not just those near or at poverty level. In fact the utility demand functions used in the second approach assume the existence of discretionary expenditure on a range of commodities, a notion which may be considered inconsistent with the existence of poverty. As the analysis is based on averaging expenditure data it can make no allowance to any degree of substitution of consumption that occurs between families of similar income levels but different composition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the Family Court that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This information is not readily available and to collect it would require an unreasonable diversion of the Court's resources. However, a study was made in 1991 for the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act covering Registries which were on-line to the Blackstone computer system for the whole of that year. Those Registries had 39.5% of all files opened in that year. From the sample of those Registries an Australian wide estimate for the Family Court of Australia was extrapolated. On that estimate there were 322 warrants to take possession of a child issued. Of these, the applicant in 54% of the cases was the wife, in 44% of the cases the husband and 2% were other parties. These figures do not show whether the warrants were issued against the custodial parent or the one having access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) This information is not readily available but an estimate made on the same basis as in (1) for the year 1991 is that 206 applications for summary enforcement were made. Of these, 84% were filed by the husband, 14% by the wife and 2% by other parties. Of the 206 applications, 59% were dismissed, 29% withdrawn and the remaining 12% led to a recognisance, fine or other conviction. All applications that led to a conviction were filed by the husband.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Compensatory access orders were not available until section 112AJ of the Family Law Act 1975 came into force on 25 January 1990. The number of such orders is not available without a comprehensive file search. Although a number of Judges are understood to have made orders under section 112AJ, there are no reported cases in which such orders have been made. The Joint Select Committee in its report tabled on 24 November 1992 came to the conclusion that  "the Family Court has available to it a wide range of courses of action, which it does not appear to be using to their best, or even their intended, advantage. In particular, the Committee cites the introduction of new penalties for the enforcement of court orders, which the Court has not yet begun to use to their best effect."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The statistical records do not contain sufficient detail to determine which fines and orders were imposed on custodial parents in access matters. Community service orders were not available until section 112AG of the Family Law Act came into force on 25 January 1990 and by September 1991 all States except New South Wales were "participating" in terms of the section. There is provision in the agreements for the States to bill the Commonwealth for the services provided on a quarterly basis. I am informed that again there have been no reported cases in which such orders have been made nor have any bills been submitted for payment, indicating an apparent reluctance on the part of the Courts to make use of the new provision in the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The graduate of ITPS did not take 18 months to achieve the same standard as pilots who completed military Test Pilot (TP) courses. However, it is fair to say that, due to the syllabus content at that time and lack of military aircraft types at the civilian school, the graduate of ITPS was not the equal of the military course graduates for about 12 months after graduation. While the civilian school trains pilots to an acceptable standard they cannot train a military test pilot to the same standard, for military test flying, as a military school. Nevertheless, no generalisation should be drawn from this one instance because differences can be attributed to the content of the course at that time, and the adaptability of the pilot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Bankruptcy Branch was upgraded to a Division with the Official Receiver's Offices in the States becoming Branches, thus enabling better sectionalising to be able to more effectively and efficiently manage the workload. The Division is now known as the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. Extensive changes were made to the procedures for handling the administration of bankrupt estates resulting in a substantial reduction in the necessary work in approximately 60% of the estates. This was achieved through the application of cost effectiveness and risk management principles. Changes were also made to many other aspects of the operational policies and practices used, which whilst minor in themselves, amounted in total to a revitalised and forward looking bankruptcy and Official Trustee administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Law Reform Commission did present a report about insolvency in 1988, known as the Harmer Report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The survey was conducted by the Western Australian Department of Health at the request of the National Food Authority. The survey sampled 96 lead soldered cans, 84 welded cans and four aluminium cans. The cans which were selected were most likely to be lead contaminated i.e. soldered cans; older cans; and those containing acidic food. The study found that the mean level of lead in food packaged in soldered cans was almost nine times, not nineteen times, the mean level of lead in food packaged in welded cans. However, only six out of 184 samples exceeded the Maximum Permitted Concentration (MPC) of lead in foods. It should be noted that the proportion of lead soldered cans in the study is far greater than the proportion of lead soldered cans in the market-place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) The Australian Food Standards Code sets out the MPCs of lead in foods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1-16) There is a requirement under the Madrid Protocol for the huskies to be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area. The decision to transfer the huskies to operators in the USA was based on a judgement as to what was in the best interests of the dogs, including maintaining them as working teams, suitable climate and the operators' proven records of managing the dogs as working teams under conditions similar to those at Mawson. Australian proposals were fully investigated before a decision was made to transfer the dogs to North America. The Antarctic animal ethics committee agreed that the North American option was the best in terms of the welfare of the dogs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US operators have been advised that they will be sent nineteen dogs and three pups and have made decisions on the basis of this advice. The removal of the dogs from Mawson is timed by reference to the circumstances for settling the dogs in North America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the Audit Act have been complied with and the procedures followed are appropriate and proper. There is no formal contract which establishes specific conditions for the transfer, nor will the Commonwealth receive any payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inspection team, including representatives of the RSPCA, the Antarctic animal ethics committee and a veterinarian, further examined options for the placement in Australia of the pups and older dogs which were beyond working age. It was made clear to Australian operators during this second inspection that the purpose of the inspection was to consider options to place the three pups and the older dogs and I am advised that the members of that team consider that nothing was said or done which could give rise to an expectation that the huskies would be given to any particular kennel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been decided that the older dogs will be left in Antarctica for the present and at the end of the 1993-94 season the remaining dogs will be returned to Australia. A decision on the location and housing of these dogs will be deferred until closer to the time, but again it will be made in the best interests of the dogs' welfare in consultation with the ethics committee. I see no point in pursuing those options at this time and possibly raising false expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British Government has advised that it is committed fully to the implementation of the Madrid Protocol and will be reviewing its position before the April 1994 date prescribed in the Protocol. As the honourable member is no doubt aware Argentina, the only other nation with dogs in the Antarctic, is already removing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is irresponsible and insulting to expeditioners to suggest that it could prejudice the maintenance of "good order and discipline" or that the dogs' lives would be put at risk in the manner suggested.</PARA>

Once those consultations have been completed, the responsibility for preparation and submission of the necessary documents to the Executive Council for approval is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The equipment and material provided by Australia to Papua New Guinea under the Defence Co-operation Program is to help maintain and develop the capabilities of the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) to carry out its nation-wide tasks, rather than for any specific situation. This includes, inter alia, PNGDF operations on Bougainville, where the PNG Government is dealing with an armed secessionist movement. Apart from the provision of the Iroquois helicopters, for which conditions of use were agreed between the two Governments, it is up to Papua New Guinea, as an independent and sovereign country, to decide where and how its defence assets are employed to carry out national security functions. Papua New Guinea understands that Australia expects the equipment we have supplied to be used in a way which is consistent with the purposes for which it has been given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) and (b) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) Iroquois helicopters, Attack class Patrol Boats and Pacific Patrol Boats</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Four Iroquois helicopters were supplied to Papua New Guinea in 1989. A replacement helicopter was delivered in September 1992 for one of the four which crashed in the Highlands in March 1991. Australia handed over four Attack class Patrol Boats to Papua New Guinea at Independence in 1975. As these boats approached the end of their productive life, they were replaced with four Pacific Patrol Boats which were handed over to Papua New Guinea between 1987 and 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I understand that the PNGDF has used its helicopters and patrol boats for operations on and near Bougainville. As I noted in my answer to (1) above, the PNG Government has responsibility for the conduct of operations by its security forces on Bougainville. Conditions of use have been agreed between the two Governments only in the case of the helicopters supplied by Australia. These provide for the helicopters to be used for troop transportation, for patrolling and surveillance activities, and for medical evacuation purposes, and allow for defensive fire from the helicopters for self-protection. We have sought, and received, assurances from the PNG Government that these conditions are being adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 generally prohibits Australian citizens and residents from preparing for, or engaging in, hostile activities in foreign countries. Service in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign state does not constitute an offence under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Section 9 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 prohibits the recruitment in Australia of persons to serve in or with foreign armed forces, except where a declaration is made under subsection 9 (2) of the Act. On 20 July 1989, Mr Bowen made such a declaration to permit the recruitment of personnel for the purpose of facilitating the use of 4 Iroquois helicopters supplied to the Papua New Guinea Government by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) As part of the agreement for the supply of the helicopters in 1989, Australia undertook to provide up to $1 million annually for three years for contract flying and servicing of the helicopters. The funds have been drawn on by the PNG Department of Defence to contract a PNG firm to operate and maintain the helicopters. I understand that some of the civilians employed by the firm are Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Australia has agreed to provide up to $1 million this financial year as the PNGDF does not yet have a sufficient number of suitably qualified personnel to take over the operation and maintenance of the helicopters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Funds of $0.798 million and $0.970 million were provided to Papua New Guinea in 1990-91 and 1991-92 respectively to enable the PNG Department of Defence to pay for the contract flying and servicing of the helicopters. Up to $1 million is available this financial year for the same purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of reports of such a statement, but I have not seen a copy of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Access to Bougainville by all persons, including journalists, is controlled by the PNG Government. This does not mean that journalists are prevented from visiting Bougainville;  in recent weeks, journalists from the ABC, Channel 9 and `The Age' newspaper have visited centres in North Solomons Province. I am not aware of any journalists in the Province at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) I am advised that an ABC crew, after a stay of several days, was required by PNG security forces to leave Bougainville on 17 October 1992. I understand that this action resulted from a misunderstanding on the part of the PNG security forces in Bougainville about the permitted duration of the crew's visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The Australian Government maintains that the Bougainville issue, including travel to and from the island, is an internal matter for the Papua New Guinea Government. As noted above, a number of journalists and media crews have visited the island during recent weeks. I also note that a special position has been created within the PNG Prime Minister's department to facilitate media coverage of the Bougainville issue. During discussions with their PNG counterparts over recent months, my Ministers have consistently encouraged the PNG Government to keep open lines of communication on Bougainville.</PARA>

However prior to going ahead with its investment, the AWB consulted the Grains Council of Australia, which approved the project and the use of WIF moneys to finance the acquisition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) I am advised by the AWB that the feasibility study looked at both the pulp paper industry as a whole and the particular industry segments in which the planned Moora project would compete.

Under this arrangement any future projects will be assessed against criteria which have been developed by the AWB. There is no Ministerial involvement in the development or approval of these Plans and this arrangement recognises that the WIF is an industry fund made up from a levy on wheat growers. The Government's main involvement with the WIF is the provision of a five year (until 30 June 1994) $100m guarantee for WIF related borrowings.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 8 October 1992 I announced a package of initiatives for the grains industry which would provide a framework for growth to the end of the decade. One element of that package is the continuation of the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) until June 1999 in order to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provide a capital base for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to fund its future activities, in particular the making of advance payments to growers at the end of the build up period without the need for Government guarantees</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">fund investment and participation in grains related value adding activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WIF will continue to be largely funded by the Wheat Industry Fund levy which, subject to certain exemptions, is collected on wheat sold or delivered by a producer and on wheat which is processed by or for a producer. The current rate of levy to fund the WIF is 2% of "farmgate"  sales value, which is the minimum specified in the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. This rate will continue unless the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) representing Australia's wheat growers makes a recommendation to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for an increase in the rate. During the course of comprehensive discussions with the GCA on the elements and detail of the package, the GCA stated that the issue of raising the WIF levy above 2% was not on its agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Since the levy is calculated on the sales value of wheat net of storage, transport, handling and f.o.b. costs, the amount of levy paid in any year will vary widely between producers. Similarly, the amount of levy paid as a proportion of farm cash income will depend on the individual farm business and in particular the contribution that wheat sales make to that figure. However, on the basis of data showing average levy per tonne paid on wheat delivered to the AWB (as published in the AWB's Annual Report), and figures for average wheat production per farm and Farm Cash Income (as published in the Farm Surveys Report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics) it is estimated that on average, total WIF levy paid is around 3% of Farm Cash Income for specialist crop farms in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Wheat Industry Fund levy was introduced in July 1989. In the following year wheat plantings increased by 2.4%. This would suggest that it is unlikely that the continuation of that levy will lead to a reduction in the area planted to wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area sown to wheat in any season is a function of many factors but it would appear that the expected price for wheat compared to that for other crops and livestock products has a major influence on growers' decisions. For example, a report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in its June 1992 "Crop Report" shows that since 1983/84 there appears to have been a direct trade-off between cropping and sheep production. In respect of 1992-93 winter crops, that same report also suggested that as a result of improved prices compared with what farmers expected prior to sowing in the previous season (1991-92), farmers were increasing the proportion of cropland planted to wheat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to close Brisbane MIRO was taken after detailed analysis of the workload of all MIRO offices and the staff resources available to handle that workload. The analysis took account of the declining workload (applications to be received are anticipated to fall from 7814 in 1991-92 to 6000 in 1992-93), increased productivity requirements and reductions in the overall MIRO staff level by 28 per cent in 1992-93.</PARA>

Both South Australia and Western Australia had a number of staff available to be transferred to review work. Expansion of these MIROs allowed the placement of these staff who otherwise may have become surplus.
