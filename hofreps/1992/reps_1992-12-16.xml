<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the thirteenth to the twenty-first reports of the Committee for 1992 relating to: development of RAAF base Scherger at Peppan, Cape York Peninsula, Queensland; construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Suva, Republic of Fiji; construction of Australian Embassy staff apartments at Attakarn Prasit, Bangkok, Thailand; redevelopment of Lavarack Army barracks in Townsville, stage 1; storage/display facility for the Australian War Memorial at Mitchell, ACT; Badgerys Creek Airport development, stage 1; development of a new international terminal complex at Brisbane Airport; York Park offices, Barton, ACT; and relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong, NSW.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the House. The nine reports I have just tabled conclude an extremely busy year for the Committee, particularly in the period since August. The value of the projects in these nine reports is approximately $750m. The Public Works Committee has always prided itself on its bipartisan nature. In fact, until today, in the five years that I have been Chairman there has been only one dissenting report and that dissenting report was by two Government members. Today, we have two dissenting reports with the Committee being split on party political lines. I think it is a pity, and I hope it is not a fact, that the closer we come to an election the less bipartisan the Committee appears to become.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available this morning, I do not propose to talk at length about each project but to mention a number of the more important issues which arose during the inquiries. While the Committee has recommended that the projects in both Suva and Bangkok proceed, it has reluctantly given its approval because it has been unable to carry out site inspections and therefore has been unable to properly assess each proposal. I urge the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to give urgent consideration to the Committee's request to amend the Public Works Committee Act 1969 to remove the restrictions on the Committee meeting outside Australia and its external territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Badgerys Creek Airport proposal, the Committee has recommended that the FAC stage 1 proposal not proceed but be replaced by an expanded stage 1 proposal. The expanded stage 1 proposal recommended by the Committee should include a 2,900-metre runway and not the 1,800-metre runway as proposed by the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While agreeing that there is a need for a second major airport in the Sydney basin and that Badgerys Creek is the most suitable location for such an airport, the Committee has concluded that the FAC proposal places too much emphasis on passenger demand and does not take account of the potential growth of freight services to the Asia-Pacific region or the scope for industrial growth in the western region of Sydney. However, the Committee believes that the $152m estimate provided by the FAC for a Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils type proposal is more realistic than the $42.46m estimate provided by the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the Committee believes that the initial development at Badgerys Creek should include a 2,900-metre runway with the minimum associated infrastructure necessary to allow for both domestic and international operations. This should include the provision of navigational and visual aids and an instrument landing system. Essentially, after considering the evidence placed before it, the Committee has concluded that the FAC's stage 1 proposal is inadequate and unlikely to attract potential users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that an expanded stage 1 proposal proceed, the Committee has also recommended that the FAC should seek additional Commonwealth funding. However, should the Government be unwilling to provide the necessary additional funding, a consortium, including Federal and State government bodies, local government, through the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, and other interested parties, should be formed to develop and operate Badgerys Creek Airport through private funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh report I have tabled relates to the construction of a new international terminal complex at Brisbane Airport which is long overdue, I might add. The out-turn cost of the proposed work is $272m. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed as planned. It should be remembered that the Committee, and indeed the Parliament, had already approved the preparation of the proposed site some two kilometres from the new domestic terminal in 1989. In arriving at its recommendation that construction should proceed, the Committee examined a number of important matters against the background of the Government's recently announced aviation policy reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The siting of the new terminal, the capacity of the existing domestic terminal to handle international flights, two competing terminals and the views of the aviation industry were all examined by the Committee. In fact, the Committee considered the various options at great length, including the expansion of the existing domestic terminal and a stand alone international terminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terminal design concept has a three-level configuration of 53,000 square metres and will provide seven aerobridge gates, four stand-off positions, four baggage reclaim units and three check-in islands. The main body of the proposed building will be designed to process 1,500 passengers per hour, although the initial capacity will be for 1,065 passengers per hour. The Federal Airports Corporation assured the Committee that additional aerobridge positions could be added quickly to cater for any increases in demand without disrupting the activity of the terminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for the construction of the York Park offices for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a site in Barton, ACT, is one that has aroused considerable controversy. Indeed, the Opposition members on the Committee have dissented from the Committee's report. I must say that I was somewhat surprised to read extensive quotations from the dissenting report in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. However, the Committee is satisfied that, on the evidence presented to it, the York Park proposal appears to be the most economical of the proposals considered for providing alternative accommodation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.The Committee concluded that the Administrative Building requires extensive refurbishment to meet current standards for Commonwealth Public Service office accommodation, particularly in the areas of fire safety, building services and occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the York Park site, the Committee believes that it is appropriate for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is a key policy department, to be located close to Parliament House. The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue consultations on a regular basis with staff and staff associations during the design, development and construction of the York Park proposal and, in particular, in relation to the provision of child-care facilities. The Committee has recommended that the York Park project proceed at an estimated cost of $186.832m at April 1992 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat amusing when politicians who occupy offices in this building refer to other buildings in Canberra as Taj Mahals. I am convinced that in the criticism of this project there is, unfortunately, an element of Canberra bashing. Also, it is interesting that my Opposition colleagues point out that public expenditure is under extreme pressure; and that is correct. They object to spending $187m on the York Park project in Canberra, but have no hesitation in agreeing to expenditure of $166m for a bare base airfield on the Cape York Peninsula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report I have tabled relates to the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong at an estimated cost of $12.5m. This is also a project that has aroused some controversy, and I acknowledge that the Opposition members of the Committee have dissented from the Committee's report. The Australian Hydrographic Office is currently located in unsatisfactory accommodation in Walker Street, North Sydney, and there was general agreement that the Australian Hydrographic Office requires new accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controversy surrounds the issue of loss of staff which may result from the transfer to Wollongong. However, the Department of Defence believes that the possible extent of staff losses will not be determined conclusively until all staff have exercised their election to relocate or not. Defence has acknowledged that the production rate of charts could slow for a period during and immediately following the move. However, Defence does not believe that safety of life at sea will be compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearing, the Committee was told about the possible loss of key personnel. This argument is always presented when it is suggested that a government department or instrumentality move from a capital city to a decentralised location. It is an argument that I reject; some staff might leave, but there is always a turnover of staff in any organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Australian Hydrographic Office could be carried out in almost any location with access to modern communication facilities. The Sydney site at Leichhardt, which the Committee inspected, would have a motorway three storeys high cutting through one corner of the block and be directly under the approach flight path of Sydney Airport&mdash;some location.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having considered all the evidence, the Committee is satisfied that the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong will not adversely affect its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to mention briefly the reports relating to the development of RAAF base Scherger near Weipa on the Cape York Peninsula and the stage 1 redevelopment of Lavarack Army barracks at Townsville. RAAF base Scherger, which will be developed at a cost of $166.65m, is an important project as it will complete the chain of RAAF airfields across the north of Australia and provide a base for the deployment and coverage of the sea-air gap during a contingency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stage 1 redevelopment of the Lavarack Army barracks at Townsville at a cost of $23.433m is a topical development as Lavarack Barracks is the home of the Ready Deployment Force, elements of which it was announced yesterday will be sent to Somalia to assist with the United Nations relief mission. The Committee wishes it well on that important path. Mr Speaker, I have pleasure in commending these nine reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to comment on three or four of the defence related reports that the Public Works Committee has brought down today. In relation to the Royal Australian Air Force base Scherger in Queensland, we welcome this Public Works Committee report on the proposal to develop the bare base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the development of an air base on the Cape York Peninsula is an important part of any northern defence strategy. This proposal was initially put forward by the Fraser Government prior to the 1983 election. It says something about both defence budgets and the speed of defence planning as it is only now that we have really got the work approved by the Public Works Committee. In the event of a defence contingency in the Australian north, this base will play a significant role in providing a point for logistic and maintenance support as well as for tactical air operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With RAAF base Tindal in the Northern Territory and the bare base at Derby in Western Australia, an air base on the Cape York Peninsula will complete the chain of Air Force bases in the north. This is a worthwhile defence objective and one which signals Australia's commitment to develop a significant defence presence in the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to one aspect of the Committee's work and that is the question of the location of the facility relative to the Cape York spaceport proposal. I raised this when the matter was first brought before the House. I would like to thank the Committee for addressing this issue. I note the report concludes that there is scope for cooperation between the two entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it does not compromise the operation of Scherger as a RAAF base, I believe that access to the landing strip on a commercial basis may be of some value in encouraging the spaceport proposal to fruition. This still leaves open the question of the additional requirement for vital asset protection which Scherger and, if it is built, the spaceport will present. I hope that the Government will take a serious look at this issue as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Public Works Committee report on the redevelopment of the Lavarack Army barracks. I do not want to take too much of the time of the House on this matter. Certainly, the coalition supports the expenditure of funds to update and modernise the facilities at Lavarack. I visited the ODF base recently. Some of the buildings are quite dilapidated and are certainly in need of replacement and upgrading. So it is not before time that the Government has correctly decided to modernise these facilities, which go back to the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ODF, particularly in its present circumstances, is entitled to decent facilities. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) pointed out, this is an appropriate time for us to discuss this issue in the House. The ODF will now get better facilities, admittedly somewhat after its return from Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 18 of the report, the Committee notes Defence plans for further capital facilities work at Lavarack outside the current Defence five-year plan. The five-year plan takes us to the end of 1988. So this section refers to unapproved work which might be carried on after that time. What is interesting about the Defence list of future work at Lavarack is that there is absolutely no mention of the facilities which would have to be built if the Government had any intention to relocate the School of Artillery from Holsworthy to Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who I am glad to see is in the House, made great play in the Townsville media at the time of the last Federal election of the proposed move of the Artillery School, which then Defence Minister Beazley announced when he visited the electorate of Herbert during the election campaign. This report conclusively proves that there is absolutely no intention whatsoever to relocate the Artillery School to Townsville. In fact, it is not even in the plans of the Defence Department for the turn of the century, let alone in the current five-year plan. I hope that the honourable member for Herbert is able to explain this to his constituents. If he chooses not to explain it to them, he can rest assured that we will be explaining it to them over and over again between now and the day of the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the controversial issue of the relocation of the Navy Hydrographic Office to Wollongong. I regret that the Labor members of the Committee have decided to support what some members of the Parliamentary Labor Party have admitted is little more than a pork-barrelling exercise. I note that there is a dissenting report signed by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Calvert about the relocation option. It is a tribute to the parliamentary process that some members, such as those three, are prepared to take an objective view of this matter, rather than being snowed by what could politely be described as political exigencies. Certainly nobody in the Illawarra area is in the slightest deceived by this political stunt. They know only too well that at the end of the day this will create very few jobs in the Illawarra. It is scant compensation for the number of jobs that Labor has destroyed in the Illawarra area over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report states quite correctly that the only reason for this proposal proceeding was that the Minister made a decision to relocate the Hydrographic Office for purely political reasons. Insufficient attention was given by the Government to the disruptive nature of the move or to the fact that the proposed office would be totally isolated from major naval facilities in Sydney. In addition, there remains universal opposition to the move to Wollongong from within Navy and the Hydrographic Office itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the coalition believes that the relocation of the office has been motivated by a shoddy attempt at pork-barrelling by the Labor Party, which is intent on trying to improve its flagging fortunes in an area that it has plunged into depression. I remind the House that when this matter was referred to the Public Works Committee I tried to table, but was not allowed to do so by the Labor Party, the Defence Department's advice to the Minister, which argued strenuously against the relocation to Leichhardt. Mr Podger, the appropriate deputy secretary from within the Department, who signed that minute, was supported all the way by the Royal Australian Navy. The documents show that Defence put Wollongong third on its list of possibilities and last in a list of three options for the relocation of the Hydrographic Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition further believes that the proposed expenditure is unacceptable without taking a closer look at the Hydrographic Service as a whole and the full range of options which may be open to doing this essential research work in other less costly ways. In saying this, I recognise that there are deficiencies in the present Walker Street offices, which I have taken the trouble to visit. However, this accommodation will suffice for the short term until the coalition, in government, determines the future for an appropriately structured Hydrographic Office. I believe that the coalition will be able to develop a Hydrographic Service which is more efficient and cost-effective than the present organisation and which will not require a costly, disruptive and utterly unnecessarily relocation to Wollongong. </PARA>

I joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1976. From the time I joined&mdash;not because of my joining&mdash;the Administrative Building in Parkes which the Department uses was continually being refurbished. There was a constant process of refurbishment. I would like to know how much has been spent on that building since the beginning of the 1970s. </PARA>

Many honourable members on the other side of the House agree with me; I know they do. It was just that little lack of courage at the end of the day that I understand persuaded the Labor members of the Public Works Committee not to support the dissenting report which would have put paid to this utterly ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The old truism that if one wants something stuffed up get the Government involved was never more applicable than it has been to the provision of aviation infrastructure in Australia over the last 20 years. In this respect may I welcome the report of the Public Works Committee on the Badgerys Creek airport development stage 1 and its report on the development of a new international terminal complex for the FAC airport in Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee should be congratulated on making what I think is a rather brave report in both these instances, and in particular on its decision to reject the proposal for stage 1 of the development of Badgerys Creek. We know that a lot of politics is being played at the moment; there will always be in these matters. The reality is that the proposal for stage 1 of Badgerys Creek was never a real proposition in terms of the proper development of that particular airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real difficulty we have had over the years is that there has been a number of changes in the nature of airport infrastructure administration through various changes in the Department and with the introduction of the FAC, but at the end of the day our record is really quite dreadful. The reality is, whether we like it or not, that there will have to be a second facility for Sydney by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are now proceeding, despite the troglodytes on the other side objecting to every move, to get the third runway in place at Sydney international airport, we are facing a situation where, by the end of this decade, that second facility will be required. On the present projections of traffic inflow into Australia, we will receive something like seven million international visitors by that year, with about 60 per cent of them going through Sydney. That will mean almost a tripling of the international airline capacity coming into Australia at that time and an increase in domestic capacity of about two or 2 1/2 times. Clearly, even with the third runway and the constraints that are on Kingsford-Smith Airport, it would be very difficult for us to even remotely suggest that we could handle that sort of growth, despite the introduction of new air traffic control systems and new air traffic control facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of a new international airport is enormous. In the case of Badgerys Creek, I have no doubt that by the end of the day we are probably looking at a $10 billion development. Despite the controversy that has been going on about the location of Badgerys Creek, quite frankly I do not think we have many other options. I was delighted to see that the Public Works Committee in its report suggested at one stage that it should look perhaps at a joint development between private enterprise and the FAC to get this airport under way. I think that is the first step in the right direction. Obviously, from my point of view, the Government should look at the total privatisation of the Badgerys Creek airport development. It can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of what has been achieved, or what is being achieved, overseas in terms of the private development of airports. I cite the example of Denver, Colorado, where there is this huge airport for a city of about 1.5 million people. While it is a hub, and while there are greater air traffic flows in the United States, I think it is a good example of what can be done. On 1 October 1989 the airport authority, which is a private group made up of local government and others, decided to let the contracts for the development of the new Denver Airport. It is under way and will open on 1 October 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four years to build a major international airport is not too bad. It will not be finished on 1 October 1993, though, because only six runways will be operating by then. It is to have a total capacity of 15 runways and a passenger handling capacity of 200 million per year. We have taken about 25 years to make a decision on the third runway in Sydney. Getting through the environmental impact statements took longer than it took to reconstruct Kuwait Airport after the war. But Denver shows what can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financing of that airport was really quite interesting. In the United States there is a passenger ticket tax which is put towards the development of airports. Only half a billion dollars of the Federal ticket tax went into the development of Denver; the rest of it was raised on a public float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first three floats resulted in an oversubscription by the general public of the area, and the fourth float was held up for some time while the situation regarding Continental Airlines was sorted out. It has now gone on and that airport is completely funded. I believe that the establishment of a private consortium to develop Badgerys Creek is probably the way to go so that we can get it off the ground by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also be aware that the position overseas now is that airports are developed further from the inner city. In the case of Denver the airport is about 35 miles from the centre of town. Another interesting one is Stansted in the United Kingdom, which is the third airport for London, which is exactly the same distance from the centre of London as is Badgerys Creek from the centre of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we can talk about this private development of Badgerys Creek&mdash;and that is the way we should go&mdash;we have to realise that an awful lot of public infrastructure will have to be put in. High speed rail links, water supply and sewerage systems, oil and fuel supplies are going to amount to a lot of money. If we are going to be serious about the development of these airports, obviously there will still be a role for government to play in that regard, but the principle of getting it out for private tender as soon as possible will be very much at the forefront of the Federal coalition's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment briefly on the decision of the Committee to go ahead with the development of the new international terminal complex at Brisbane International Airport. I do not know how many times over the years I have risen in this place to talk about the disaster that is Brisbane International Airport, and particularly the terminal. Obviously the Public Works Committee had a very difficult role to play in relation to that airport, especially with the changes of policy. At the end of the day, it has probably come down with the right decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real difficulty regarding that international terminal probably goes back to a previous Public Works decision of the early 1980s, when it was decided not to proceed with the development of the international terminal, which originally was to be part of the major terminal complex. It is obvious now that we are going to have a terminal one, terminal two situation in Brisbane, with all the difficulties and inconveniences that that causes with people having to ply between the different terminals to make connections with the flights. But as so much money was invested, against my better judgment, I must say, in the provision of the sandfill at the Brisbane airport and the fact that something has to be done in Brisbane in a hurry and that there is room to expand, the decision is probably the right one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put governments of the future on notice in light of the fact that one of the things we have not been very good at in the past is being able to project the possible traffic growth. The reason that the new terminal in Brisbane did not go ahead in the early 1980s was that they could not see any traffic requirement until 1993. It looks as though we are going to go to 1995 or 1996 at best to get it on line. No consideration was taken as to the effect of the Commonwealth Games and, of course, Expo, and the growth in tourism. Therefore, I put future governments on notice with this prediction. I am not being big headed about it, but some of my predictions might have been a bit closer to the mark than those of some of the powers that be in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Brisbane is going to become the number two airport to Sydney by the turn of this century. I would not be at all surprised, when the present growth patterns are studied, if we actually reach that by about 1998. When we look at the decision of Air New Zealand to put a hub in over Brisbane, with 58 flights a week from that airline alone going through the place within the next two or three years; when we look at the tremendous expansion of the Japanese market and what Qantas is doing by introducing direct flights; when we look at the applications from companies such as North-West Airlines and the fact that United is coming on stream into Brisbane with more and more flights, it is pretty obvious that the major growth in international traffic is going to happen in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see in that report that, while a reference was made to the seven air bridges and the 11 hard standing areas, the Committee acknowledged that there may be a need for some very rapid expansion of the Brisbane terminal. I hope that governments of the future do take that into consideration too, because the last thing that we would want to happen in an airport such as Brisbane is the disaster with the delays that have happened in Sydney. To that extent, I extend my congratulations to the Committee, its Chairman and members and, indeed, the secretariat, for what I think were very well considered and vitally important decisions on these two aspects of the provision of aviation infrastructure. </PARA>

But it was the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who was reported as putting a slight snide caveat on the deployment by suggesting that somehow or other it would leave Australia's domestic defence capabilities `dangerously thin'. I know that soldiers in the 6th Brigade and 1 Brigade reading that waffle would take serious umbrage at that statement that taking 900 soldiers from the Australian Defence Force, capable as they are, will leave this country's defences dangerously thin to conduct necessary operations in our region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His snide remarks this morning about the School of Artillery announced by one of Australia's outstanding Ministers for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), before the last Federal election deserve some comment.

At great expense, an environmental impact study has been carried out, costing nearly $1m. That property is now owned by the Department of Defence and all the necessary environmental requirements have been completed satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement by the honourable member for Swan was in line with the shift to the north of our defence capability that has been going on unabated since 1983. His statements about a so-called report containing no reference to the Government's future intentions with respect to what will happen to the School of Artillery are meaningless.

Those words relate to the processes that will be involved in the privatisation of those operations.

As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said in his remarks a few moments ago, if the Federal Airports Corporation's approach remains inadequate, then the Government should be encouraging Federal, State and local governments to get together with other interested parties in order to arrange private funding of the operations of Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>

For that reason, the coalition has been urging the Government to look closely at the possibility of privatising the Federal Airports Corporation airports. That is our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few more remarks about this, but I want to lead into them by quoting from an article on the privatisation of Qantas from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 11 December this year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas trade sale campaign, in which a share in Qantas is being discussed with other international operators, is proving a tortuous and confused process. It has been . . . described by one of the potential buyers as "a bunch of rank amateurs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The `bunch of rank amateurs' is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), and the former Minister for Transport and Communications, now Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who, over a period of years now, have brought Qantas through this tortuous and confused process and are behaving like a bunch of rank amateurs. I cannot put Senator Collins completely in this class; he has just fallen into bad company. I want to quote what Senator Collins had to say in respect of privatisation. In the Senate on 7 December during the second reading debate on the Qantas Sale Bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same applies to our airports. I am not suggesting that some airports may not at some future time be improved by sale. For example, at some future time when the second Sydney airport is truly competitive with the existing airport in Sydney, it may well be in the national interest to sell both airports.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins is signalling that the Government will change its mind about airports in the same way as it has changed its mind about most of the privatisations that it has started to undertake. I say to Senator Collins that the condition precedent for privatising does not have to be a competitive market; it can also be a contestable market. As a result of this report by the Public Works Committee, we now have a contestable market emerging in Sydney. In those circumstances there is no reason why the Government should not proceed to the privatisation not only of Badgerys Creek, but also the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to understand that airports are really only pieces of real estate. It is true that they can exercise a monopoly position with regard to the provision of aviation services. No government would allow them to abuse that monopoly position. Any part of the operations of a government business enterprise that could exercise monopoly powers would necessarily require, as part of the privatisation, some form of cap on the charges in order to protect the public against abuse of those monopoly powers. But there are no monopoly operations with regard to businesses that might be set up in and around airports, wholesale and retail operations in airports, and education and training. None of these situations are monopoly situations. Under those circumstances, provided there is appropriate protection for the travelling public against the monopoly situation with regard to aviation services, there is no reason at all why the Government should not take advantage of the trigger provided by this report and move to the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, we would prefer to see the $270m being spent by the private sector in the Brisbane international terminal. There will be a need to dovetail that in, with the eventual privatisation of Brisbane Airport, where there is some competition at the margin, perhaps with the Coolangatta Airport. We would prefer to see the construction, ownership, control and operations of that terminal also being in the hands of the private sector. </PARA>

Bill Kelty said to Senator Collins, `Just give us our airport'. Why? Because he, the Committee and others in Melbourne are convinced that the best interests of Melbourne and the State of Victoria will be served by having the ownership and control of Tullamarine Airport in the hands of local interests and, we would say, private interests. </PARA>

It has always been a disappointment to me that we did not decide to put a massive airport in initially at Badgerys Creek, capable of taking us into the twenty-first century and beyond. But we have to move on; the third runway decision has been taken. One cannot say it was with a very fulsome public discussion and involvement process, but that decision has passed us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now turn to Badgerys Creek. I think I reflect some of the pleasure of the people in the western suburbs when I endorse the Committee's report by saying that what we really need for Sydney and tourism is a robust competition policy in relation to Badgerys Creek. For that, we need a couple of things. Firstly, we do not need both airports being run by one organisation. In that regard, the FAC will always seek to recoup its sunk investment in Kingsford-Smith Airport. We will never be free of the suspicion that it would wish to hold back the development of Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that stage one at Badgerys Creek be deferred and that we go for a larger runway at Kingsford-Smith capable of taking both domestic and international traffic, and that the FAC approach the Government for the money. In the current budgetary circumstances that is going to be difficult, but the report provides the fall-back option of seeking private involvement in Badgerys Creek, something I am on the public record as having advocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly welcome the report. I certainly hope the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) and the Cabinet will give it the full consideration that it so richly deserves. I am sure it is going to lead to a lot of discussion and involvement by the people of western Sydney, who realise that, given a chance, we will be able to see a more rapid development than possibly officials from DOTAC have to date envisaged. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) about the estimates of traffic. Whatever the potential for attracting additional airline traffic into Sydney, it will be maximised only if we have a robust, competitive policy which allows Badgerys Creek to compete, as it will, with Kingsford-Smith. That requires a runway which will take both domestic and international traffic and be managed by an organisation other than the FAC. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to confine my remarks to the York Park proposal, which the Opposition opposes, for an expenditure of some $186.8m, plus the $80m-odd that will be required to upgrade the existing building. The proposal is for a new building containing 46,000 square metres of useable floor area. Of that amount, 41,000 square metres will be allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with an additional amount of 5,300-odd square metres to be taken up by Austrade. The report of the Public Works Committee said that the 7,000 square metres required by AIDAB could not be accommodated in this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report put down by my colleagues the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Senator Paul Calvert, senator for Tasmania, pointed out that the proposal for the construction of a high security annex, which they have suggested should be fully investigated, was at a far lower cost of $102m all-up. The advantages of this proposal are that there would be a substantially lower cost and that it would provide an additional 14,000 square metres of floor area, plus 240 additional car parking spaces. The cost of the Government's proposal&mdash;$187m, or all-up $267m&mdash;is excessive and exorbitant, particularly in these very difficult times. The new proposal for York Park has been described by some as `Gareth's Gazebo'. It is totally inappropriate in these times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant point to be raised with regard to the York Park development is that, while it is a substantially bigger building, it provides the same net useable floor area. That would seem to be a complete waste of money. I have expressed my concerns in this chamber before about the lack of involvement, consultation and use of expertise in the private sector with regard to this proposal. That point was also highlighted in my colleagues' minority report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another dimension to the York Park proposal is that private enterprise has not been given the opportunity to compete for the right to design and develop a building able to meet the accommodations needs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My colleagues went on to point out that those accommodation needs could be met far more competitively in the proposal they  put forward. That is a view which the Opposition supports. We consider that the annex building should be fully investigated because it is far more cost-efficient and it would provide an additional 14,000 square metres of floor area, plus an additional 240 car parking spaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our major concern is that the York Park proposal, as submitted by the Committee, is for an all-up expenditure of $267m for a building that is larger while only providing the same net lettable floor area as the present building&mdash;a building that the Department is saying is inadequate, does not provide the accommodation space that people working in the building require and is cramped because of insufficient space. We would have to ask the question: why build a building at such enormous cost and of such large proportions that does not meet the needs of the clients for additional floor area? For that reason, the Opposition opposes this expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the report of the Public Works Committee relating to the relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong, New South Wales&mdash;a relocation which I was at the forefront in pursuing when it came to my knowledge some 12 months ago that the Navy was planning to move from North Sydney. This matter was drawn to my attention by the news editor of one of Wollongong's television stations. He had heard it at a private party and suggested that, given the state of the economy and the depths of the recession in the Illawarra region, as an employment generating proposition this proposal may be pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The news editor was somewhat taken aback when I decided that he was absolutely right and that the proposal to decentralise this particular operation&mdash;and, indeed, any other Commonwealth operation&mdash;out of a major city was a proposal which I had personally been supporting for quite a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history books will show that, as a result of intensive lobbying&mdash;and I make no apology for that as the local member representing Wollongong&mdash;and that as a result of a consistent effort by Wollongong City Council to meet the needs expressed in the brief put forward by the Department of Defence in respect of the requirements of the Hydrographic Office in Wollongong and in response to a demonstrated need in an economic and social sense for this particular project to proceed, we were successful. We were successful in that today the Public Works Committee has brought down a report which recommends for good, strong, economic and social reasons that the Hydrographic Office be relocated to Wollongong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some three years ago, an organisation called the Illawarra Regional Consultative Council was formed in Wollongong. This council brought together representatives of the local community&mdash;representatives of business, trade unions and government. It was chaired by me under the auspices of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. The idea was to develop an economic strategy for the Illawarra region which would be a guide to government, to business, to the trade union movement and to the community of the Illawarra in an effort to bring together those major players to ensure that we could get on the road to economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations in that strategy report went to this particular issue of the decentralisation of Federal Government offices out of Sydney and attracting them to regional cities such as Wollongong. Specifically, the Australian Taxation Office was mentioned in that report. I am pleased to say in passing that that proposal was supported by the Government and construction is at present under way in Wollongong just around the corner from the proposed location of the Hydrographic Office that we are debating here this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decentralisation policy could be extended to embrace any government entity. When we consider issues of this nature, it is important that we do not simply look at the dollars and cents; we need to give consideration to other factors such as the economic and social conditions prevailing in different parts of Australia and whether or not it is the responsibility of government to take those factors into consideration when making a location decision. I am pleased to say that those factors obviously have been taken into consideration in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the Illawarra is a region which has suffered considerably because of the industrial restructuring that is taking place in Australia. In Wollongong private enterprise has implemented policies to make major industries more efficient, to work smarter and to become technologically advanced but with the unfortunate consequence of reduced employment opportunities. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his contribution as shadow spokesman on defence issues, talked about the Navy's relocation proposal for the Hydrographic Office using terms such as `pork-barrelling' and `a political stunt'. He said that few jobs would be created and that this would add to the miserable record of Labor, which has destroyed jobs in the Illawarra in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a long term resident of Wollongong and as the local member who represents that city in this Parliament, I am offended by those remarks. It was not the Labor Government that decided in 1983 to slash the work force at BHP from 23,000 to a present day total of fewer than 7,000 employees; it was the company that made that decision. It was also the company's decision, through the steel industry plan which this Government put in place and which in fact saved the steel industry in this country, to invest $1.8 billion to re-equip its plant. This necessarily led to fewer job opportunities through a massive restructuring and downsizing of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than criticising the Labor Government for causing job losses in that industry in the past 10 years, I think people should reflect that if there had not been a steel industry plan we would not be talking about a steel industry in this country at all. It was not the Labor Government which saw massive restructuring in our other main industry in the Illawarra, the coal industry, which saw 3 1/2 thousand coalminers' jobs lost in the last eight years or so because of efficiency drives, the fact that geological conditions underground meant that coal seams were no longer workable and so on. It is absolute arrant nonsense to suggest that it was and that it is Labor which has destroyed jobs in Wollongong. It is a simple fact that a major industrial city and complex&mdash;that is, Wollongong, Port Kembla and the Illawarra region in general&mdash;have undergone major industrial restructuring and micro-economic reform that we hear about so often which has resulted in much of the rise in unemployment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also quite nonsensical for the honourable member for Mayo to suggest that this decision produced an outcome whereby a naval facility was isolated from other naval facilities in the immediate area. As has been stated by the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works and other honourable members in discussions this morning, Wollongong is in fact 80 kilometres from Sydney and the existing major naval facility in Sydney Harbour. It is a little more than 80 kilometres from another major naval facility at Jervis Bay. How then can it be isolated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also located adjacent to a major technological area of BHP's operations. This was a major selling point for Wollongong in attracting this facility to our region. There is also a major university which is at the forefront of technology encompassing a lot of the work that would be necessary in order for the Hydrographic Office to operate. It is absolute nonsense to say that there would be massive dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Opposition members have submitted a dissenting report and referred to the fact that the Wollongong option would be disruptive and would have an adverse effect on the morale of key technical staff. So what? If the decision is taken to decentralise a facility of this nature people will have to move out of Sydney to the south coast which has a far better environment than Sydney. It is cheaper to live; the cost of living is a lot less, in terms of housing and other matters. But people are complaining about that. I do not know what they want, quite frankly. Rather than being, as is described by the honourable member for Mayo, pork-barrelling and a political stunt with few job creation opportunities, in fact this decision is an act of a caring, compassionate government which is in tune with the specific needs of a local region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $12.5m that will be invested in the building of the new facility will have an enormous multiplier effect in the Illawarra region. The 100 jobs that will be created when the building is completed&mdash;most of the people will be transferred from Sydney; but, if we are to believe those on the other side, this is not the case&mdash;will open up opportunities for Wollongong based people. I think that should be applauded rather than denigrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, the fact that the honourable member for Mayo and the shadow spokesman for sport, Senator Michael Baume, have come out and publicly opposed Wollongong as an option demonstrates what the Liberals have always thought of regions like the Illawarra and cities like Wollongong: they could not care less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They could not care less that the unemployment rate at the moment is about 13.8 per cent, marginally above the national average. They could not care less that industrial restructuring has gone on in that part of the world and that this is an opportunity to generate meaningful employment through construction which will have an enormous multiplier effect by that amount of money being generated in the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to those people both on the other side of this House and indeed in the local Illawarra community who have chips on their shoulders. An issue which is often reflected in respect of previous State Labor Governments is that Wollongong never gets anything. Here is tangible proof that Wollongong does get something from Labor. If we add to that the $20m worth of building, the 275-plus jobs that will be created in the regional office of the Australian Taxation Office building which is under construction at the moment, the Commonwealth office block, the grain handling facility, the steel industry plan, all the sporting facilities that have been created through Federal Government assistance, and all the other things that have come from the Federal Labor Government, I would just ask those cynical people in Wollongong to have a second thought. This is a proposal which is welcomed by the people of the Illawarra, by the people of Wollongong. It is something which we desperately need. We look forward to its approval here in the Parliament later today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the amendments to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 sets out to reduce the amount of information which banks must provide about unclaimed moneys under the Banking Act. The amendment reflects the Government's experience that the name and address of a solicitor acting on behalf of an estate of a deceased person is not necessary, since the banks are already responsible for checking the bona fides of any claimants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant amendment serves to add the names `Commonwealth Savings Bank', `Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia' and `CSB' to the list of names protected under the 1959 Commonwealth Banks Act. This amendment is designed to prevent these names being appropriated for the purposes of soliciting money, in the process taking advantage of the goodwill associated with those names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the word `Commonwealth' appears to be implicit in these titles, the banks to be named would otherwise be unable to obtain the same degree of protection that is available to other banks. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has reportedly considered this matter and the States and Territories have accordingly agreed to this proposal. The only other amendment concerns a name change to one of the banks listed in the schedule to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that many of the concerns raised by me on behalf of the coalition when this Bill was originally debated in the House remain pertinent. When the Bill was debated on 4 November, I made the point that many of the taxation issues with implications for further foreign bank entry into Australia had yet to be resolved. This is despite the fact that these matters have been under active consideration for some time now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the offshore banking unit legislation has all but been passed by the Parliament, there is still more legislation required to facilitate the entry of foreign banks into Australia. Foreign banks are potentially at a disadvantage when converting existing subsidiaries in Australia into branches, because the existing law does not allow them to carry forward their losses. Some $2 billion in accumulated losses has been notched up over the past three years or so by foreign banks in Australia, and so taxation and other legislation to facilitate the conversion of those losses to operations with branch status is of great importance to the future of these banks. I am sure that the Government recognises that very pertinent fact. In fact, the Government signalled as early as June this year that the necessary legislation would be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Bill was first debated, I noted that there was still no sign of this facility and that any such legislation risked being caught up in the calling of the next Federal election. Since then, my attention has been drawn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 8 December headed `Foreign Bank Tax Talks Stall'. The article begins by noting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crucial meeting held yesterday involving Federal Government and industry representatives failed to reach agreement on key taxation issues affecting foreign banks.</PARA>
<PARA>The haggling, it would seem, is still going on. We have reached the end of the sittings for the year with no sign of the legislation that the Government said would be forthcoming as early as June this year. It is now quite likely that the Parliament will be dissolved before the next scheduled sitting in February next year, so these problems will remain unlegislated for some time. Although the Government might&mdash;and I emphasise `might'&mdash;be in a position to make an announcement about its policy before such legislation is proposed and passed, this is a very complicated area of tax law and there are grave dangers in legislating by press release, particularly given the strong possibility of a change of Government early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of all this is that despite Labor's high flying rhetoric about turning Australia into a major regional financial centre&mdash;a worthy goal which we all support&mdash;the Government has failed in its duty to provide the necessary legislative framework for that goal to be realised. The problem is that Labor spends a lot of its time talking before it gets around to acting and then fails to give appropriate priority to its actions when it has finally stopped talking and decided to do something. With those few remarks, I commend the amendments to the Committee and say that the coalition in Government looks forward to picking up where Labor has left off on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Qantas Sale Bill 1992 go to the heart of the Government's policy in regard to the extent of overseas ownership in Qantas. In considering these amendments, it is important that we should understand how we got to this point. To start, I will quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 11 December on the privatisation of Qantas and the extent of foreign ownership. The article says that the privatisation exercise is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">fraught with financial danger because it could blow up and jeopardise the goodwill of its newest clients: the passengers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From early this year, the problems of privatising Qantas became perceptible.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of Qantas, Mr Dix, is reported to have said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . negotiations over Qantas are "very transparent" to the public and nobody could afford to sell Qantas out of "desperation for funds." He says: "The Australian public would never forgive the Government if it gave away the airline at less than the full price.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Qantas trade sale campaign, in which a share in Qantas is being discussed with other international operators, is proving a tortuous and confused process. It is presided over by . . . "a bunch of rank amateurs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Now that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is in the chamber, I have to say that when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> article refers to `a bunch of rank amateurs', it is referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), formerly the Minister for Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Hawke and Keating governments, both Qantas and Australian Airlines have suffered crippling debt-equity ratios. Qantas has been allowed to remain scandalously undercapitalised by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The constant changes to the rules and timetables in the Qantas sale have frightened off potential investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The field has narrowed to two overseas bidders, which is the reason for these amendments, but the Government is too worried about the content of the bids to make them public. The Parliament and the public have the right to know what the bids are so that public opinion can prevent a fire sale of a great national asset. We cannot trust Labor governments with our money or our assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister for Finance that he is on the record consistently as saying that a trade sale bidder would have to pay a premium for entry into Qantas. Paying a premium does not mean paying a premium over the float price; it means paying a premium over the price after it had consolidated following the float. The Minister told Federal Parliament in October that the Government was not locked into a trade sale. He said that, if the bids are not good enough, we can reject all of them and make the whole sale through a float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> and discussions with British Airways and Singapore Airlines indicate quite clearly that neither of those international carriers is prepared to pay a premium for entry into Qantas. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"BA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, British Airways&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will not pay a premium under any circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is now incumbent on the Minister to make public the details of the two bids. The Australian public wants to know what the bids are; how they compare with a straight public float; who is giving the Minister advice on it; what deals the Government has done with one or both of the contenders on the side; and by what criteria the bids are to be decided. Will the Minister decide the criteria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas will go down as one of the greatest botch-ups of the Keating and Hawke years. The public has a right to know what the bids are. These things will eventually become public. The Minister for Finance and the Government should tell the Australian people what those bids are so that an assessment can be made by the Parliament and the people as to whether the Government is just giving Qantas away or whether, for the sake of the Government's budgetary difficulties, it is simply disposing of Qantas in a fire sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that these amendments go to the heart of the Government's policy to sell off 35 per cent of Qantas to overseas interests and no more than 25 per cent to one buyer. They adjust the situation in regard to the relevant interest of an overseas owner in Qantas and, for that reason, the Opposition will not oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the Committee's time for a few minutes to comment, firstly, on the amendments made by the Senate to the Qantas Sale Bill 1992 and, secondly, to address a couple of remarks made by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale). The amendments made by the Senate, which are now before the Committee, are of a technical nature and relate to the definition of the term `relevant interest'. The Bill seeks to use the concept of relevant interest from the Corporations Law to trace foreign ownership and control through company chains. Thus Qantas shares would be classified as foreign if foreigners, either directly or indirectly, have control over the voting rights of those shares or the power to dispose of them. The relevant interest concept could be used to determine the level of foreign ownership and to ensure that it stays within the limits imposed by the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, section 33 of the Corporations Law could result in a foreigner being deemed as having a relevant interest in Qantas shares held by a subsidiary of Qantas, including a subsidiary established to conduct an employee share ownership scheme. This would have had the unintended effect of adding those shares held by Qantas subsidiaries to the relevant interests of foreigners, plus inappropriately restricting the level of foreign ownership beyond that intended by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore proposed that section 33 of the Corporations Law be ignored when determining the extent of a foreigner's relevant interest in Qantas shares. These amendments, passed by the Senate and before us now, will not affect the required tracing of foreign control over voting rights through company chains. So the proposals that have come from the Senate and that were moved by the Government in the Senate are essential to overcome what would have been unintended consequences of the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition spokesman made somewhat ludicrous comments about the sale of Qantas. We are in the final stages of that trade sale process. We have bids before us from two of the three short listed bidders. Both British Airways and Singapore Airlines have submitted bids to us. The Opposition spokesman referred to us as rank amateurs and then said that we should reveal the bids. This certainly demonstrates the rank amateurish nature of the Opposition when it thinks that in a commercially sensitive situation such as this we could reveal the bids. These are very commercial, in-confidence bids and are not to be revealed to anyone whilst discussions and negotiations are going on between the Government and the bidders. We are in that process at the present time. It would be the greatest absurdity of all time for us to reveal those now. It would probably mean that both the bidders would walk away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is just a nonsense, a demonstration of the rank amateur knowledge of the circumstances, if the Opposition thinks we should be revealing the bids in these circumstances. I simply say to the Committee that we hope to have consideration of the bids sorted out in the very near future and to be able to announce to the nation the outcome of the trade sale process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has made a number of amendments to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992 dealing with the taxation arrangements for offshore banking units or, as they are commonly known, OBUs. These amendments are designed to ensure that deemed interest income can arise only where paid up capital provided by an Australian parent company is used by the subsidiary in the performance of offshore banking activities. Without amendments to the original Bill now proposed, if an OBU subsidiary were engaged in both domestic and offshore banking activities, the deeming provision would have the unintended consequence of resulting in a stream of interest being imputed on the funds used in the domestic part of the business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no objections to these amendments. I would, however, take issue with some of the comments made by Senator McMullan when he moved these amendments on behalf of the Government in the other place. Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are another example of the Government's willingness to swiftly respond to legitimate industry concerns which are brought to its notice so that we can all get on with the job of establishing Australia as a viable offshore banking centre.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be obvious to anyone with a passing familiarity with the history of this legislation that the Government has not been particularly swift or assiduous in responding to industry concerns. Indeed, to a great extent, the Government has ignored these concerns entirely and pressed on regardless of what industry wanted, thereby forcing the industry to accommodate itself to the Government's position. With this in mind, the coalition moved a whole series of amendments to this legislation in the Senate, based for the most part on industry concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government rejected our amendments with virtually no discussion or explanation from Senator McMullan about the merits of those amendments. We should also remember that this offshore banking unit legislation is only one of several measures required to establish Australia as a major regional financial centre and not just a centre for offshore banking activities. A notable example is the legislation required to facilitate further foreign bank entry into Australia, which I spoke to a little while ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from specific measures designed to assist Australia's development as a regional financial centre, we need to pay attention to the full range of tax reform issues if Australian financial services are to be internationally competitive. Tax reform is as crucial to financial services and the financial services industry as it is to the rest of the economy. Clearly, until we have addressed the full range of tax reform issues in this country, we will not be able to fulfil our aspirations to become a regional financial centre, or anything else of note for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling what Mr Geoff Lehmann of Price Waterhouse had to say on this subject. After noting that the Tax Office has for many years argued against Australia trying to compete against Singapore in the taxation of financial services, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the past decade, they (the Tax Office) have done Australia a disservice, by arguing for new tax laws that have given us the world's second most complex tax system after the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">London's international pre-eminence as a financial centre is the result of many factors. But it would not have retained that pre-eminence if Canberra bureaucrats had been running the inland revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>That about says it all. The point here is that the Government is far too complacent and shallow in its approach to these issues. The comments by Senator McMullan that I have referred to here and earlier today typify this complacency and go a long way to explaining why this country is falling behind the pace in so many ways under this Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be laid aside.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposal was the alternative but less preferred option of the PJC report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">?</EMPHASIS> that the PJC would have access to all NCA information that was relevant to the PJC's duties, with the exception of sensitive information. The scheme was set out in the Bill that would allow the PJC to seek the Minister's ruling on whether or not the information sought was in fact sensitive if the NCA refused to provide information on the basis that it came within the definition of sensitive information. The Minister was given the discretion to obtain the non-binding advice of the Inspector-General of the NCA before finally determining the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the Opposition's amendments. The amendments related to the vexed issue of the PJC's access to information following the recommendations of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards</EMPHASIS>?. The key provisions were: new subsection 51(3B) to expressly provide that section 51, the secrecy provision, does not prevent NCA members and members of staff from providing evidence and documents to the PJC and that to do so would not be in breach of the obligation of secrecy. New subsections (3) to (13) of section 55 and some other related consequential amendments provide an alternative scheme to governments in which the NCA is obliged to provide all information sought by the PJC&mdash;limited only by the relevance to the PJC's duties&mdash;subject only to a prohibition on disclosure beyond the PJC if the information is sensitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the chairperson of the NCA claim that the information is sensitive, the PJC may not publish that information beyond the PJC, but the PJC or an individual member of the PJC may seek the Minister's final decision as to whether the information is sensitive and has 14 days to do so. The Minister may obtain the advice of the Inspector-General, but the Minister is not bound to follow it. This is very similar to the Government's scheme, but for the crucial difference that the PJC obtains the sensitive information in the first place. Under both the Government and Opposition model, in theory no sensitive information goes beyond the PJC. That is in theory. The Australian Democrats supported the Opposition's amendments, although the Democrats would have preferred their own model of a Federal Court judge in place of the Minister deciding the matter, with no role for the Inspector-General of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not accept the Opposition or Democrats' line for the following reasons: the NCA is a joint Commonwealth, State, Northern Territory and ACT body that requires the agreement of those governments to continue to exist and operate. Each State and every one of the governments were consulted and agreed to the amendments proposed in the Government's Bill. All the participating State and Territory governments have refused to agree to the Opposition-Democrats amendments. The intergovernmental committee, at its last meeting on 20 November 1992, passed unanimously a resolution that the IGC, firstly, supported the provisions of the Government Bill, which would prevent access by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA to sensitive information and would ensure that disputes as to whether particular information is sensitive are resolvable by inquiry by the Inspector-General of the NCA and determination by the Minister, and, secondly, opposed any amendment to the Bill which would have the effect of granting the Parliamentary Joint Committee unfettered access to NCA sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By a long-standing convention applied in most, if not all, Commonwealth countries and Australian jurisdictions, by law in some, the legislature and Executive are not generally privy to operational details of police and other like bodies, such as the NCA. For example, section 13 of the Australian Federal Police Act vests control of operations of the AFP in the Commissioner and limits the Minister to giving directions as to general policy. Section 58(5) of the National Crime Authority Act precludes the NCA from furnishing to the IGC `any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operations of law enforcement agencies', except where the information is included in the findings of the NCA, and in such cases the NCA is only authorised to report to the Minister or Ministers who gave the reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot agree to the argument that the PJC should have access to information which is generally not available to the intergovernmental committee. Under subsections 59(1), (1A) and (2), the NCA is only obliged to furnish information concerning a specific matter relating to operations under its special or general powers to Ministers within the jurisdiction in which the operations were conducted. There is no general power for the IGC Ministers as a group to obtain such specific information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of information only to the Minister or Ministers within whose jurisdiction operations are undertaken is consistent with the principle of ministerial responsibility. The risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information increases with the number of people who know of that sensitive information. Providing such information to members of the PJC would be a source of increased risk. Access to operational information is not a necessary element for the PJC to evaluate the performance of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not some theoretical concern of the IGC about disclosure of sensitive information. I remind the House that on 17 October 1990 Senator Amanda Vanstone, then a member of the PJC, tabled in the Senate a report of the PJC together with what amounted to a dissenting report that had attached to it evidence that had been given to the PJC in camera. I said then, and I repeat it now: how are we going to have people giving evidence in camera if in fact the next thing it is all over the place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has chosen a path that has led inevitably to the demise of the National Crime Authority Amendment (No. 2) Bill. It is not an option that the Government relishes. There will be no Inspector-General of the NCA, nor indeed will any of those other legislative changes be made, with which the Government was in agreement, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA had recommended in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards?</EMPHASIS>. The Government had in a timely manner considered and agreed to implement many of the recommendations of the PJC report, which is now not to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Opposition that the intergovernmental committee includes a ministerial representative of each State and of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. These jurisdictions are not compelled to participate in this truly cooperative NCA structure. Each and every State could, of its own free will, cut itself from any involvement in the NCA. I would further remind the Opposition that four of the eight State and Territory governments are governed by coalition parties. Yet there is bipartisan support on the IGC for the Government's position in refusing to buckle to the Opposition's unrealistic and ill-considered approach to the provision of sensitive information to the PJC. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has been unwilling, or unable, to impress upon his colleagues in the party room the consequences of the course of action upon which they have embarked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take no pleasure in the action that I have been forced to take. Given the role of the IGC, I believe that the Government had achieved a successful compromise that allowed the PJC to play a significant role in the fight against crime without compromising the operational integrity of the NCA. The IGC has functioned efficiently in its efforts to ensure a national approach to the fight against organised crime. Despite political differences, the IGC has operated in a truly national spirit. Yet, despite the wishes of the States and Territories, the honourable member for Higgins&mdash;perhaps he believes he is the repository of all wisdom and knowledge in this area&mdash;has thwarted those wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention that I understand that not since 1913 has a Minister pulled a Bill in the manner I have chosen. I am compelled to take this unusual course because of the seriousness of the situation that has arisen. The Federal Government, with the advice and consent of the governments of eight Australian States and Territories, passed legislation in this House, the people's House, which was amended by the Senate on the advice of the honourable member for Higgins, a member of this House. I cannot see what the purpose is here. The Senate is prepared to dismiss the wishes of not one but eight State and Territory governments. </PARA>

He comes in here and, with all of the gravitas he can muster, tells us that he is taking this unusual and unprecedented step not to proceed with his own Bill because the Senate has amended it. The fact is that, when two Houses comprise a parliament, we do not always get legislation through in the manner in which we wish. The Attorney may take the view that the Parliament is some kind of accoutrement to legislation that is prepared by him as a Minister or by his public servants and that, if he does not get the legislation he requires, the Parliament is somehow standing in the way of the functioning of government. But the fact is that it is the Parliament that passes legislation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate made an improvement to the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2). He could accept that improvement and allow this Bill to go ahead. I do not think that we ought to be setting aside this Bill as amended by the Senate now. We ought to be adopting the amendments and passing it. Some very good things were proposed in this Bill that we should not walk away from, such as the provision for an Inspector-General. The Government is walking away from it. It is saying that it did not like the ball that came down, so the wickets, the bat, the ball and everything else are just picked up and taken home. There are some good things in this Bill that ought to go through, and some improvements were made in the Senate that ought to be recognised and adopted. To say that the amendments that the Opposition has moved are unusual and somehow unwarranted ignores the whole history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole history of this Bill comes from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The Joint Committee recommended that it have access to information. The amendments that I moved, which were rejected in here but accepted in the Senate, were not just my amendments, just the Liberal Party's amendments, just the coalition's amendments or even just the coalition's and the Democrats' amendments; they were approved by a parliamentary joint committee on which members of the Labor Party sat, chaired by a member of the Labor Party. That Committee&mdash;with Labor, Liberal, National and Democrats representation&mdash;came to this recommendation and recommended a first best option. The Government chose not to accept it. When we put it to the Parliament, it was accepted in the Senate. So the Attorney-General should not try to make out that something unusual has gone on. We have adopted and endorsed a bipartisan recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as the Attorney-General said, that the Inter-governmental Committee looked at this matter. I suppose, on a motion moved by the Attorney, it passed a resolution back on 20 November that it did not want any amendments. Did anyone put the case to the Committee why the amendments were required? Did anybody explain to it the case? Was there anybody in that meeting who was making sure that there were full and frank facts? Anybody can get a resolution out of a committee if it hears only one side. That is not a major turn in relation to this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, let us consider it from the other perspective. Were these recommendations that came forward recommendations of the Inter-governmental Committee? Did it start this? Was it that Committee that was concerned about the accountability of the National Crime Authority? No, it was the Parliamentary Joint Committee. It thought that there had to be greater accountability. It proposed a model. It was bipartisan. It has been adopted by the Senate. It went off to the IGC, which was never involved in this&mdash;it did not see the necessity for that in the first place, it did not do a report, it did not make the recommendations&mdash;and the Government decided against the proposal. It may have had some greater moral suasion if the IGC had shown a great interest and come forward with the proposal, but it did not; it was the Parliamentary Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government went on to say, `Well, the IGC does not have this kind of information; therefore the Parliamentary Joint Committee cannot. I would have thought entirely the reverse. If the IGC is not interested and is not exercising that kind of supervision, is it not therefore a stronger case that a parliamentary joint committee, a committee of this House, should do that? Rather than to say that one committee has chosen, as it were, not to seek this kind of information and that therefore nobody should, should not one say, `Well, there is a committee. It is a parliamentary committee, it is interested, it does have a statutory role and it will exercise that role of accountability.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not put this in too precious a sense. A parliamentary joint committee is a committee of parliamentarians, elected by the people of Australia. They are the people that the people of Australia entrust to pass legislation. Yet they are not entitled to have information in relation to an agency that they are able to set up; is that the proposition? They are able to set it up and fund it, but they are not allowed to know what is going on. What an absurd proposition! If we are to have a parliamentary committee and give it accountability and a role, it has to be entitled to the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to what I believe is the real problem. The real problem with the model that was put forward by the Government is this definition of sensitive information. I said this in my speech during the second reading debate. What the Government was trying to keep from the Parliamentary Joint Committee was sensitive information which, as defined, might prejudice the reputation of a person. So it would be conceivably open to the NCA to say, `Look, we cannot give you that information; that would disclose that we have been doing something we should not have. That would prejudice the reputation of one of our commissioners, or our chairman, or one of our officers. That would prejudice that person's reputation. You cannot have that kind of information'. That is the very kind of information that the Parliamentary Joint Committee should be interested in. It is not a mere academic point. This point has come up in relation to the NCA. The Attorney-General would be aware, and the public is aware, that there was a very strange incident in relation to a previous Chairman of the NCA. That might be a matter that was within the province of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem that I have with the Government's proposition is that, by enacting its proposition, the Parliament would effectively be saying, `We do not trust ourselves with information'. How can a parliament ever say, `We cannot trust ourself with information.'? As we have reiterated time and again, there is a difference between access to information and disclosure. What we have said is that, if responsible parliamentarians who are charged with the legislative responsibility of ensuring accountability of a body believe that they need particular information, they should be entitled to have it. But that does not mean they can broadcast it to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General described in his speech, there were very precise mechanisms ultimately which gave the discretion to the Minister or to the Inspector-General that provided that such material, sensitive information as defined, would not be disclosed&mdash;that is, disclosed to the world or the Parliament or put out. But there is an enormous difference between having access and disclosure. It is a difference that the Parliamentary Joint Committee was able to understand and take into account in its recommendations. It is a difference that the Senate was able to understand and take into account in moving its amendments. It is a responsible difference that I believe this House ought to be able to understand. I believe it is a matter of deep regret that, because the Attorney does not understand or accept that proposition, all of the good reforms and changes that were provided in this Bill will now lapse and this proposal will have to be taken up&mdash;and it will be taken up&mdash;and fixed by the next government. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill represents a further step towards the rationalisation of the institutional arrangements for the coal mining industry. The Bill provides for amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in order to transfer the function of providing administrative support for the Coal Industry Tribunal from the Joint Coal Board to the Australian Industrial Registry. The Bill also amends the audit provisions of the Coal Industry Act 1946 to bring the audit arrangements for the Joint Coal Board into line with current practice. The New South Wales Government has made the necessary complementary amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments concerning administrative support for the Tribunal are concerned solely with that subject and do not in any way alter the Tribunal's industrial relations powers and functions. Some coalmining industry parties have advocated changes to those powers and functions. It has become apparent in the course of discussions that the responsible Minister, Senator Cook, has already held with the parties that there is a range of strongly held and widely divergent views about that. Any change to the Tribunal's powers and functions will only be made after full consultation and discussion with all parties. This process of consultation has commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the Coal Industry Act 1946 establishes that the Joint Coal Board is responsible for providing administrative assistance to the Tribunal. The Board employs the staff who provide that assistance. The Tribunal is funded, through the Joint Coal Board, on a 50-50 basis by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments. Recent amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 of the Commonwealth and the Coal Industry Act 1946 of New South Wales have redefined the role of the Board by providing that it will in future focus on workers compensation and miners health and welfare, and that it will become self-financing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inconsistent with this redefined role that the Board should continue to provide administrative support for the CIT. This Bill amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Coal Industry Act 1946 so that the Australian Industrial Registry will be responsible for providing administrative support for the Tribunal. This will include the provision of administrative staff. </PARA>

<PARA>The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 establishes the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme. This scheme provides a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals which, among other things, aids in the protection of the Australian people and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the scheme was introduced in 1990, the Government decided that the regulatory impact on industry would be reviewed after two years of operation. This review has now been completed. The recommendations arising from this review have led to the amendments proposed in the Bill which will remove impediments to product innovation within the chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are a further indication of the commitment of the Government to ensuring a workable and effective scheme. It meets the objectives of protecting the Australian people and the environment, while reducing the regulatory burden on industry. The Bill allows for the introduction of three new notification categories: `eligible' chemicals, low volume chemicals, and synthetic polymers of low concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amnesty period will be introduced for eligible chemicals to assist industry to comply with the Act. While companies have had the opportunity of nominating chemicals to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances from 1 January 1977 to 16 July 1990, some companies have neglected to nominate some chemicals. As the legislation currently stands, such companies would be in technical breach of the Act and liable to severe penalties. During the amnesty period such penalties will be waived but, as a safeguard, companies will be required to submit some basic information about each chemical. The director will have the power to refuse the application if the chemical presents a significant hazard to human health or the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a two-year amnesty period. The Government considers that this period, which will commence on the date the Bill comes into effect, will be sufficient for companies to come forward, especially when coupled with the planned intensive promotional campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For low volume chemicals, that is chemicals which it is proposed be introduced in quantities of up to 100 kilograms per year, the notification and assessment requirements will be reduced. The 100-kilogram limit will be an Australia-wide total and not a limit per applicant. Adequate safeguards will be in place to ensure the integrity of the scheme is not compromised. A list of chemicals accepted under this category will be published at least on an annual basis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chemical Gazette.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, companies were required to supply a full data package and a full application fee for these chemicals. Under these new arrangements both the data requirements and the application fee will be significantly reduced. The 100-kilogram threshold will be reviewed after two years. This review will also examine the possibility of a lower threshold where no assessment will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes these arrangements will be particularly beneficial to innovation in the chemical industry. This initiative is in line with overseas schemes which also have arrangements for low volume chemicals and demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that our scheme is in harmony with comparable schemes administered by our overseas trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Polymers of low concern are a class of chemicals which inherently pose little risk to human health or the environment. For polymers which meet prescribed criteria the Bill proposes that the notification and assessment requirements be streamlined. Companies will be required to supply the relevant information on a form and will not be required to submit raw data. For these chemicals, a copy of the full public report will be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chemical Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes being proposed in relation to this category, therefore, further demonstrate a commitment to streamline procedures. In order to make the decision making process for all the new categories introduced by these amendments as transparent and easily understood as possible, guidelines will be developed in consultation with government agencies, unions and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal Act will also be amended to require that all assessment reports include a material safety data sheet. The MSDS is an important vehicle for communicating safety and handling information to supervisors and workers. This amendment will ensure greater availability of the MSDS in the workplace and will assist the States and Territories in the operation of their occupational health and safety legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill includes a new provision which will enable the Commonwealth Government to make regulations to prohibit or restrict the introduction and export of chemicals that are the subject of prescribed international agreements. Such power is fundamental to meeting international obligations with respect to certain chemicals and follows significant advances internationally, especially within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nations environment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Prior informed consent' is one international scheme to which the provisions of the amendment could be applied. This scheme is based upon the principle that the export of a chemical which is banned, severely restricted or withdrawn from use in order to protect human health or the environment should not proceed without the consent of the importing country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends, in circumstances where a chemical is to be banned or severely restricted, that thorough consultations occur with relevant government agencies and industry prior to a regulation being made. Administrative arrangements for international coordination on these chemicals will be developed in collaboration with relevant authorities. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is the designated national authority for `prior informed consent' and will consult at an international level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill also contains some minor amendments of the principal Act to simplify and to remove redundant sections. The passage of the Bill will show the strength of the Government's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on industry, while maintaining adequate safeguards for the Australian community and the environment. The Government is determined to create a regulatory climate which will foster industry development and thereby assist in achieving the Government's micro-economic reform objectives. The Bill will also ensure that assessment effort is consistent with the level of risk posed by chemicals and will result in the redirection of assessment effort to more needed areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worksafe Australia has been instrumental in assessing the needs of the chemical industry and formulating these changes after extensive rounds of consultation with all the stakeholders. It has consulted with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies. Industry bodies consulted were the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chemical Confederation of Australia, the Australian Chemical Industry Council and their affiliates. Discussion with other industry bodies not affiliated with these peak organisations has also taken place. In addition, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and interested non-government organisations were included in the consultation process. There is therefore widespread support for these amendments. I commend the Bill to the House and, on behalf of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

I concur with the honourable member for Bennelong that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Bob Brown), who is at the table, has very comprehensively covered this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the industrial chemical industry in this country. We need to have the best safeguards in standards and requirements. Chemicals are a necessary part of industry and development. I guess that is brought home to me, more than most other people. I am very pleased to be able to say that I have a growing chemical industry in my electorate, particularly in the city of Gladstone, where both ICI and Minproc Chemical Co. Pty Ltd have established chemical industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago, the Brisbane City Council, under the former Lord Mayor, Sallyanne Atkinson, made it clear that the people of Brisbane did not want ICI establishing a sodium cyanide plant at Lytton. Mayor Col Brown of Gladstone and I invited ICI to come to Gladstone to see what facilities we had to develop sensibly, in a sound environment, a chemical industry. Through the State Department of Industrial Development, we now have 1,500 hectares. The Yarwun industrial estate is set aside on 50-hectare lots. The Minister for Land Transport has on two occasions inspected that industrial development and the potential land that can be used for safely developing industries such as the chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now history that ICI came to Gladstone, met with the Gladstone task force, the Gladstone councils and the port authority and established a sodium cyanide plant in Gladstone. ICI is now in the final construction stages of an ammonium nitrate plant, which will add value to that chemical industry and ICI's plant, and quite a number of permanent jobs have been created as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again ICI, in conjunction with the trade union movement, has been a pathfinder in setting up an industrial agreement, a greenfields agreement, that has been ratified by the ACTU. ICI can be complimented for being the pacesetter. Something like 1,000 industrial agreements have now been ratified by the ACTU, the Commission and employers in this country.

I compliment the Minister at the table for supporting me and David Hamill, who is the State Minister for Transport, for putting in the extension of the railway line, which now allows sodium cyanide to be carried by rail. This is a much safer mode of transport. Instead of using road transport, we are utilising rail facilities; we are interfacing road and rail. I am on the record as saying that I would like to see that extension go down to Queensland Cement and Lime eventually, so that we can utilise the clinker plant and the facilities that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Minister for supporting that expansion and adding infrastructure that then benefits the industrial development of cities such as Gladstone. Bob Hindley is the manager of the plant, and he does a great job. Ross McCann, who was involved in the construction stage of ICI, is a personal friend and should be complimented for the amount of work that he put in, in setting up the ICI chemical plant in Gladstone. I hope that over time we see more expansion of and value added to those plants and facilities. Once we have one chemical plant, it adds value. The by-products and so on are added value too, and other plants come as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A company called Minproc is also established in Gladstone, and it produces sodium cyanide. I compliment that company. Russ Connor, Tom Hunter and Martin Ackland, who were involved at the establishment of that chemical plant, have been able to create jobs for our district as well as produce import replacement goods, which I think is vital. Minproc's sodium cyanide is now replacing imported products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have witnessed tough competition between the domestic products from ICI and Minproc and imported products from companies such as Dupont. Anti-dumping applications have been lodged, and the cases against some companies, but not all, have been successful. It is important to recognise that Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority do a great job. They are able to indicate when companies do the wrong thing and dump into Australia, and also highlight when it is simply tough competition. That is the way it ought to be. Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority are GATT related, and it is through those processes that we get sensible trade in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment both companies, ICI and Minproc, for the contributions that they are making to central Queensland&mdash;particularly Gladstone&mdash;by providing job opportunities. The industrial chemical industry is of great importance to Australia. I know that the Deputy Speaker is fully aware of the importance of chemicals in agriculture. Good, safe chemicals used properly can increase our productivity and our quality of product. Once the emotion is taken out of the subject, chemicals used sensibly are a necessary tool in both primary and secondary industry. Amendments such as the one we are speaking on not only go a long way towards providing the safeguards that are necessary and giving confidence to the community but also, importantly, give confidence to the industries that produce these necessary products such as industrial chemicals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has believed that there is a role for government in inducing a recovery in this country and lowering the level of unemployment. You have said that there is no role for government; you have said that government should withdraw. You have said that we should cut $7 billion out of the Budget. You have said that we should have a contractionary policy. In fact, in a question to me on 24 November, the Leader of the Opposition said that I had:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sought to argue a case for stimulatory economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore ask the Prime Minister: given that the 1991-92 Budget was stimulatory, given that the One Nation statement was stimulatory, and given that the 1992-93 Budget was stimulatory . . . Surely stimulatory economic policies do not work and an alternative approach is called for.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition said that. In other words, he referred to the policies of engagement of the economy, of adding to public infrastructure, of adding to public spending, which are now turning around our national accounts. A week ago we saw that two-thirds of the growth was coming from the public sector, from public demand. Your Leader told me how wrong-headed stimulatory policy was, and urged upon us, in the throwaway speech he made after the Budget, that we should cut 2 per cent of GDP out of the deficit, that we should cut it back by $7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week I see that all the newspapers are carrying this statement: `We have got to kick start the economy', says Hewson, `We have got to take on stimulatory policies'. He says that he is now listening. About all he is listening to is Andrew Robb and his pollster; that is all he is listening to. I guarantee, Mr Speaker, that in one press statement he had the word `listening' 23 times. He is listening everywhere&mdash;cooee! cooee!&mdash;hearing voices. We know whose voices they are. They are his pollster's voice and his Federal Director's voice. They are the voices he is listening to. He is now basically saying that he thinks he can deliver the Government's policies better. He is saying, `The stimulatory policies of the Government can be delivered better by us'. He is into camouflage politics.</PARA>

You are saying, `Look, we believe now in stimulatory policies; we believe in putting our arm out to help people; we believe in giving people a fair go'. People are saying, `Sure you do, sure you do'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that, if the Leader of the Opposition has to move to the Government's policies, I say to the Australian public: let the party that believes in those policies put them in and keep them in action; do not take some shabby alternative that does not believe in them, that wants to pick up lines from the Government about stimulatory policies, about caring, about listening to people, when it is prepared to throw people off unemployment benefits after nine months; when the shadow spokesman for social security calls the unemployed riffraff; and when the honourable member for Mayo talks about leaning out a caring arm when there has been no care or compassion in him over the last year since the presentation of Fightback.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be changing its mind on this issue. There is a very simple explanation, and that is that a goods and services tax is inherently unfair. That, of course, is the point of this debate at the moment. The honourable member asks, `Can you make it more fair by excluding certain items from it, particularly food?'. I refer to a remark that was made just a couple of months ago by the Leader of the Opposition. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that food should not be taxed simply does not stand up.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives three arguments, and then he gives a fourth. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excluding food would mean raising the GST on all other products in order to maintain the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>Here you have it: the GST is inherently unfair and, then, if you exclude some of it, you have to load up the rest of it. Of course, the rest of it that you would load up presumably would be that relating to services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has an intriguing argument in relation to the taxation of services. It says that services are consumed&mdash;and this is in Fightback mark 1; God knows what will be in Fightback mark 2, but it will be just as erroneous&mdash;disproportionately by the well off. So here we have the rich drinking more water than the poor. Is that what happens? So you tax the water, and this is somehow fair, because you are taxing the rich more than you are taxing the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is obviously rubbish. It is true wherever you look in the area of services. Who is it that goes on public transport and will be taxed as a result of the imposition of the GST on bus fares? Who is it? Is it the wealthy who are jumping on the bus in order to go from A to B? Is it the wealthy who are taking their shoes along to have them resoled or repaired and being taxed for the privilege?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it the case that the rich pay more for having their rubbish collected than do the poor, when they are living side by side in the same municipality? This is so obviously wrong, that services are consumed disproportionately by the well off, as the Leader of the Opposition says. But no doubt we will have some fantastic explanation provided for us on Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the policy gymnastics of the Leader of the Opposition know no bounds. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, here we had him clutching this policy for a year&mdash;a year in gestation, a year being clutched to his breast, a year being forced down the neck of anyone who would be prepared to listen to him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that commitment, the matching funding that this Government recommitted itself to in the recent Budget has seen our contribution to rural research and development increase by 8 per cent this year. Coupled with the research and development corporations, we have seen a trebling of rural research and development since 1985. That is not to mention the commitments that are there in terms of CSIRO and the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reflects the recognition on this side of the House of the importance of research and development and innovation as a building block for sustainable agriculture, but more value added agriculture.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point to the House that, under us, the commitment to rural research and development is secure. Where it is not secure is under Fightback. Under Fightback there is not one commitment made to the continuation of rural research and development. Fightback is silent in this area, just as the coalition parties in Victoria and Tasmania were silent on this issue before they went to the polls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did they do when they got to power? Tasmania cut the rural research and development budget by $2.5m. Some 45 research positions went; they were cut away. There was no mention of it before the election. In relation to Victoria, the Agriculture Department's budget has been cut by $6.2m; some 200 jobs have gone, many of them in the area of research. That is significantly more than the across-the-board 2 per cent cut previously indicated. No wonder they were silent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time I got up in the House on this point, the Deputy Leader of the National Party said that it was not true that Victoria was going to cut rural research and development. Well, it has done so, and it has done so in massive swathes. Not only is Fightback silent; we also cannot trust the coalition in office. It will not tell us the full extent of its programs. As the examples of Victoria and Tasmania have demonstrated, it will cut in the areas that are needed most.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the position of the long term unemployed. There are various leaks in the press, of course&mdash;most of them inspired by the Leader of the Opposition who, despite trying to maintain a cheerful demeanour in the public forum, has sat here with a face like thunder staring at the desk for the entirety of this Question Time, with no animation at all. Despite what he has had to say about the fact that he is reconsidering the Opposition's totally heartless policy of tossing people off unemployment benefits after nine months, he has not told us what they are going to do for long term unemployed people; what they are going to reverse in the rest of the policies which are central to their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fact needs to be understood and put firmly in the public's mind: some 61 per cent of labour programs now go to long term unemployed people. They are a saving in Fightback and a saving in the reduction of $7 billion that honourable members opposite have been talking about in their opposition to the Budget that we have put forward. That is what gives people who have been out of work for 12 months a chance to work again; not simply paying them&mdash;that is important, but it is not sufficient. It gives them a chance to work again. Likewise, of the 119,000  people that the CES placed in the September quarter, some 27 per cent had been out of work for a year or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand these things about Opposition policy: firstly, Opposition members stand for the abolition of the CES and the palming out into sectors of private employment&mdash;which have never had to handle massive labour market programs, although most of them cease to exist, so that is not quite the problem it would be if you were actually dealing with our programs&mdash;plus any placement opportunities that people obtain in industry. What that means, of course, is that, with the abolition of those functions of the CES, they will get absolutely nowhere. The long term unemployed will not be given those opportunities to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of the GST itself, which Dr Murphy, their modeller, has estimated would add between 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent to the unemployment rate by its second year of operation. That is some 50,000 people. We are not talking about unemployment in greengrocer shops; we are talking about unemployment in the area where there has been the greatest job creation over the last few years, and that is in small business. Basically, small businesses are service providers. That is where employment generation has been&mdash;not people paying payroll tax, not people providing the community with food; but people providing the community with their services. As far as anything that has leaked so far from the Opposition's intentions is concerned, there is no intention to deal with the problems that they pose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of the policy of the Reserve Bank. Is it to be assumed that, as the Reserve Bank has been given a charter which has its unemployment objectives removed from it, you are going to get the stimulatory policies which will deal with the question of the long term unemployed?</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3840" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has announced today that an agreement has been concluded for the Chargeurs company, one of the world's major wool processors, to produce superfine wool tops at its Wagga plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of a major expansion of the Chargeurs wool tops plant at Wagga Wagga is greatly encouraging news for the Riverina region of New South Wales and for the wool industry in general. Processing adds about 35 per cent to the value of wool, and this will be the first plant in Australia to process superfine wool tops. Downstream value adding is, of course, vital to the development of the nation as a trading nation, but it is particularly vital to the primary industries of this country and to rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the Chargeurs plant will mean $62m in new capital expenditure, an extra $120m a year in export earnings for Australia, 90 more jobs at the plant itself, 50 jobs in the building of it, and a boost of $340m to the economy of New South Wales. We are very pleased that the board of Chargeurs has chosen the Riverina as the place for its development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that this expansion would not have gone ahead without the TCFDA&mdash;the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority&mdash;contributing in a material way to its success with funding. Along with most honourable members, I am sure it is very clear to the House that the Liberal Party voted against support coming through the TCFDA to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. In fact, the honourable member for Curtin and the honourable member for Maranoa made cynical, dog in the manger speeches against the TCFDA funding when it was introduced in the House. Of course, the honourable member for Hume was sidelined or not supported by the Leader of the Opposition because of a challenge from the National Party in the seat of Hume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen again, as always, that it takes a Labor government to represent rural Australia. Only the efforts of this Government&mdash;and I might mention the efforts of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, my Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and the efforts of the New South Wales Government have produced a benefit for workers and the wool producers of the Riverina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a copy of a letter here from the Managing Director of Chargeurs, Mr Giraud, in which he describes as essential the assistance available from the TCFDA and the Australian Development Assistance Agency. This is another example of the role government can play in making Australia better, in inducing new industries, in making Australia more relevant in the world, in adding value, in doing the things which the National Party and the Liberal Party were never able to do. The Leader of the Opposition had his Party oppose in the Parliament funding for this particular plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This again makes the point that it is now the Liberal Party which is trying to change its spots. It is saying, `We believe at the eleventh hour that there is a role for government. We believe there is a role for us in stimulating the economy. Just disregard all that rhetoric we have been putting to you all year about how Fightback is the answer'. It was saying, `You ought to be contracting fiscal policy. Stop trying to buy employment. Stop trying to help industries. That is the compassion that suffocates people. There is no role for government. Government, get out of the way'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another example where government has produced, as we saw BWK at Geelong, another state of the art, tops, making plant. Now with Chargeurs at Wagga, we are seeing the renaissance of the Australian wool industry in terms of added value and higher levels of production, delivered by a Labor government with policies of inclusion, with policies of a role for government, with policies of government getting involved and Australians moving together, not creating an underclass, not leaving people behind and not saying, `If you try to bring them up you will drag the rest of us down'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision is right on the beam for the policies that provide the best things to Australia. We can see innovation, change, added value and employment in one of the provincial centres of Australia, and it is delivered, as always, with the wit, inventiveness and good spiritedness of a Labor government.</PARA>

I have been informed that, if a by-election is not held, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) will endeavour to maintain the services of the Wills electorate office until the general election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table a private member's Bill, which abolishes compulsory retirement in the public sector, to allow for comment and for suggestions from interested parties while the Bill is before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has two objectives: firstly, to allow the recruitment of officers after the age of 65; and, secondly, to allow people to work beyond retirement age. That age alone should not be a bar to employment has been a key policy of the Opposition since 1988 and is an important component in our Fightback plan as it will help to change community attitudes towards older workers and overcome the age stereotypes which have actively discriminated against older workers for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill therefore addresses two issues. Firstly, middle aged people are finding it increasingly difficult to get work after being retrenched because of public perceptions that after 45 people are too old. A study by V. Maxwell of Monash University has found that this is due to an attitude among employers that older workers are inflexible, complacent, have more health problems and are unwilling to retrain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Middle-aged people make up the majority of the long term unemployed. The national average duration of unemployment for men aged between 35 and 54 years is 63.7 weeks. Out of every 10 jobs, only three go to people who have been unemployed for over 12 months. The current high level of redundancies also guarantees that this trend will continue unless there is a fundamental change in national policy, as proposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the growing trend to early retirement in Australia. Indeed, some companies in the process of restructuring are influencing staff to retire as early as age 50. The national interest makes it essential that our mature and skilled work force be productively employed for as long as possible. Thus, it is essential that governments lead the way in giving older people a fairer go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a role for government in establishing the retirement parameters of its own public service and setting an example for the private sector. The purpose of this legislation is therefore to give the community at large the opportunity to comment on the Bill, and act as a further encouragement to State governments which have not yet gone in this direction&mdash;notably, at this stage, Victoria and Tasmania&mdash;as well as the private sector across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only report the Government has had. It also sent people to New Zealand to look at industrial relations. I will tell the Treasurer how I know about that. When 10 of us were in New Zealand during the year we met a number of people who had spoken to the very Treasury people that he had sent to New Zealand. I know what they were told. They were told that the industrial relations reforms in New Zealand have been a great success and that the average working person has had a very good deal. The vast majority&mdash;about 90 per cent&mdash;have got either the same wage or an increase in wage and, of those, half have had an increase above the rate of inflation. For all the Government's silly scare campaigns, the truth is that in New Zealand people are actually better off. Government members do not have the guts to stand up and state the truth about what is happening in New Zealand, let alone what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say by way of passing reference that it is hard to suppress the truth on a permanent basis. The Treasury Secretary has been told that he is not to say in public that he supports the GST, but we all know that he does. We have to give him this much&mdash;at least he goes around saying it privately. The other day someone who was in one of his private meetings actually told somebody writing for the newspaper what he had been saying about how good the GST was. The article is headed, `Treasury blow to PM', because Treasury, of course, thinks it is a great idea as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask a very simple question: where is this Government's economic credibility? Does it lie in the worst recession for 60 years? Does it lie in the One Nation statement that he proudly proclaimed last February, which is now shown to be a complete sham, an absolute shambles and, in fact, a living lie? Or does it lie in the smart one-liners we get from people such as the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister actually had a meeting of his troops in the alcove before Question Time to rev them up to disrupt Question Time. He is that desperate and worried about his own circumstances. It is the typical sort of trickery that we have from this person. Or does his credibility lie in the fact that unemployment is now at 11.4 per cent? The answer is very simple, and that is that these people do not have a credible economic leg to stand on. I think most Australians now appreciate that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Government's record in terms of its statements to the public. I pulled out the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the debate on the economic situation at this time last year.

That is the magical figure. Members of the Government themselves have said, `If we cannot get 3 or 4 per cent growth, then our unemployment situation is actually going to get worse'. Instead of things being better next year, on the Government's calculations, if we do not get to 3 or 4 per cent growth&mdash;I say 4 per cent because the Prime Minister said in Question Time today that it is Labor's plan to get us up to this 4 per cent&mdash;the two plus two conclusion is that unemployment will actually get worse. </PARA>

The latest national account figures tell us how big the cake is and whether it is growing or not. If we take into account the size of the population, in the last year we have had 0.2 per cent GDP growth per capita. Basically the place is as flat a landscape as we can get in terms of growth. If we look at the ANZ job ads figures, we see that the figure for November was 0.6 per cent. That basically is as flat as a tack. If we look at the graph, we see nothing there.

If we are to get out of the recession, people have to start investing. It is pretty simple. People have to start building up their businesses to create jobs, to get production going, to start to lift our living standards. In the last figure, private gross fixed capital expenditure fell by 2.1 per cent. We are going backwards on that number. If we look at our other big problem in Australia, and that is the fact that we have this huge debt to the rest of the world, on the latest national quarterly accounts, that is, for a three-month period, our exports fell by 1.1 per cent and our imports went up by 2.4 per cent. </PARA>

But if blame is to be allocated on the failure to sell, then apart from John Hewson, the next to shoulder the blame for the failure to sell should be the Shadow Treasurer, and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Peter Reith. Should Dr Hewson win the election, he must surely have grave doubts about the capacity of Peter Reith to fill the Treasurer's role, if for no other reason than Mr. Reith's political credibility has been so tarnished.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it has been so tarnished, because only a little while ago this year he said to Laurie Oakes, `We are not budging an inch, Laurie, on this proposal, or the other proposals contained in Fightback'. He has been running around Australia&mdash;programmed, wound up and sent in a particular direction like some deranged automaton&mdash;telling the people of Australia what he has been told to say. He never thinks about it&mdash;he does not understand it too well&mdash;he just spouts what he has been told to say. Now he finds himself in this terrible position of having to relearn it all, to be recast and to be relaunched in order that he can now start spouting whatever is the new Opposition line which emerges on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a cheek for the Deputy Leader to come in here and talk about growth when the Opposition has a policy&mdash;to the extent that it has a policy&mdash;about contraction. Opposition members stood up here after the Budget was delivered and said that it was reckless because it was too stimulatory. What was their solution? Their solution was to rip about $7 billion out of the Federal Budget. That was what the Opposition Leader said a couple of nights after the Budget was brought down. He said, `We would reduce the size of the Commonwealth Budget by $6 billion to $7 billion'. As if that would not have an effect on growth. As if that would not have an effect on unemployment. Even a cautious assumption about what would happen to unemployment as a result of that is that we would see an additional 120,000 or 130,000 people unemployed. Not only does he not understand this policy; he does not understand its implications for this issue which he raises today in his MPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is true that we would like to see the economy growing faster than it is at the moment, but the question is how we do that and what policies will ensure that the economy grows faster. All the Opposition has been able to talk about in this monomania which it has developed over the last year is taxation, as if some big tax shift will make a jot of difference to employment in Australia. Of course it will not. Opposition members have come to that realisation now only because they have failed to convince the people of Australia. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said, it is not because they have changed their minds. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to the extent that he has a view on these things, has not changed that view; he has realised that that view will not wash and, therefore, he has to go through the cosmetic exercise of changing the policy even though Opposition members will not believe in the new policy which they will bring down on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine what is happening to Australia in the context of the rest of the world. It is impossible to imagine that the economy of a country such as Australia, particularly as a major commodity provider to the developed world&mdash;especially to Japan but also to other countries in the developed world&mdash;and a major exporter of agricultural and mineral commodities, can be considered in isolation from the rest of the world. What we said, and will continue to say, is that Australia is in a more privileged position than many other developed countries because we have developed our trading links with some of the more rapidly growing countries, particularly in the Asian area&mdash;northern Asia, north-eastern Asia and South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a huge shift in the way in which Australia trades with the rest of the world, which has meant that we are to some extent cushioned from what is happening in other parts of the developed world in North America and Europe. It is for that reason that some of the economic forecasts, particularly the one produced on 1 December by London based Consensus Economics, say that, of the major OECD countries, the forecast for Australian growth is higher than that for any other major developed country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecast for Australia in 1993 is 3.5 per cent. That is not our forecast; it is not a forecast to which we give any more prominence than any other. This is what this organisation says about Australia's growth. It forecasts 2 per cent for Belgium, 3.1 per cent for Canada, 1.6 per cent for France, 0.3 per cent for Germany, 0.9 per cent for Italy, 2.3 per cent for Japan, 1.5 per cent for the Netherlands, 1.1 per cent for Spain, minus 0.2 per cent for Sweden, one per cent for the United Kingdom, 2.7 per cent for the United States, 2.8 per cent for North America, just one per cent for Europe and 3.5 per cent for Australia, which is much closer to the Asia-Pacific OECD countries. What we are seeing, in the face of this criticism from the Opposition, is that Australia is forecast by this organisation to do better than any of the other major developed countries&mdash;that is, the major members of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would honourable members not think that was a matter for some pride? Would they not imagine that that was something about which the Opposition would say, `Okay, perhaps things are not going as well as we would like to see them, or the Government would like to see them, but at least we are doing better than most.'? Indeed, according to these forecasters, we will do better than any of the major developed countries with which we compare ourselves. But there is not a bit of it. All we have is this carping, haranguing style of Opposition members as they look for various pieces of bad news. They have become experts on identifying bits of bad news. They have a total aversion to finding anything which might be remotely positive about Australia's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The papers tomorrow will publish the OECD's economic outlook No. 52, which is the OECD's assessment of what is happening to the world and to the member countries of the OECD. Again we will find an estimate of Australia's growth rate for 1993, which as I said in Question Time is around 3 per cent. It will grow more rapidly in 1994. In that context, we will find ourselves behind only one of the major OECD countries. I would have thought that if the Opposition were really concerned about this country it would have been prepared to talk up that issue rather than to continue its relentless efforts to talk down the Australian economy. Some other goods news came out overnight in relation to the performance of 700 Australian manufacturing companies. </PARA>

Surely even the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) would think that that was a pretty good prospect for any firm. Surely even he is prepared to acknowledge that to have this as the prospect for 700 firms, lifting Australian exports of manufactured goods by $8 billion, is something for us as Australians to be very proud of. The AMC study suggests that in 20 years it is possible that these firms and others like them could be exporting $70 billion worth of products each year. This is an amazing transformation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that this amount is coming from a large number of smallish firms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pork-barrelling at its worst. The second point that the Treasurer tried to make was that somehow or other it was an outrage for the coalition to update Fightback. Let us remember what happened 12 months ago when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) became Prime Minister and said that there was going to be at least 4 per cent growth. On the Prime Minister's own words, there has to be 4 per cent growth if unemployment is to stabilise and start to fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the One Nation statement earlier this year. Does anybody still hear about One Nation?  The growth forecast is still 4 per cent but the Budget sank like a stone, even after throwing in $800m to try to create those jobs. One Nation was derailed with the failure to spend some of the money. In the Budget we are down to 3 per cent growth. What is next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of this matter of public importance is that it is time that the Treasurer released Treasury's latest revised estimates of economic growth. How much lower than 3 per cent is the figure now, which was Treasury's changed figure in the Budget?  The release of these estimates is made more imperative because this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resource Quarterly, </EMPHASIS>released a few days ago by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&mdash;one of the officially recognised forecasters&mdash;has indicated that Australia's growth for this financial year will be 2 1/2 per cent. That forecast is closer to home and shoots down all of the rosy and inaccurate international forecasts that the Treasurer has been trotting out.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that even the Government's Budget forecast is not real. It means that unemployment must increase. It means that the Budget deficit must increase. What is the Government's response?  That is what this matter of public importance is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at those ABARE forecasts we see that the figure of 2 1/2 per cent is still too high, because on the annualised growth rate in the last 12 months we are down to 2.1 per cent. As I will indicate later, the Business Council of Australia and other employers have indicated the job shedding that will continue in the new year. The Government should not take any sort of comfort from ABARE's long term forecasts&mdash;even though that December edition states that in the next financial year growth will be 4 per cent and in the following year 4 1/2 per cent&mdash;because ABARE's track record on long term forecasting is pretty poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in December 1990, ABARE predicted that for 1990-91 there would be a 0.5 per cent increase in growth, whereas the actual was minus 0.5 and so it was one per cent too optimistic. ABARE also predicted that for 1991-92 there would be 3 1/2 per cent growth when the real growth is 0.2 per cent, so it was over 3 per cent too optimistic there. In its December 1991 forecast, ABARE predicted that for 1991-92, the current year then, there would be a 1.5 per cent growth whereas the actual growth was only 0.2 per cent. Again, the prediction was well over and ABARE was too optimistic. For this year the growth was going to be 4 per cent but we are now down to 2.5 per cent. There is no comfort for the Government in any of the longer term projections of ABARE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia has just released a report which indicated that, of 43 out of the 82 largest companies, and therefore the largest employers&mdash;this is significant&mdash;24 said that they would be cutting their employment by 5 per cent in the new year. On those figures, there will be a 2 per cent overall reduction in employment. That is a terrible situation facing this country in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures says that 8,000 jobs will be lost in small and medium manufacturing in the new year. When it comes to rural Australia, ABARE indicates that this year the net value of farm production will be up to $1.8 billion from $1.2 billion last year. However, in the 1980s the average net farm income was $4 billion. That is a terrible reduction in farm income. We can go on and look at the average over three years where broad acre farming will have an accumulated loss of minus $57,848, the worst being the sheep farmers who are over $100,000 in the red over three years. That is why rural debt has increased from under $10,000m to over $14,000m in that same time. </PARA>

But what is even more significant is ABARE's medium term projection for the future to 1998, where it says that the range of net farm income will be between $1.7 billion and $2 billion. This means that, 10 years after average net farm income was $4 billion, it will be under half of that amount over the next few years. If anybody in this country needs Fightback it is the rural sector because, according to Treasury the cost savings alone under Fightback will be $1 billion a year, or basically 50 per cent additional net farm income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to unemployment. The Department of Employment, Education and Training produced some very interesting figures on unemployment in its June quarter report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small area labour markets</EMPHASIS>, which was released in late August. For example, for the June quarter unemployment in the Prime Minister's electorate was 13.5 per cent; in the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) it was 18.9 per cent; 14.8 per cent in the Treasurer's electorate; and in the electorate of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), 16.3 per cent. Of course, all of those rates have got worse since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is really curious is that the September quarter figures should have been released late last month. They would have showed a further deterioration in the employment rate of these electorates. We have been told that we are not likely to see the figures before Christmas. Here is another series of figures that the Government is hiding from the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go further. In regional Australia youth unemployment was a staggering 32.4 per cent for the June quarter&mdash;and that is before the school leavers are taken into account. Australia already has the worst record&mdash;and has had for the last two years&mdash;of the 10 leading Western economies on job losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the sad anniversary of the Prime Minister's accession to the Prime Ministership of this country. Upon his accession he made some pledges. He said that he would deal honestly with the people of Australia. That is a laugh by itself. But he then said that his aim was economic recovery and reduced unemployment. What do we have? One year later, unemployment has increased by more than one per cent. Since his famous One Nation statement there have been nine jobs lost for every job created in this country. Our foreign debt is almost 20 per cent higher than it was when he came to the Prime Ministership 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This returns us to the basic question of this matter of public importance. We do not want to hear, as the Treasurer has been telling us, what the OECD says about Australia. We do not want to hear what some international forecaster, well removed from Australia, said about Australia some time ago. We want to hear what the Government's own forecasting body says is its obviously revised downward economic growth projection for this financial year because it means that it must be lower than 3 per cent. That means there will be more unemployment; shooting towards 12 per cent&mdash;even without the school leavers and the job shedding which I referred to earlier. It means that the Budget deficit is worse. More than ever, we are heading for the worst depression since the 1930s. We need a new government; we need a fresh start. The last thing Australians want is 12 per cent unemployment and more under this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both of the Opposition spokesmen during the discussion of the matter of public importance today have concentrated on two specific themes: firstly, the question of growth; and, secondly, what that means as far as employment is concerned. We constantly hear the plea for a bit of honesty in debate. We constantly hear the suggestion that a policy prescription is required which will see this growth improve and, as a consequence, again generate employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us try to inject a bit of honesty into the debate today. Most of the areas to which the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) referred in a breakdown of unemployment figures on a regional basis are manufacturing areas, or have as their base some form of manufacturing or small business. I represent such an area in this Parliament. In the last 10 or 12 years I have seen what industry, business and manufacturing have been doing in an endeavour to do something which people in the media, the economic forecasters and certainly those on the other side of this House called for two years ago: micro-economic reform and industrial restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want a bit of honesty in the debate I ask those honourable members opposite to stop and think for a moment. If they were those people in small- to medium-sized businesses, or indeed large businesses, and they were endeavouring to work smarter and more efficiently and bring in micro-economic reforms to their businesses, what would they do? They would cut costs. What is the first cost that most businesses will endeavour to cut? Businesses will endeavour to shed labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing businesses will do is introduce technology. In the last 10 years there has been an explosion in the use of technology in all forms of business in this country. It has replaced the need for manpower or womenpower in many of those businesses. To constantly harp that that factor should not be taken into consideration I think is abrogating some of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter is worthy of comment. We have heard a lot about the stimulatory processes of this Government through the One Nation statement, the Budget and other announcements which have been made. We heard cries of `What about the rail system?' and so on. I am reliably informed that in the electorate of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) the Brisbane to Gold Coast rail link, which was part of the One Nation statement, is proceeding at quite a considerable pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also informed by my colleague the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) that in the case of small business&mdash;which the Deputy Leader of the National Party referred to, saying that there were sackings and that small business opportunities were reducing&mdash;between April and December 1991, in the depths of the recession, 60,000 new jobs were created. That is based on BIE estimates and figures. It is a fact; we cannot escape it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue raised in the course of this debate related to forecasts. How many people in the public and private sectors in Australia, the United States, the UK, France and all of the OECD countries are now prepared to put up their hands and say that they got the forecasts about economic conditions in Australia, the US, the UK, France and all OECD countries right for the last one, two, four or five years? I think very few would do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures are simply forecasts based on the best available information provided by well qualified and well equipped people from the public and private sectors. The difference here is that the Government is prepared to suggest&mdash;and it has been said on a number of occasions&mdash;that those particular forecasts understated the extent to which the recession was both deeper and longer than anyone was able to predict. We have said that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no point dwelling on the past. It is a fact that there has been successive growth, albeit modest&mdash;and the Government has said that it is modest and we want more&mdash;for more than 12 months. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said&mdash;and it is certainly true in terms of the statistics which are available and which have been derided by those opposite in their contributions this afternoon&mdash;that that growth demonstrates clearly that we are way in front of OECD countries with regard to that process. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of unemployment always arouses the emotions of honourable members in debate and, to some extent, this takes away some of the rationality as well. I thought it was rather intriguing that the day after the unemployment figures were announced nationally as 11.3 per cent, the New South Wales Liberal Government, in one of the most cynical exercises I can recall, decided to sack thousands of workers in the State Rail Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria we have seen the effect of industrial relations policies as well. Yet those honourable members on the other side who give comfort to the policy prescriptions of their Liberal counterparts at the State level are prepared to turn a blind eye to that.

That is not the only thing that we have to consider. Also, we have to look at the program for tomorrow. As always, the program contains protection of the rights of private members. In our proposal we have allowed a situation to emerge in the Standing Orders for tomorrow whereby full weight is given to the normal conduct of business by private members in the House up until 2 o'clock. This means that there will be an opportunity for private members to make their statements and to state their grievances, and for Committee reports and the like to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that point on there is so much business to be conducted that it needs to be conducted purely under the banner of government business. There is no time for the normal practice of Question Time. There is always the chance that we will be engaged, too, as the night wears on, by the requirement to play some sort of legislative ping-pong with the Senate, which we also tend to do at this time of year. All of those considerations take into account that the Government will require, from 2 o'clock tomorrow, maximum flexibility for the consideration of its business, hence the decision to put to the House for its consideration the change in Standing Orders for tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition rejects this motion as yet again an outrageous demonstration of the lack of management of the Government's business. More importantly, we often have motions imposing the guillotine to facilitate government business through this place at the end of the year, but very seldom do we get to the position where Question Time is actually denied the Parliament. Tomorrow we will not have any Question Time, and I think that is outrageous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as we have seen during the course of the year, the number of Bills subject to the guillotine has increased alarmingly. We are well up in the hundreds now in terms of Bills that have been subject to the guillotine. This denies honourable members in this place the opportunity to speak and to argue their case with regard to particular Bills, and it also denies honourable members a proper committee stage in this place. The committee stage is where, clause by clause, a particular piece of legislation can be dealt with. That really is the way the legislature should work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly we are seeing a tendency for this Parliament to respond to the demands of the Executive which means not only is the Opposition denied the opportunity to speak but, more importantly perhaps from the point of view of Government backbenchers, there is no opportunity for them to speak either. I find it amazing that Government backbenchers continue to agree with the Executive of their own Party trammelling upon their rights as private members in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comment also has to be made about the difficulties we are experiencing with the amount and complexity of legislation. In an earlier debate I referred to an occasion when we had some new sales tax legislation and how that was actually guillotined through the Parliament. In the recent past we have also had dealings with a whole range of broadcasting and telecommunications legislation which I know the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is quite familiar with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the more contentious pieces of legislation, which would benefit from a detailed scrutiny by the Parliament, are being made subject to a Senate timetable. The Senate timetable and the mysteries of the way in which the Senate works continue to astound me. The time that it spends dealing with some of the matters which, in my view, do not deserve the weighty time that is given to them is quite amazing. This place is now being pushed considerably by the Senate's lack of timetabling or prioritising of its own arrangements. That is regrettable. That ought not be a reflection on my colleagues in the Senate. When I was at the Senate the other evening, they told me that the management of the Senate is the worst that many of them have seen in the number of years that they have been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is also part of the problem that we have to deal with on this side of the chamber and is part of the difficulties faced by the Leader of the House. But in any event, we are faced yet again with a denial of Question Time. We are faced again with the prospect of working right through Thursday and well into Friday morning, finishing at some early hour of the morning. When I said `early hour of the morning', my colleagues should be thinking of about 5 a.m.&mdash;rather than 1 a.m., and perhaps even later than 5 a.m.&mdash;or 6 a.m. But we are hoping that they will get to the airport and get home on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess there will be an opportunity for some comment later, but this may well be the last motion by the Leader of the House in this place if this week is the last time that this Parliament meets. I notice that Senator Richardson is now on his side. I do not know whether that should give the Leader of the House comfort or whether it should scare him. In any event, we watch with interest. We find it interesting that the Government has chosen to conform to its practice of the last several years of denying honourable members, by not managing the business of this place in a constructive way, the opportunity to debate issues. It is regrettable and reflects on the Government very adversely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that the centrepiece of democracy, which is seen by most people in this place as being important&mdash;that is, Question Time&mdash;will be denied yet again, although Question Time itself has developed into somewhat of a farce.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been the wont of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), when matters come up relating to parliamentary procedures, to tip a bucket on the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the Senate at a time when it did not sit until Christmas, the reason being that in those days this Government used to rush in its Bills at the end of session and say, `These are urgent; we have got to have them'. There would be a wish for a debate and maybe for some amendments in the Senate, but everyone would say, `It is too great a cost to bring back the House of Representatives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became the practice of the Government to bring in at the end of each session, not just at the end of the year, urgent Bills and Bills critical to the public. The Government assumed that it could guillotine the Bills in the House of Representatives after about two members had debated them, and put the same sort of pressure on the senators. A little while ago the Senate jacked up on that&mdash;not before time&mdash;and passed the Macklin amendment, insisting that it was going to debate Bills. I do not think there has ever been a better example than this session of how important that Macklin amendment was. This chamber received 70 new Bills in two days, and we had to put them through in a couple of weeks. We had no forewarning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely the worst ever. The Government is going from bad to worse. We have not had the opportunity to debate things that are of critical importance to our constituents and to this nation. That has been a deliberate decision by the Government. We talk about the management of Government business in the Senate, but I have a little sympathy for the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) because of the number of Bills that the Leader of the House piles onto him. He knows he has to cope with that number of Bills in such a period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least senators are trying to make their chamber act like a House of Parliament. This place has become an absolute farce from beginning to end. One of the reasons we are held in such appallingly low esteem, indeed outright disgust, by so many Australians is the way the House of Representatives is being run by the Government. At least the Senate is trying. It is about time that the Government took on board the fact that it cannot bring in a swag of Bills and not expect the Senate to have its go at examining them&mdash;and properly so. It is now only in the Senate that many people's concerns about Government activities and Government legislation are expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a poor excuse for bringing us back for two days this week to say that we have to put all this legislation through. There are more than two days in a week. We could have come back for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. It has transpired that the only glimpse of a chance that the Opposition has to put the Executive Government under scrutiny in this chamber is during Question Time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains a number of proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which are necessary in order to respond to certain recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and to resolve various practical problems which have arisen in the course of electoral administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also repeal the requirement that documents containing information about candidates and their policies be delivered to all households prior to the next election. Section 386A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was inserted last year as a result of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats during debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. The Government supported the amendment because it formed a part of what was seen as a package of measures, which included free time broadcasts, designed to ensure that the electorate was informed in the absence of political advertising of candidates' policies in the election. With the disallowance by the High Court of the legislation to ban political advertising, the case for the candidate booklet no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Electoral Act already provides for a free issue of the electoral roll, in computer format if required, to senators, members, registered political parties, and other persons and organisations deemed appropriate by the Electoral Commission, after each general election. This Bill will allow for the free, regular provision of supplements to the roll, in computer format, to all senators, members, and registered political parties which have parliamentary representation. Other groups will be able to obtain these supplements at cost. Habitation indexes are already issued free of charge by the Electoral Commission to registered political parties once in the life of a parliament. The Bill will allow for additional issues of the habitation index to registered political parties at cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to current concerns about privacy issues, this Bill will also provide that where computerised roll information on names and addresses is provided by the Electoral Commission to senators, members, registered political parties and other persons and organisations, that information must only be used for purposes related to enrolment and to elections and referendums, or in the case of other persons and organisations, purposes permitted by the regulations. Penalties are provided for the misuse of the information. In addition, personal electoral roll information will no longer be generally available under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its interim report on counting the vote on election night, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended that Electoral Commission officers conduct an indicative distribution of second and later preference votes for the House of Representatives on election night. This will provide the public on that night with an early indication of the two-candidate preferred result in most electorates. This legislation will require the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct such an indicative distribution of preferences. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters also recommended that scrutineers be given an explicit right to examine preferences on ballot papers. This legislation will give scrutineers the right to observe preferences so long as they do not unreasonably delay the scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report on the 1990 election, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended a prohibition on the distribution of material which discourages electors from numbering their ballot papers consecutively and fully. This legislation will make it an offence to intentionally encourage electors to mark their ballot papers in any way other than consecutively and fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its May 1991 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations peacekeeping and Australia</EMPHASIS>, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that an explicit function be conferred on the Australian Electoral Commission to provide assistance to foreign countries and international organisations in the conduct of elections and referendums in cases where such assistance is approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans). The Bill will confer such a function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also empower the Australian Electoral Commission to provide goods and services to members of the public and organisations in a manner not inconsistent with the performance of its primary functions. Such goods might include the provision of public roll information, and such services might include providing a roll scanning service to State electoral authorities. In the light of the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which recommended greater cooperation between Federal, State and Territory electoral authorities, legislation to permit the Electoral Commission to provide goods and services to those State and Territory electoral authorities is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the Government's commitment to the user pays principle, the Bill will also empower the Australian Electoral Commission to impose charges for the provision of goods and services. The Bill also provides for a new system of automatic enrolment of new citizens. At the time of applying for citizenship, a person will be able to make a provisional claim for electoral enrolment. The provisional claim for enrolment will be activated once the person concerned has been granted citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill includes a number of proposed minor amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to improve the efficiency of the electoral process and to resolve certain practical difficulties in electoral administration. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill contains a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. Some of these amendments result from recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Government asserts that others are designed to `resolve various practical problems which have arisen in the course of electoral administration'. Most importantly, the Bill repeals the requirement for biographical details of candidates to be distributed to each household in the lead-up to the next general election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular measure was introduced last year in the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1992. Indeed, this section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was inserted as a result of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats during debate on the Political Broadcasts Bill. In reality, the Government's agreement to this provision was part of the pay-off to the Democrats for supporting the ban on all political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition felt that this ban on political advertising was one of the most appalling attacks on the freedom of speech and political expression in this country. The ban scaled new heights even for this Labor Government, which seems to thrive on social engineering. As the House would be aware, we vigorously campaigned against the ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the introduction of the brochure was a political pay-back to the Democrats in return for their support for the advertising blackout. However, following the High Court's decision that the advertising ban was, in fact, unconstitutional and a gross attack on the freedom of speech of ordinary Australians, the Government is killing off the whole concept of introductory brochures. What this amounts to is a huge back flip by the Government. It did not get its own way in the advertising ban, so there is no way it is going to honour its commitment to the Democrats.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes this decision, not only because of the opportunism which this Bill offered to enterprising businesses but also because of the very significant savings it will generate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' amendment created a bizarre opportunity for local tradesmen and businesses to register and run for a House of Representatives seat. By virtue of this introductory brochure the particular tradesman or business would gain free advertising, reaching every person in the local region. I have no problem with businesses being that enterprising&mdash;certainly in these times of recession they need all the help they can get just to survive&mdash;but this loophole demonstrates the absolute stupidity of the Democrats' proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a Senate Estimates committee, repealing this amendment will save the taxpayer some $3m. My colleague Senator Parer, the shadow Minister for administrative services, has calculated that the savings are more likely to be in the vicinity of $5m to $10m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes a number of other amendments, some of which I would like briefly to comment upon. Clause 4 of the Bill results from recommendation 13 of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations peacekeeping and Australia</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that steps be taken to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, or any other relevant regulatory change be made, to give the Australian Electoral Commission the function of providing assistance in the form of the secondment of personnel, or the supply or loan of material to a foreign government or to an international organisation in connection with the preparation for or the conduct of an overseas election or referendum as approved by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This function should be reflected in the organisational structure of the Commission'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has already made its expertise available for the United Nations peacekeeping operations in Namibia; the proposal to install a United Nations administration which would organise and conduct free elections in Cambodia; and preparatory work in connection with the proposed referendum to be held in Western Sahara to give the people of the Territory a choice between independence and integration with Morocco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Bill allows the Australian Electoral Commission to provide goods and services to other organisations or individuals&mdash;for example, a scanning service for assistance in the conduct of elections to the States. Importantly, and according to the user-pays principle, the Bill provides for the Electoral Commission to charge a fair and reasonable fee for these services. Clause 6 ensures that the Australian Electoral Commission lists the names of people who are required or may be required to provide a return showing donations to candidates or political parties in its report to the Minister. This measure arises from amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 following debate on the political broadcasts and political disclosures legislation last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Electoral Commission will be allowed to employ temporary staff and consultants to enhance public awareness of electoral and parliamentary matters under new provisions introduced in this Bill. Similarly, the Commission will also be obliged to regularly provide&mdash;free of charge&mdash;supplements to the electoral roll in computer format to all senators, members and registered political parties which have parliamentary representation. Other groups in the community will be able to purchase these supplements at some cost. In addition, the amendment allows registered political parties which presently receive habitation indexes from the Australian Electoral Commission to obtain extra copies at some cost. Clause 11 of the Bill tightens the copyright relating to the use of information contained on the electoral roll and habitation index. As such, tape and disk copies are now protected in a similar manner to the hard copies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new system of automatic enrolment of new citizens is introduced in this Bill. Under the new arrangements, those applying for citizenship may, at the same time, make a provisional claim for electoral enrolment, which would be activated when citizenship is granted. The Bill eliminates the need for the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise the receipt of an application for the registration of a political party. However, this is largely confined to cases where the Commission concludes in its initial consideration of the application that it is required to refuse the application, and where the applicant declines to vary the application to remedy its defects. On the other hand, if the applicant is prepared to vary the application in accordance with the Australian Electoral Commission's suggestion, the varied application is treated as the new application and an advertisement is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 20 of the Bill eliminates the restriction of the Australian Electoral Commission to appoint a deputy presiding officer for a polling place where there will be fewer than six issuing points at any time during the hours of polling on polling day. This amendment results from a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and is designed to increase flexibility in staffing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 22 provides for an Australian electoral officer in a given State or Territory to direct an indicative distribution of second and late preference votes at a House of Representatives election for any division in that State on polling night. The Australian Electoral Commission suggests that this will mean a much earlier indication of actual preference distributions on election nights. Previously preferences have not been distributed until the Tuesday or Wednesday following the election. As such, candidates and voters have relied on scrutineers' estimates as reported by media commentators on election night. Whilst trials by the Electoral Commission show that the new arrangements will take 15 to 30 minutes longer to count preferences, the results will be much more reliable. Indeed, one could say that the count will be slower to start but quicker to finish. Evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, whose recommendation initiated this change, suggests that the clause has been deliberately worded to be permissive and is not mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Director of Public Prosecutions has advised that in the case of a misleading how-to-vote card which falsely represented that a candidate had endorsements from groups that had not endorsed him, it was not possible to bring criminal proceedings. This is because it could not be shown by admissible evidence that any particular person was responsible for publishing or distributing the cards. The cards bore the name of the printer and of the person who had authorised them, but the fact that the person was named on the card is not regarded as admissible evidence against that person; rather it is considered to be hearsay evidence. There is nothing in the current Act to facilitate proof that a person named in election material is familiar with that material. The legal issue lies in the difficulty of proving who was responsible for a misleading endorsement on a how-to-vote card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian Electoral Commission investigations cannot find independent witnesses who saw the acts of distribution, the names of the printer and the authorising person listed on the card are not enough evidence to convict them of crimes against the Act. The proposed amendment will remedy this situation by providing that, where a person has been named on electoral material, this can be used as prima facie evidence in proceedings against that person for an offence against the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 26 of the Bill extends a legal privilege to enrolment documents. As the law stands, enrolment documents cannot be subpoenaed. The effect of this new clause is to give the Australian Electoral Commission a discretion as to whether or not the information is released to the Australian Federal Police. The current law makes the Electoral Commission liable to produce any documents demanded by the Federal Police under a proper warrant issued by a magistrate. However, section 390 of the Act has removed the requirement for the Electoral Commission to produce documents in any court. There is some obvious inconsistency here. The proposed amendment is designed to give the Electoral Commission the power to decide whether it will cooperate with a request for information from the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this amendment on the proviso that the Australian Electoral Commission's discretion should be exercised only in accordance with the information privacy principles under the Privacy Act, or with guidelines which are similar to those principles. My colleagues in the Senate have already indicated that the coalition will not be opposing this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating an omnibus Bill containing a range of amendments to implement some of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as well as a range of other reforms to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. Of themselves, the reforms are not particularly controversial. However, they are important reforms. In my contribution this afternoon I will speak briefly about some of them and I will speak in a little more depth about the changes concerning access to electoral rolls and to habitation indexes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the measures included in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill are, in my mind, important. The Bill deals with the deletion of the requirement to provide candidate information booklets to all Australian households. This requirement formed part of the package which the Government introduced in relation to the controlling of electronic advertising of political broadcasts. As we all know, it is now part of history that that legislation was struck down in the High Court. As a result, since advertisements are now permissible, it is no longer necessary to send out these candidate information booklets which were to provide all electors with some basic policy information about their local candidates, as well as, I understand, Senate candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give honourable members an idea of what would have been involved here. The AEC did some preliminary work on putting this booklet together. It is an enormous booklet. It reminds me a little of the ballot paper that appeared in the first election for local government in the Australian Capital Territory, which was about the largest piece of paper I had seen. But this booklet would go somewhere near it. I do not know how effective it would have been in the end. I cannot imagine people wading through this in a great deal of detail to get all the information about their Senate and local candidates. Nonetheless, the intent behind it was probably sound in light of the measures which were being introduced at that time. Since that is no longer the case, there is no longer a need for the booklet. One of the measures contained in this Bill is to remove the need for that booklet to be produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second matter which I think is extremely important deals with allowing on the night of the election an interim distribution of preferences in those divisions where preferences will be crucial to the result. The way in which this measure will work, according to clause 22 of the Bill, is that the State electoral officer will decide in which divisions it will be required to conduct a preliminary scrutiny of preferences. I assume that in practice that will not be seats like your own, Mr Deputy Speaker, where you will be returned with a thumping majority, but seats a bit like my own which are rather marginal and will probably, I concede, go to preferences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the confidence of my colleague, but it will occur in seats where the likelihood is that the results will be known only with preferences and it may be quite a close result. In the past it has taken many days for results in individual seats to be known. Even after the 1990 election it was some days before the result of the election was 100 per cent clear. It was not thought unlikely on the night of the election that the Government had been returned, but there were enough close seats that that position was in some doubt for a few days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember my own experience after the 1987 election when the result in Fisher was, I think, the closest in Australia. Certainly, after the election I held the most marginal Government seat in Australia and it took three days of recounting and relying on advice from party scrutineers to be absolutely confident that I had won the seat. While that was rather unsettling and nerve-racking for me, I think it is not a particularly desirable outcome for this country that situations such as that should be allowed to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill allows a preliminary scrutiny of second and other preferences on the night of an election. That will be conducted by the polling officers in each individual polling booth. In the vast majority of cases it will allow a result to be pretty well determined on the night. There will still, I suppose, be a handful of cases which will be so close that postal and section votes will be necessary in order to be absolutely confident, but that will be a small number of cases. We will not have the ludicrous situation, as we did after the 1990 election, of going through the weekend not being 100 per cent certain whether the Government had been returned or whether a new government had been elected. I very much welcome that reform. I think it is a very positive one both for the candidates involved and, more importantly, for our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment concerns what I would describe as provisional enrolment for new citizens. I might describe this as the McLeay amendment because Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), some years ago when I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters raised with me his view that a better system in relation to people taking out citizenship would be to include in that process an automatic way in which people could be added to the electoral roll so that when their citizenship actually went through they were added to the roll. At the moment new citizens are sent their little parcel of goodies together with their certificate of citizenship and an enrolment form to get on the roll. Obviously the vast majority of people do then go on to enrol, but it makes sense in terms of getting all the forms signed at one time that, when people are making their applications for citizenship, they can also at that stage choose to make an application to become enrolled and, if they proceed with the citizenship, that happens automatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similar, I suppose, to the current position where 17-year-olds can enrol and, if they turn 18, say, during the closing of the rolls if an election is called, be added to the roll. I find that a very worthwhile provision which currently operates, in my mind, very well. I think this is another one to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A measure contained in this Bill which I am not aware of having been heavily canvassed to date deals with the provision and use of the electoral roll itself, particularly in computer format. Australia has always had an open electoral system. I think we can take some pride in this country in the strength of our electoral system. Indeed, the term the `Australian ballot', which is essentially a secret ballot, still has some currency in parts of the United States as the description of the electoral system which was adopted. Certainly, we can take pride in the way in which we have run our Electoral Commission and the way in which we have conducted elections in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our rolls have always been freely available to people. They can go down to their local divisional returning office and check whether they are on the roll or whether other people are on the roll. Indeed, I think a system still exists whereby people may lodge an objection. If they lodge a $2 fee or something like that they can complain that somebody is wrongfully enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information which has been generally available at a Commonwealth level in a public form has been a person's name and address. However, the Australian Electoral Commission has information beyond that. When people enrol, not only do they give their name and address, but they indicate, naturally enough, their gender and also, importantly, their date of birth and occupation. That information is contained in the Commission on its computer files, but is not made publicly available in terms of the printed roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues of who should have access to the Commission's information, how that information should be updated and to what use it should be put are important. They are particularly important in the context of the privacy debate, in which I am sure the House has taken some interest. It is a particular interest of mine, given that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, is at present conducting an inquiry into the protections currently afforded to confidential Commonwealth information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real focus for this debate became evident following the release of the report of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption on the misuse of confidential information in the State of New South Wales. That report revealed that there was within the State of New South Wales an extremely widespread network of people procuring and selling confidential information. This included a range of New South Wales public officials, including police officers, who were disclosing information either directly for money or in exchange for further information. Although Commissioner Roden in his report was not asked to look at the Commonwealth Government, he found in his inquiries that a range of Commonwealth Government employees from a range of Commonwealth Government agencies had been involved in this illicit trade of confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees in the Department of Social Security, the Health Insurance Commission, Telecom, Australia Post, the Customs department and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs were all involved, according to the ICAC report, in this information exchange network. As the Committee had already commenced its inquiry into these broad issues, we were also asked by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to report to him and to the Parliament in relation to the appropriate Commonwealth response to the ICAC report and the implications for Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the specific findings which Commissioner Roden made about corrupt conduct in New South Wales, he made three general rules, if you like, which were fundamental in terms of restricting the illicit trade in official information. He outlined several points that needed to be resolved. First, a clear line had to be drawn between information which is publicly available and that which is retained as confidential&mdash;which may seem very basic, but he found that often that clearly had not been determined. There was not a policy for what was to be regarded as confidential and what was to be available publicly. Secondly, when it is decided that information should be made available in a public sense, it should be provided readily, quickly and cheaply. Thirdly, if it is decided that a piece of information or a type of information is to be confidential, it must be properly protected with appropriate safeguards being put into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us tonight addresses points one and two of those three general rules in relation to the provision of the electoral roll and habitation indexes. It goes some of the way towards deciding what information is to be publicly available and what is to be confidential. It also decides how information which is to be publicly available can be made available. Currently, the AEC holds extremely important information. I should add that there was no suggestion in the ICAC report of any wrongdoing on the part of the Australian Electoral Commission. No employees were named, and there was no inference at all in any of the evidence that there was any wrongdoing whatsoever occurring within the Australian Electoral Commission. I make that very clear. Nonetheless, these are issues which are important to the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that the Commission holds is currently made available to some 21 government agencies. It is made available to members of parliament and to political parties. There have been a number of problems with the general scheme of the way in which this information should go. Firstly, there was an apparent conflict between the operation of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Freedom of Information Act in relation to the availability in an electronic form or computer format of rolls and habitation indexes. The Commission does not make the roll publicly available in a computer form. People can go into an electoral office and buy a hard copy of a divisional roll, but not a computer tape of the roll. Yet the AEC had received a number of applications under the Freedom of Information Act for that very information. So we had the Freedom of Information Act apparently allowing access to this information but the Australian Commonwealth Electoral Act saying, `No, only a hard copy, a printed copy, is to be available'. This matter was raised by the Commission in public evidence given to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and I am pleased to say that the matter has been resolved in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the Bill is also consistent with the advice given to Senator Bolkus, the Minister responsible for the Commission, by Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, that the Freedom of Information Act should not apply to this information; that the scheme regarding the control of the information and its dissemination should be contained purely within the Australian Electoral Act. This Bill resolves that point. I think it goes some of the way to resolving those three basic issues which Commissioner Roden posed as matters that have to be determined to be certain that information is being adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other issues which the Bill does not touch, nor would one expect it to, which are issues for the Australian Electoral Commission. One of those deals with its own staff and the information that it gains. For instance, the Commission has a responsibility to maintain the rolls in as accurate a state as possible. Regularly it does what is called a habitation review in order to maintain the rolls. It now has the power to go to other agencies to seek advice in furtherance of this aim of maintaining the rolls. For instance, it can go to Australia Post to look at its records to see who is living at various addresses and it can do a check for its own purposes. That is allowed for both in the guidelines under which Australia Post operates and also in the specific authority given to the Commission. It can gain information from other Commonwealth agencies and other sources in a like manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the Commission has no guidelines about the protection of the information it is gaining from third sources or when is the appropriate occasion that this information shall be sought. The ICAC report showed that it was not so much that information was leaking out directly but, rather, if people wanted to get some sort of Customs information, they might end up getting it out of an employee of a county council or an employee of the traffic authority in New South Wales because of this exchange of information between agencies. So it is important that we are aware of that and that the Commission is aware of that and is developing guidelines to make sure that this information, when sought from other agencies, is adequately protected. In evidence before the Committee, the Commission's witnesses advised us that they were aware of this problem, they were developing guidelines towards it, but were some way down the track from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which is important in terms of joint roles between the Commonwealth and the States is where information, which the Commonwealth gathers and is stringent in its own protection, is passed onto the States for the maintenance of State rolls, but where there is necessarily no equivalent of the Privacy Act applying in all States and no such control once the information leaves the immediate arm's length of the Commonwealth. What the States are doing with it and how they handle this information, particularly with occupation, date of birth and so on, is also an issue which I think the Commonwealth will have to raise with the States and, one hopes, will resolve. Certainly the Bill before us tonight is important. It makes a number of changes, it improves the law as it concerns the protection of information, and I commend it to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take the time of the House to refresh honourable members' memories as to the effect of this section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It was simply to allow for a massive booklet giving the profile of candidates at a Federal election to be sent to every household. That would allow minority parties such as the Democrats or Independents to have massive taxpayer subsidies for their political purposes. In other words, the Democrats were trying to circumvent the usual political process, which is to garner support from the general public by way of physical contributions, by manning polling booths, handing out literature, or by contributing funds which are fully disclosable. So the Democrats, with the assistance of the Government, were trying to take a short cut and not do the hard, political slog. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a grubby deal, as the shadow Minister reminds me. In fact, it was nothing more than a bribe. I will also refresh honourable members' memories as to the timing of this agreement, or unholy alliance, between the Government and the Democrats. That amendment to section 386A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was inserted at the same time as there was debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill&mdash;in other words, the ban on political advertising&mdash;and that legislation was later struck out by the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put these events into sequence. Some 12 months ago the Government needed the Democrats' support to get through the Senate the ban on political advertising. It allowed this massive transfer of taxpayers' funds to the Democrats to allow for this mail out to all households of profiles of their candidates and others. The legislation goes through and then gets struck out, rightly&mdash;as we predicted&mdash;in the case before the High Court which the Opposition initiated. Now the Government reneges on the deal with the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The booklet has gone now and I am still waiting for an apology from any Government member for, firstly, taking up the Parliament's time in the initial legislation and the subsequent legislation and, secondly, the money involved in changing the legislation some 12 months ago and now having to change it again&mdash;all because the Government has reneged on the Democrats. Talk about thieves falling out! The Government does a grubby deal with the Democrats to get its political ban legislation through by bribing them with this political propaganda booklet which it agrees to send to all households. Now that the High Court has struck out the legislation, which was the original reason for this agreement between the Government and the Democrats, the Government has reneged on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not have their booklet; they do not have their taxpayer-funded political campaign. As it is, taxpayers&mdash;without any recourse to a referendum, I hasten to add&mdash;have to pay some 40c or 50c for every vote a registered political party gains in the House of Representatives and about $1 for every vote it gains in the Senate. Of the order of $15m or $16m is devoted to publicly funded Federal campaigns. The Government wanted to add to that. Can honourable members imagine the cost of compiling, printing and distributing these booklets to each of the 148 House of Representatives electorates and for all of the Senate areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Commission estimates, conservatively, that abandoning the idea of sending a booklet to every household will save $3m. On our equally conservative estimates, we believe that between $5m and $10m will be saved to taxpayers by the abandonment of this ludicrous idea that every household get a booklet with every candidate profiled. The message to the Democrats, the Independents and minor political parties, as it is to the major political parties&mdash;the Labor, Liberal and National parties&mdash;is to get out there and win support. Talk about accountability! Why should the Democrats, with their failing national support and disintegration in Victoria, turn to the taxpayer to maintain them as a political party and give some of those useless senators that they have representing them in the other place a job? The message is that they should  get out there and be accountable for their policies, ideas and performance, and people will support them or they will not. They will give that support either by hands-on contributions or by funds&mdash;all of which we have to reveal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No unholy deals should be done, as has happened between the Government and the Democrats. We do not hear much complaint from the Democrats about this. They have been caught out. What are they going to do? Will they go to the Australian public and say, `The Government has reneged on the deal that we struck a year ago and they are very bad people.'? To do so they would have to reveal the existence of the deal in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder where the inquisitive media is at a time such as this. The media will always investigate anything surrounding the personalities in politics and so many of the irrelevancies, but when a really dishonest bribe occurs between the Government and the Democrats they are nowhere to be seen. What other explanation is there for the Government's agreeing to the funding of the booklet, which will so advantage the Democrats, and now, 12 months later, repealing it? It can only be because the Government no longer needs the Democrats' support to maintain the electronic advertising ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Government should hang their heads in shame. I wish more Australians knew what they are prepared to do to serve their own political purposes. Twelve months ago they thought that a ban on electronic advertising would suit them and benefit them, and they were prepared to pay any price&mdash;not out of their own pockets, Labor members never do, but out of the pockets of taxpayers. Now that that ban on political advertising cannot be enforced at law, they will abandon their deals with the Democrats. I think the Government and the Democrats stand equally condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder the Democrats are so desperate to get the taxpayer subsidised electoral advantages that the booklet would have given them. If the Party has its seven senators standing at the next Federal election, it would lose party status and could easily be wiped out, as the DLP was in the 1974 election. Sadly, only two of the Democrats are up for a vote this time, and honourable members can be sure that neither of them will be returned. I hasten to correct myself by saying that now that Senator Janet Powell from Victoria has left the Democrats, the Party is down to six. </PARA>

There is no evidence that I am aware of&mdash;and I would be happy to be corrected&mdash;that fish species have become extinct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in the second reading debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1992 is to address the clauses that relate to questions that have come before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am pleased to say that a number of matters in this Bill reflect concerns that have been raised in a couple of reports from the Standing Committee. At the outset, it is important to acknowledge in this place that Australia is well served by having an Electoral Act, an electoral system and a network of commissions at both Commonwealth and State levels that provide a high quality service, an impartial service and one which is regarded around the world as first rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a set of amendments before us which seek to improve on what is internationally recognised as a fair and proper system&mdash;a system which, by and large, is well administered. That is not to say that there are no problems and that there is no room for improvement. At the outset, though, it is worth acknowledging that we are debating amendments to what is a fine system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 of the Bill makes an alteration to provide easier access for new Australians to exercise their rights as new Australians in determining the government of this country. The amendment provides for a provisional claim for enrolment by applicants for citizenship so that at the time they become citizens they will automatically have an enrolment recorded in their favour. That will provide many new Australians with speedier access to exercising their votes as new Australians. As has been mentioned in this debate, that issue was raised by the Committee about three years ago. It is one in which a number of members of this Parliament have taken an interest. I am very pleased to see that the Government has picked up that issue and has sought to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 so that new Australians exercise their right to vote at the earliest opportunity after becoming Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other amendments which are probably of more direct interest to some honourable members in this place&mdash;most notably, the changes occurring in the scrutiny and counting of ballot papers. The Bill gives effect to some recommendations from the Committee on Electoral Matters on the counting of ballot papers that would require an indicative distribution of second and later preferences to the two candidates identified by the Electoral Commission as most likely to win. Proposed new subsection 274(2A) states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory that includes the Division must, in writing, direct the Assistant Returning Officer for the Division also to count such preference votes (other than first preference votes), on such of the ballot papers, as, in the opinion of the Australian Electoral Officer, will provide an indication of which candidate is most likely to be elected for the Division.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the concerns of the honourable member for Moncrieff. She raised this matter when the Committee delivered an interim report on this question. It is true that there will be some seats where it is not possible, with the best will in the world, to identify two candidates who might be considered most likely to win. There are a number of seats&mdash;we do not need to try to identify them here and now&mdash;where we would reasonably expect a three-cornered contest to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those situations, the Australian Electoral Officer will be put in the position of having to select two of those three. It may be that the Australian Electoral Officer will make an error. Going on the results of the 1990 election and the estimates provided to the Committee by the AEC and media observers, probably seven or eight errors occurred last time in exercising that judgment. However, the proposals taken as a whole will ensure that that difficulty is overcome on election night by extending the powers of scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 25 of the Bill extends the powers of scrutineers to ensure that scrutineers have access to every ballot paper and every preference. At the conclusion of the two-candidate preferred count&mdash;the indicative count which clause 26 provides for&mdash;I would think that, in the three-cornered contest seats, the scrutineers for the relevant parties would carefully scrutinise each of the other ballot papers. So they would leave the room with the very clear knowledge of the indicative count done by the AEC officers and, as scrutineers, they would also have a very clear indication in order to advise their candidates exactly where the preferences were falling on that night. That was the fundamental problem which the Standing Committee sought to address in its 1990 report. It looked at some of the problems associated with not knowing the result of the election on the evening of the 1990 general election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken together, those two alterations will result in candidates&mdash;and the public through the media&mdash;being aware of the most likely outcome in every seat. In the great bulk of seats that information will be as a result of the indicative count which officers of the Australian Electoral Commission will perform under the supervision of scrutineers. For those seats where that two-candidate indicative count may not give the result, the Bill inserts quite clear rights for scrutineers to ensure that they know where the preferences have been allocated on all of the ballot papers and are able to provide the appropriate advice to the candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practical terms, that achieves the most desirable outcome. It provides the most authoritative account possible where most seats are concerned; that is, where it is a choice in the end between the two most likely candidates. That will be the case in the great bulk of seats. Most seats will be determined by that most authoritative count. The outcome of the other seats, which may well determine government, will be better known on election night 1993 than was the case in 1990, because in 1993, unlike 1990, the scrutineers will have quite clear and express authority to peruse every ballot paper. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of other points are raised in the Bill which I want to mention quickly. Clause 27 of the Bill makes it an offence to encourage persons to mark their ballot papers otherwise than consecutively and fully if that advice is given during the election period. I think that is an important inclusion in the Act. There are provisions in the Act to ensure that people who cast a vote have every opportunity to have their intention recorded. Those provisions should not be used as loopholes for some sections of the community to seek to undermine the basic compulsory nature of voting or the preferential nature of the voting system. This clause seeks to address that problem. The Bill as a whole makes a number of significant improvements to the procedures followed by the AEC, both on election night and prior to election night in enrolling Australian citizens to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Bill to the House. I think the work which has been undertaken by the Government in revising the current procedures and reviewing the work of the Committee has been fruitful. The end result is a system which is fairer and which will provide on election night 1993 a much speedier and, I suspect, more accurate final count for the evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to respond to a couple of points contained in the speech by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). When the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was debated here, I sought the opportunity to speak briefly to it because it seemed to me that the recommendations which were being made overlooked the situation where three candidates had a genuine chance of winning a seat. I subsequently received a telephone call from the Deputy Electoral Commissioner. I have not yet had the opportunity to return that call, but I shall. He indicated that he wanted to discuss the matter further with me. I acknowledge that the Electoral Commission wants to do the right thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am concerned that the speech of the honourable member for Brisbane will be taken by the Electoral Commission as some sort of a solution to these difficult situations. He does not know what he is talking about in some cases and I really have to point these out. I have scrutineered many times. I have been in the Liberal Party for 32 years and I have certainly scrutineered many elections. Of course, I cannot scrutineer when I am a candidate, and that accounts for the last 18 1/2 elections. So I get counted out of a number. We have lot of Federal elections, as the honourable member is aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the honourable member is not familiar with the situation in electorates where there is a multiplicity of country booths, for example. In the electorate of Moncrieff in the last election I think I had 49 booths, which ranged in numbers of voters from 100 to 6,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those, like the honourable member for Forrest, who have rather larger rural areas than I would have many more polling booths. Our large rural electorates would have dozens and dozens of booths with just a handful of votes being cast at a number of them. There is nothing wrong with that; we must make that facility available to the public in order to assist their being able to vote. But certain things flow from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage I said that the honourable member's remarks were insulting because he was referring to whether scrutineers were capable of doing this, that and the other. There are two issues involved. Firstly, at small booths parties sometimes have difficulty getting someone to scrutineer. It is always a case of having one person on the booth all day, with that person then going on to do the scrutineering. At the end of 12 hours hard work they are supposed to be mentally alert to do, in those cases where there are three possibilities, what is a really difficult job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I used to teach maths and I know about permutations and combinations. That is the reason why I said that the honourable member must have schoolteachers scrutineering all of his votes. It can be very tricky indeed. It is virtually impossible to explain it to some booth workers when they have to watch a multiplicity of situations. I will explain what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, the first time I stood for the electorate of Moncrieff, there were six candidates. There were the four major parties&mdash;Liberal, National, Labor and Democrat&mdash;and two Independents. There were three potential winners&mdash;Labor, Liberal and National. It really was not possible to tell in advance which party would win. Clearly, the full flow-through of preferences of all the minor candidates&mdash;the Democrats and the two Independents&mdash;had to be recorded in order to get the sort of result we are talking about here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not quick or easy to do; it is very difficult when one thinks about it because one has to watch the full flow-through. Let us say one or a number of preferences go from one Independent to the next Independent to the Democrats and then to the National Party or the Liberal Party. Scrutineers have to watch the flow-through of five steps at once. If the returning officer in the booth with 100 votes, let us say, is good enough to turn over those votes one at a time and stand there while the scrutineers do their calculations, that is fine. But what do they do in the booths with 6000 votes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the votes are not all counted at one table; they are counted at a number of tables. But we are still talking about many hundreds of votes per table. I do not know of any training that we can give scrutineers which will enable them to perform the task. I tried it. I understand the complexities and I also understand the limitations of people who do not do this for a living. We love looking at ballot papers, preferences flows and doing the sums. We live it&mdash;and so we should; it is our bread and butter. But a lot of people out there do not really live this 365 days a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We try to give scrutineers a seminar two nights before election day. We say, `Here is the piece of paper. You have to watch four steps with each ballot paper. You have to know where each one of those Independent votes is going. Is it ultimately going to Liberal, Labor or National? If it goes to, let us say, Liberal before it goes to National, you have to make sure that it does not go on to Labor; you have to see whether it will go on to National or Labor'.

I like to listen to its election commentary on car radio as I go to various venues on election night if it is a State election. If it is a Federal election and if I am in the one place, I watch the commentary on the television that night. I hope the ABC, with all of its little trinkets, playthings and gewgaws, will do a better job covering this Federal election than it did covering the last State election. I spent a great deal of the time after the close of polls on State election night in Queensland actually listening to results on the car radio. There were six State electorates within my Federal electorate and I wanted to visit all of the centres where party people were gathering to hear the results. I did not hear a single sensible set of figures given over the radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had watched a bit of the coverage on television, so I knew what all of the commentators were doing. They had their noses glued to a screen which nobody in the television viewing audience could see. They were chatting to one another about what they could see on a computer screen, but nobody else could see it. The ABC probably would not show it on the television anyway because, like the scrutineers that the honourable member for Brisbane referred to, the commentators are highly trained people who can actually interpret what they are seeing on their screen. The general public cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has not been listening. I will not repeat it from the top. The honourable member for Brisbane said that we can train scrutineers to do these mental gymnastics and these mathematical feats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put this on the record. I hope somebody from the ABC or commercial radio or television is listening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is easy to say, but I think the exercise is a bit harder. I have scrutineered plenty of Brisbane electorates. They have tended to involve the Liberal Party versus the Labor Party, and the National Party was a genuine third party in Brisbane electorates up until the last election. I do not think that situation will return. Brisbane and seats in the other major population centres will be contested essentially between the Liberal and Labor parties, the Democrats, who will be a major third force in terms of where their preferences go, and the occasional Independent. That leads to a fairly easy exercise but where we have three genuine contestants, whether they be from the major parties or outstanding Independent candidates, the exercise is a very difficult one. I reiterate that it is the difficult exercises that are the slow ones. They are usually the electorates that the attention is focused on days after the election campaign because they are the ones that determine the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, anything that speeds up the analysis of preferences is welcomed&mdash;not least because of the incredibly stupid comments one hears on the radio and television on election night from some of the commentators. They might say that so and so has won a seat, but do not take any account of the likely drift of preferences. That happens over and over again. Anyone sitting there, say, in the old days looking at DLP preferences and knowing that they went about 80 per cent anti-Labor, and these days looking at the Democrat preferences and knowing that in most metropolitan seats they go about 60 per cent pro-Labor, can start doing a bit of mental arithmetic, for those of us who dabble in that, and make a better guess.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992 is returned from the Senate with amendments relating to the ethics side of the NHMRC. The Opposition is opposed to the amendments inasmuch as they do not go far enough to address the major problems which we have raised in this place previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the problems is that it is inappropriate for the NHMRC, a body which has as one of its major functions the promotion of research, also to be responsible for the ethics considerations relating to that research which, by and large, would tend to slow down or inhibit aspects of that research. There is clearly a conflict of functions here between the two aspects of the NHMRC's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the Opposition is and has been since the publication of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation in 1985, I believe, that there should be a separation of the ethics functions into a separate body, which may or may not be a statutory authority, so that the ethics considerations can be taken away from under the umbrella of the NHMRC and considered in complete separation and isolation, free of any influence which might encourage that ethics body to encourage research and, therefore, to dilute or water down any provisions to protect the subjects in particular of experimentation. One of the areas involved, of course, is the question of experimentation on embryos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the amendments do is to define the functions of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. It becomes a principal committee of the NHMRC. The members are defined, but the members are also principal committee members of other committees in the NHMRC. I am pleased to see that it does state that the recommendations of the AHEC must be accepted by the NHMRC&mdash;and we certainly support that as far as it goes&mdash;and also that the guidelines for medical research must be tabled, although not necessarily approved by both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, however, the problem with the amendments as they relate to this piece of legislation is that there is still no separation, as such. We are talking about the same members wearing different hats and therefore having a conflict of responsibilities. We would prefer to see the guidelines for medical research not only tabled, but requiring the approval of both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an amendment foreshadowed by Senator Harradine in the other House relating to the issue of embryo experimentation. This was never put to the other place, mainly because the Government decided that it would not allow a conscience vote on an issue as important as this. The position of the coalition was that the question of embryo experimentation was such an important issue that we would allow a conscience vote, but this was blocked by Government members not being allowed that freedom and the usual rigidity which occurs in the Labor Party being imposed on its members in such an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very sad that such an important issue should be decided on party lines when it is clearly a matter of conscience. I am disappointed that that particular issue was not able to be put in the other House. I reiterate that the amendments improve the Bill, but they do not go far enough for the Opposition. For that reason, we are unhappy about the current situation and we oppose the amendments as they stand. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) I am pleased to present the latest in a series of initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. The problems caused by tobacco consumption cannot be denied and the Government can see no justification for promoting tobacco sales in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will establish a national prohibition on tobacco advertising, expanding the existing bans in the broadcasting and print media and complementing the action of those States and Territories which have introduced their own restrictions on tobacco promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts about the impact of tobacco on health in Australia are clear and stark. Tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. In 1990 over 18,000 people died before their time because they smoked. In addition, smoking was estimated to present an annual cost to the Australian economy of over $6.8 billion in 1988. Tobacco use is clearly a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, although smoking rates are declining from the extraordinary levels seen at the end of World War 2, some 28 per cent of adult Australians currently smoke. Thus, at least for the medium term future, it is not possible for the Government to simply make tobacco an illegal substance. Like powerful drugs, firearms and other legal, although dangerous, products, however, advertising of tobacco products should be severely limited. This is especially so when advertising has the effect, intended or otherwise, of persuading children to take up an addictive life-threatening habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To coordinate national action on the tobacco issue, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments adopted the national health policy on tobacco in March 1991. This policy recognises the need for a diverse range of measures to reduce tobacco related harm. Marketing, availability, taxation, education, passive smoking and cessation services are each separately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is the latest in a series of initiatives by this Government to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. Achievements to date include a ban on smoking in Commonwealth buildings, a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media to extend the established broadcast media ban, a ban on smoking during airline flights and a ban on the sale of chewing tobacco and oral snuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government increased tobacco excise by over 10 per cent in the last Budget, leading to increased prices and reduced consumption. Furthermore, significant funding has been provided for education programs including the very successful `Smoking. Who Needs It!' campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand that removing tobacco advertising is primarily a prevention activity intended to reduce the number of children taking up smoking. Although advertising may not directly cause children to smoke, it reinforces other influences such as peer and social pressures which cause children to smoke. Tobacco advertisements glamorise smoking, making it seem like a desirable activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reminded by the recent decision of the High Court that free speech is a value fundamental to Australia. Serious consideration must therefore be given to any restrictions on free speech, including commercial free speech. However, tobacco advertising is a clear case of where restrictions on speech are appropriate in light of the need to protect the community's health, especially the health of its children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we accept the claim of the tobacco companies that their advertising is directed towards increasing market share, not recruiting new smokers, it is stretching credibility beyond its bounds to claim that this advertising has no effect on total consumption. Tobacco advertising supports and reinforces pressures to take up smoking and increases the difficulties encountered in quitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is plenty of evidence to indicate that tobacco advertising increases tobacco consumption. A recent draft discussion paper released by the United Kingdom Department of Health used a variety of methods to examine the effect of tobacco advertising and reviewed existing research. One of the conclusions of this paper was that `the balance of evidence thus supports the conclusion that advertising does have a positive effect on consumption'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has also demonstrated the beneficial effects of tobacco advertising prohibitions such as those contained in this Bill. The same discussion paper examined the effect of advertising bans in several countries. On this matter, the paper concluded that `in each case the banning of advertising was followed by a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco advertising in association with sport is particularly insidious as it seeks to link an unhealthy product with a healthy activity. Sponsorship of sporting and cultural activities has been exploited as an effective form of tobacco advertising. For example, a sponsor's name or logo may be recognisable for up to one third of the broadcast time of a major sporting event. One estimate is that a tobacco sponsored team received the commercial equivalent of over $4.5m worth of advertising during this year's Bathurst 1000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will break the nexus between tobacco and sport and between tobacco and cultural activities. There can hardly be a more bizarre association than that between a product which is known to be a killer and the health giving nature of sport. This is especially so in the Australian context where sport is a vital part of our culture and where elite sports people are idolised, particularly by the young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recognised that sporting bodies may need some time to find alternative sources of funding. Hence, the Bill will allow phasing out of advertising associated with sponsorship. The elite sports can be expected to find alternative commercial sponsors readily. The fact that a range of minor sports and small scale events, including in rural areas, will also need to seek support is a measure of the degree to which the tobacco dollar has penetrated sport and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government commends Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory governments for having established health promotion foundations to provide alternative funding and commends these examples to the other States and Territories. If, however, these smaller sports and events do genuinely find it impossible to replace lost tobacco funding, the Government will consider subsidising some events following the transition period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the effect of tobacco advertising, the Commonwealth has already banned direct advertising in the broadcast and print media. Several States and Territories have banned various other forms of advertising and marketing. In particular, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales have all introduced legislation to limit tobacco advertising. This State and Territory legislation also addresses other marketing activities by, for example, banning tobacco related competitions and free samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different regulations addressing tobacco advertising in each State and Territory have resulted in some difficulties with enforcement. For example, national activities have needed to be exempt and there have been ongoing problems with the venue for the 500cc motorcycle grand prix due to differences in the legislation between Victoria and New South Wales. Thus, a national advertising prohibition is required to ensure a comprehensive approach and one which minimises any disadvantage to a particular jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community is also increasingly introducing restrictions. Adoption of this Bill would move Australia from equal tenth to equal fifth in the OECD in terms of tobacco advertising restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community expects the Government to act. The Government announced in April that it would ban tobacco advertising. Recently there have been a number of calls for the promised legislation to be introduced. Recently this call was renewed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the principal medical advisory body to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will establish a complete ban on tobacco advertising to be phased in over the period 1 July 1993 to 31 December 1995. The major additional forms of tobacco advertising to be prohibited by this Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA>.advertising through sponsorship of sporting and cultural events&mdash;covering both naming of the event and publicity at the event;</PARA>
<PARA>.outdoor advertising such as on billboards or by illuminated signs; and</PARA>
<PARA>.the use of tobacco brand names, logos, et cetera on non-tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum penalty for breaching the ban is $12,000 for an individual or $60,000 for a corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill removes the potential for tobacco advertising but not to the extent that extreme measures are taken. </PARA>
<PARA>.Accidental or incidental advertising for which the broadcaster or publisher does not receive any benefit will be permitted. For example, broadcasts of tobacco sponsored sporting events held overseas will not be affected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>.International events to be held in Australia will be able to apply for an exemption from the ban. Such an exemption would be granted if the event has international significance and Australia would be likely to lose the event if the exemption was not provided. </PARA>
<PARA>.Point of sale advertising will not be eliminated. In those jurisdictions with point of sale legislation, the State or Territory rules will apply. In other jurisdictions, point of sale advertising&mdash;as defined by Commonwealth regulations&mdash;will be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA>.Also, tobacco advertising in imported periodicals will be exempt so that these publications may continue to be available in the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains sections which, if proclaimed, would permit the Minister to specify periodicals excluded from this permission. Should it appear that tobacco companies are exploiting this exemption, these sections will be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, in essence, prohibits the broadcast or publication of a tobacco advertisement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make racial vilification unlawful and also to make incitement to racial hatred a criminal offence. At the outset let me make it clear that the legislation is intended to show the Government's present intentions relating to this difficult area. The legislation is being introduced to allow for the widest possible public comment and discussion on the proposals. The Government does not have a finally established position on this Bill and I encourage all interested parties to provide comment on the legislation. To facilitate that comment the Bill will be left to lie in the Parliament over the summer recess. At present our intention would be that passage of the legislation would take place some time early in the next session of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will implement into Australian law the obligations contained in article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 4(a) requires states which are parties to the Convention to declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ratified the Convention on 30 September 1975 and made a reservation on article 4(a). Australia declared that it was the Government's intention, at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a). Over 125 states have ratified the Convention. One of the great focuses of human rights initiatives since 1945 has been on efforts to have the right to be free from invidious discrimination on grounds of race, gender or religious belief irreversibly accepted in the world. There have been significant advances in the campaign. The ending of the system of apartheid in South Africa, a political system built on racist theory, has been one of the major and profound steps along the road to the elimination of racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention has deeply influenced the domestic laws of most states which are parties to the Convention. It not only outlaws racist speech but also the practice of discrimination, among other things, in employment, housing, the provision of services and other fields. States, by virtue of article 2 of the Convention, are required to adopt a policy of positive action to eliminate racial discrimination, including measures which promote understanding among different racial groups and assist minorities in social, economic, cultural and other fields. The creation of a public opinion against racial discrimination is evidenced in the general acceptance of these norms, which limit the individual's contractual and property rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pervasive recognition that racially motivated violence and racial vilification are on the rise led the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conduct a national inquiry into racist violence. The inquiry opened in Sydney on 24 August 1989 and, during the next 12 months, held public hearings around Australia. The final report of the inquiry was published in 1991 and tabled in Parliament on 19 December 1991. The report concluded that racist violence, including intimidation and harassment, is an endemic problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in all Australian States. It found that racist attitudes and practices pervade Australian institutions, both private and public. Racist violence also occurs on the basis of ethnic identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concluded that the existence of a threatening environment is the most prevalent form of racist violence confronting people of non-English speaking backgrounds. They are subjected to racist intimidation and harassment because they are visibly different. In public places, racist violence usually takes the form of unprovoked one-off incidents by strangers; on the other hand, the level of racist violence on the basis of ethnic identity in Australia is nowhere near that in many other countries. Nevertheless, it exists at a level that causes concern and could increase in intensity and extent unless firmly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report made 67 recommendations directed to governments, police, public housing authorities, employer and employee organisations, education authorities, schools and higher education institutions and the media. The report recommended that civil remedies under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 should be extended to cover, for example, racial harassment. It also recommended that the Crimes Act 1914 should be amended to create two new Federal offences of racist violence and intimidation; and an offence of incitement to racist violence and racial hatred. On 19 December 1991, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) tabled the Government's response to the report. The Government supported most of the recommendations in principle. The Australian Law Reform Commission in its report No. 57 on multiculturalism and the law made similar recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that governments which have not already done so legislate to proscribe racial vilification and provide a conciliation mechanism for dealing with complaints of racial vilification. The penalties for racial vilification should not involve criminal sanctions. In addition to enabling individuals to lodge complaints, the legislation should empower organisations which can demonstrate a special interest in opposing racial vilification to complain on behalf of any individual or group represented by that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Law Reform Commission in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the law</EMPHASIS>, by majority, supported making racial vilification unlawful. The majority considered that making it a crime, however, restricts freedom of speech unduly. It was of the view that conciliation, backed up by civil remedies when conciliation fails, is the more appropriate way to deal with it and opposed the creation of a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to make it a criminal offence for a person publicly to utter or publish words or engage in conduct which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to stir up hatred against a person or group of persons distinguished by race, colour, national or ethnic origin. It also makes it an offence for a person to inspire fear by a group of persons that violence is about to be applied to them. The law is intended to cover racist statements or propaganda of a serious and damaging kind. Examples would include the leaflets placed in letter boxes by extremist organisations nominating certain races as plotting to overthrow the government or public speeches calling for the forcible repatriation of certain ethnic groups or for violence to be perpetrated against certain ethnic groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the Racial Discrimination Act to make it unlawful for a person to publicly utter or publish words or engage in conduct which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to stir up hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule against a person or persons or a group of persons, distinguished by race, colour, national or ethnic origin. There is a provision in the Bill that ensures that certain valid activities are not brought within its scope&mdash;that is, the publication or performance of bona fide works of art, genuine academic discussion of any matter of public interest, making or publishing a fair report of any event or matter of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be helpful to give an example of where it is envisaged that the dividing line between lawful and unlawful behaviour might fall. Republication in full of a nineteenth century book on Australia with some racist passages concerning Chinese and Aborigines but with an introduction placing the work in its historical context certainly would not be covered. On the other hand, publication of a pamphlet consisting exclusively of a selection of those same racist passages with an accompanying text advocating that all Chinese persons in Australia should be deported would be covered. By inserting these provisions into the Racial Discrimination Act, it makes it possible to retain the very considerable advantage of adopting existing conciliation procedures and increases the educative role of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of this legislation will say that the Government is seriously eroding the right to freedom of speech. Far from it. Australian defamation law has always recognised that words can seriously injure individuals and their social and economic well-being. Awareness of the damage which can be caused to individuals and groups through incitement to racial hatred or through racial vilification is only a recent development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proponents of the argument that freedom of expression is a value to be maintained at all costs would argue that the ethnic communities should bear the hurt of racial vilification until public education works its way through the ranks of society. However, the role of law as an educational force is often underestimated. The simple fact that an act is known to be unlawful will dissuade most citizens from performing that act unless they have a strong economic or personal interest in so doing. Laws can also change attitudes over time and it is not necessarily the case that an overall attitudinal change has to precede a change in the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important group upon whom the law can be expected to have a very rapid educational effect is persons in official positions whose employment is dependent upon their observance of the law. It should be emphasised that one quarter of all complaints of racist statements which have been lodged with the then Human Rights Commission were statements made by people in official positions. Many of these people will have been unthinking in their statements but understandably members of ethnic groups whom they attack have little expectation of equal treatment when they hear such remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument put forward by proponents of free speech is that the Government is introducing further censorship into Australia. It is worth repeating what the then Attorney-General, Senator Lionel Murphy, said about free speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free speech is only what is left after due weight has been accorded to the laws relating to defamation, blasphemy, copyright, sedition, obscenity, use of insulting words, official secrecy, contempt of court and of parliament, incitement and censorship . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, I could not have put it better myself. In my view, freedom of expression is just one of the values the law protects in a democratic society. In a tolerant society people are entitled to be protected against serious attempts to undermine tolerance by stirring up hatred between groups. Laws prohibiting incitement of racist hatred and hostility protect the inherent dignity of the human person. In a multicultural society, values such as equality of status, tolerance of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity and equal opportunity for everyone to participate in social processes must be respected and protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws prohibiting incitement to racist hatred and hostility indicate a commitment to tolerance, help prevent the harm caused by the spread of racism and foster harmonious social relations. Australia is a multicultural society. Its survival as a multicultural society demands that the communities that make up the Australian society live in peace and harmony. Inciting hatred and hostility against sections of the community is an affront to the whole community and the whole community has an interest in ensuring that it does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is of the view that no legislative action should be taken at this stage to make racist violence a Commonwealth crime but that existing State and Territory criminal law be relied upon. However, this matter has been left open and the Government invites further comment on this area as well. The Government is aware that certain sections of the community would like to see legislation on racist violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's current Bill does not cover abuse of, or incitement to hatred of, religious groups or individuals that are attacked on the grounds of their membership of such groups. This is essentially because the Bill concerns amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which is founded on the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This Convention does not cover religious discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that inciting religious hatred and vilification of religious groups should be unlawful but considers that the Racial Discrimination Act is not the appropriate place for such a provision. Australia fully supported the adoption of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. The Attorney-General will shortly be declaring that declaration to be an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purpose of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The Attorney has already consulted with the State and Territory Attorneys-General as required by that Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By declaring the religion declaration under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, Australia will demonstrate that it is firmly committed to its principles. The move is also consistent with the Government's response to the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence, which supported, subject to the consideration of constitutional issues, the amendment of the Racial Discrimination Act to provide that discrimination against or harassment of a person on account of that person's religious belief be prohibited where the religious belief is commonly associated with persons of a particular race or ethnic group. The effect of declaring an instrument under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act is to extend the promotion, research, inquiry and reporting functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the rights recognised in the instrument and to provide a mechanism for complaints to be lodged by persons claiming to have been discriminated against on the basis of their religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is of the view that, as the Bill covers vilification on the ground of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, it covers everybody. These four characteristics are broad enough to cover characteristics imputed to a person even if those characteristics are untrue. For instance, if an Anglo-Saxon woman who has converted to Islam is more than likely attacked wearing the hijab or Muslim women's headscarf, she is attacked not because the attacker believes she is a Muslim but because the attacker thinks that she is an Arab woman. This legislation would pick such instances up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For legislation prohibiting racial vilification to be of any long term benefit, it will be necessary for there to be an extensive public awareness and education campaign. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be funded to conduct such a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me again emphasise that the Government has introduced this legislation to encourage public discussion and debate on an issue which is relevant to us all. There needs to be balance struck between competing values that are central to our way of life. Where that balance is finally struck will depend very largely on the feedback the Government receives to this proposed legislation.

<PARA>The Cabinet Notebooks (Access and Protection) Bill 1992 amends a number of Acts regulating access to Commonwealth documents and their use in court proceedings. The Acts to be amended are the Archives Act 1983, the Evidence Act 1905 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The Bill will, for the first time, provide access under the Archives Act to documents recording the content of Cabinet discussions and clarify the status of these documents in court proceedings. Cabinet notebooks will be excluded from the operation of the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing with the current state of the law in relation to Cabinet notebooks, it may be helpful if I explain how the Cabinet note taking system works and the principles underlying the operation of the Cabinet system. Since 1951, a system has been in place to facilitate the formal recording of the outcome of Cabinet deliberations. It has developed at the behest of successive Prime Ministers solely to assist the Cabinet process by providing an effective link between the Government's private deliberations and the Public Service, which must give effect to the Government's decisions. The system allows Cabinet minutes&mdash;the formal record of Cabinet decisions&mdash;to be circulated to Ministers and departments as soon as possible for appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice is to have three note takers at Cabinet meetings who are officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, one of whom is the Secretary to the Cabinet. At least one of the note takers attempts to take as full a record as possible of discussions. The form of the notes is entirely within the discretion of each note taker. Entries in the notebooks, while not a complete verbatim account of proceedings in Cabinet, do record the gist of the contributions of individual Ministers. Such notes are, however, simply memory joggers to aid the drafting of the Cabinet minute. Cabinet minutes, on the other hand, are a record of the collective decision of Ministers on particular items and do not record the contributions of individual Ministers to discussion on those items.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the notes are not and do not purport to be a definitive record of proceedings, but merely a means to the end of preparing a definitive minute recording the collective decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notebooks are issued to note takers for their exclusive use and only the individual note taker, the Secretary to Cabinet or the officer in charge of the Cabinet Office has access to a notebook. On only one occasion has it been known for the contents of a notebook to have been shown to a person outside the Cabinet system, and this was with the express agreement of the Prime Minister in the context of the Hope Royal Commission of 1983, which examined issues concerning the actions of a Cabinet Minister. I might emphasise that neither Ministers nor the Prime Minister have direct access to Cabinet notebooks, although note takers have, at the request of the Minister concerned, referred to their notebooks for the purpose of assisting Ministers to recall their individual contributions to earlier discussions. I have detailed these arrangements to demonstrate the unique place of these notebooks in the Cabinet system and the importance of the note taking system to the efficient working of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cabinet system, as all members of the Parliament would be aware, was inherited from Westminster, and its successful operation depends upon the existence of certain conventions. One such convention is that of collective responsibility and solidarity with the concomitant obligations of confidentiality. The current <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>, which has evolved under successive governments, puts it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collective responsibility is supported by the strict confidentiality attaching to Cabinet documents and to discussions in the Cabinet room. Ministry, Cabinet and Cabinet committees are forums in which Ministers, while working towards a collective position, are able to discuss proposals and a variety of options and views with complete freedom.</PARA>
<PARA>The requirement that Cabinet proceedings be kept confidential is based on the vital practical consideration that the necessary frankness of discussion should not be inhibited. Whatever range of private views Ministers may put in Cabinet discussions, it is necessary that there be finality of decision making and that decisions, once arrived at and announced, are clear and unequivocal and supported by all Ministers. The frankness and freedom of expression in Cabinet proceedings would be seriously damaged if Cabinet confidentiality were not properly protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of access by the courts to Cabinet notebooks has been considered by the Federal Court and the Full Court of the Federal Court in the Northern Land Council v. Commonwealth of Australia and Energy Resources of Australia&mdash;the NLC case. The issue has been argued before the High Court and the parties are awaiting the Court's decision. Both the Federal Court and the Full Court of the Federal Court rejected the Commonwealth's argument that the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of Cabinet proceedings is such that Cabinet notebooks should be immune from production in court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to the views of the High Court&mdash;and it is not intended that this legislation apply to NLC notebooks should the High Court rule against the Commonwealth's public interest immunity argument&mdash;the present state of the common law would seem to be that, where the Commonwealth claims public interest immunity in response to an order to produce Cabinet notebooks, the question of whether they should be made available to courts for the purposes of litigation is ultimately one for the Court to determine, based on the Court's view about where the balance of the public interest lies in the particular case. The Government does not query the appropriateness of the common law position on public interest immunity so far as it relates to Cabinet material which does not disclose Cabinet debate, such as Cabinet minutes, memoranda and submissions. However, there are strong reasons of public policy in support of a different treatment for material which goes beyond recording outcomes and discloses the contributions of individual Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's concern is that the common law cannot provide what the Government believes is the degree of confidentiality essential if the present Cabinet system is to continue. The release of notebooks would destroy the expectation on the part of Ministers that the expression of their views would remain confidential. More importantly, the freedom that Ministers feel to debate matters in complete privacy in the future would be seriously eroded, which could only harm the efficacy of the decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Government believes that the alternative of doing away with the current note taking system would be detrimental to the efficient operation of the Cabinet system. Indeed, it may not be a practical alternative at all, especially in an era of a large volume of Cabinet business on issues often of great complexity. The complete exclusion of officials as observers or a ban on their keeping any notes would be required, thus removing the very basis for accurate preparation of Cabinet decisions following discussions. Moreover, doing away with the system could not protect the notebooks already in existence. The Government is not prepared to destroy those records, which in due course would be of great interest to historians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore decided to amend the Evidence Act 1905 to protect the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions by prohibiting the disclosure to courts of the notebooks and any other notes taken by officials present in the Cabinet room during Cabinet discussions and of oral evidence of officials about those discussions. I should emphasise that the common law of public interest immunity as it applies to the admission of Cabinet material other than these notes, such as minutes&mdash;that is, final decisions&mdash;and submissions, will not be affected by the proposed amendments. Use of this material in legal proceedings will remain a matter for the courts to determine, taking into account the sensitivities of the particular material and its relevance to the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the present law so far as it relates to evidence given by Ministers about Cabinet discussions will not be affected. Subject to the right of the Commonwealth to make a claim of public interest immunity in relation to particular evidence to be given by Ministers, they will not be prevented from giving evidence based on their recollections of discussions. It will remain a matter for the courts to determine whether the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the evidence be given by a Minister in a particular case. The alternative option of providing a statutory discretion to allow or prohibit Ministers giving evidence was considered, but the Government concluded that this would place governments in an invidious position of appearing to make political decisions in individual cases about whether or not particular evidence could be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I reiterate that the proposed provisions will not cover the notebooks, the subject of court action in the NLC case. Whatever the decision of the High Court and any subsequent consideration by the Federal Court on the issue, the Government will abide by the Court's decision. The Government believes that there are important reasons to protect the notebooks for as long as their use in court could have a detrimental effect on the Cabinet system. However, the Government has accepted that there comes a time when notebooks could only be of historical interest, and for this reason has decided to remove the provision of the Archives Act which excludes Cabinet notebooks from the operation of that Act. The Government has made the judgment that the period of 50 years will be sufficient to ensure that any sensitivities arising from the nature of the notebooks will have receded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nature of notebooks themselves as but individual and often incomplete interpretations of Cabinet discussions, they are an imperfect record and their use by historians in the future would no doubt reflect that fact. Even so, they may well provide insights into government decision making and be, to historians, a useful adjunct to Cabinet decisions which are now released after 30 years. The Government has decided that the informal records of the meeting of the War Cabinet during the World War II period will be released as soon as possible. These notebooks may well provide historians with a fascinating insight into government decision making during that period and convey a unique sense of the urgency of the crisis facing Australia at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is intended to remove the uncertainty surrounding the status of Cabinet notebooks and the Cabinet note taking system. The Government believes that the proposed amendments reflect a realistic consideration of the public interest in the administration of justice and the rights of individuals and the public interest in ensuring that the operation of the Cabinet system is not impeded, together with&mdash;for the first time&mdash;a clear and sensible archival mechanism for handling these documents. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1992 is to make changes to the Copyright Act 1968 in three important areas and to correct a technical problem which has arisen from the operation of previous amendments to the Act. Because of the intense interest in the changes to copyright in sound recordings that were decided on by the Government and which are implemented by this Bill, I propose that the Bill lie on the table for three months to allow sufficient time for comments to be made and considered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first important change arises from the Government's response to the Prices Surveillance Authority's 1990 report on the prices of sound recordings. The most significant of the reforms the Government has decided to make following its consideration of the report is to permit the unrestricted commercial importation of non-pirate copies of foreign records appearing in the market after 1 July 1994. Other important reforms are designed to address the concern of sound recording copyright owners that the unrestricted importation of records may result in an influx of pirate records into Australia and affect their income from the sale of legitimate records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill will introduce changes to prevent copyright in product packaging and labelling being used by distributors to create exclusive markets in relation to products. Such use of copyright in a label or package is an incidental and unintended use of copyright laws and has the potential effect of denying consumers access to goods at lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final major change to be made by this Bill will be to remove the automatic right of a copyright owner, once a court has found in an action for infringement of copyright that an infringement has occurred, to damages amounting to the full value of the articles when sold by the defendant, even when the infringement relates to only part of the article. This remedy is known as conversion damages. I will now address each of these reforms in detail. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government's Response to the PSA Report on Record Prices</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Copyright Act, the owners of the copyright in a sound recording and any musical works performed in the recording can prevent the importation into Australia for commercial purposes of copies of that sound recording without their permission. The copyright owners can also prevent the sale of, and other commercial dealings with, copies so imported. For a number of years, there have been complaints from record sellers and consumer groups, among others, that this control by copyright owners has restricted record availability and inflated prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 this issue was referred by the Government to the Copyright Law Review Committee for examination. The CLRC reported in September 1988 and recommended that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act be relaxed so as to improve availability of foreign sound recordings. However, in making its recommendations, the CLRC made the comment that, in effect, there was insufficient evidence before it to determine the question of the effect of the present legislation on the prices of sound recordings in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the question of record prices was referred to the PSA for consideration. As honourable members will be aware, amendments to the Copyright Act are now in place relaxing the importation provisions as they apply to books. In relation to records, the PSA reported its findings to the Minister for Consumer Affairs in December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA found that the prices of sound recordings&mdash;that is, cassettes, CDs and LPs&mdash;were higher in Australia than in North America, Western Europe and even New Zealand. In the PSA's view, three factors underpinned these higher prices. Firstly, the demand for records was relatively inelastic compared with that for other products. Secondly, domestic price competition appeared to be absent. Thirdly, the importation provisions of the Copyright Act tended to restrict import competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the PSA recommended that the importation provisions of the Act be repealed in relation to parallel  imports of records&mdash;that is, records made with the licence of the copyright owner&mdash;from countries providing levels of protection for musical works and sound recordings comparable to those in Australia. However, the PSA recognised that the Australian  music industry operates on an established contractual framework which reflects the rights which copyright owners presently enjoy under the Act. Therefore, it also recommended that implementation of its recommendations be delayed for 12 months to allow the industry to  readjust  to  the  proposed  new  legal regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced earlier this year, the Government has decided to make a number of changes to the Copyright Act following the PSA's report. From 1 July 1994, the Australian market will be opened up to parallel imports from the United States, certain member countries of the EC, notably the UK, and New Zealand. These countries, which were identified as having lower record prices than Australia, presently provide adequate protection against record piracy. They will be included in a schedule to the Copyright Act, to which further countries may be added as appropriate. While these countries are few in number, they include the main sources of imported records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the release of the PSA's report, extensive consultations were held by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) with all sectors of the music industry. It became apparent from submissions made on the PSA's report by music interests that adoption of its recommendations in full could have some adverse consequences for Australian performers whose works are marketed internationally. They expressed concern at the possibility of unfair competition for sales of their records from imported records which have been deleted from the catalogue of the overseas manufacturer of those imports and could be sold here at lower prices. In the US, for example, no copyright royalties are payable on deletions, nor are any contractual royalties payable to the recording artist. Although this is generally recognised to be a problem likely to affect only a very small percentage of the market, the potential damage to sales in individual cases may be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian performers were concerned that overseas deletions of their locally released recordings would be imported and sold in Australia, thereby depriving them of the capacity to fully recoup the investment made to put their records on the Australian market. Accordingly, the Government has decided to take these concerns into account under the proposed reforms. Both the owner of copyright in the underlying musical work and the owner of copyright in the sound recording are to retain the right to control the importation of records where the recording is of a performer who is an Australian citizen or resident. In the case of recording by a group of performers, that control will apply if the majority of the featured artists are Australian citizens or residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mechanism is consistent with Australia's obligations under the Berne Copyright Convention and the Rome Neighbouring Rights Convention because it does not discriminate on the basis of nationality amongst either musical composers or record producers as such. The right to control importation of recordings of Australian performers is to apply regardless of whether they were made in Australia or elsewhere. Thus, importers will only be able to freely import recordings of foreign performers from the countries included in the proposed schedule to the Copyright Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Aside from these far-reaching proposals, this Bill will also introduce other reforms which will have a significant impact on, and provide benefits for, both the music industry and consumers:</PARA>
<PARA>.The amendments will provide a better legal framework within which individual customer orders for records may be met quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>.The changes will ensure that, as from 1 July 1994, back catalogue imported sound recordings are available to consumers within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA>.Copyright owner initiated customs seizure of infringing copyright articles under section 135 of the Act will be extended to include infringing copies of sound recordings. This will enhance the ability of copyright owners to control the importation of pirate products. </PARA>
<PARA>.For the benefit of copyright owners, the penalties for sound recording piracy offences will be brought into line with those applying to film piracy. </PARA>
<PARA>.The burden of proof in civil sound recording piracy proceedings, in relation to the subsistence and ownership of copyright, will be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant where the plaintiff's claim of subsistence and ownership is established with appropriate evidentiary formality. This will facilitate infringement actions taken by copyright owners. </PARA>
<PARA>.Moreover, the knowledge requirement in civil actions under sections 37 and 102 of the Act for copyright infringement by importation of pirate articles will be removed, thus bringing such proceedings into line with those for locally made pirate articles. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that the changes being introduced by this Bill to the sound recording importation provisions of the Copyright Act provide a sensible, fair and workable balance of competing interests. They will have the effect of providing greater protection for copyright owners in a number of important areas while, at the same time, ensuring greater accessibility to and price competitiveness of imported records for the benefit of Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Product Packaging and Labelling</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Importation into, and distribution in, Australia of a variety of goods has been effectively controlled and exclusively licensed by manufacturers by relying on ownership of the copyright in the labelling or packaging of the goods. As with sound recordings, owners of copyright in works reproduced in product labelling and packaging can prevent importation of those materials without their permission. This has prevented importers from gaining and passing on to consumers the benefit of cheaper prices for the goods from alternative overseas suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For example, in the 1986 case of Bailey v. Boccacio, the defendant imported for sale in Australia bottles of Bailey's Irish cream otherwise than through the Australian distributor appointed by the manufacturer of the product and, as a result, at a lower cost. At the suit of the manufacturer, the New South Wales Supreme Court held that the importation infringed the copyright held by the manufacturer in the picture on the bottle label. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CLRC in its 1988 report on the importation provisions of the Act criticised this use of copyright where the package or label in which the copyright subsisted was only an incidental part of the goods. The CLRC recommended changes to the law to restrict such control by a copyright owner to articles which are truly copyright articles, for example, books and films. Subsequently, complaints were made that copyright in instruction manuals and warrants accompanying goods has also been used to prevent parallel importation of  goods  in  the  same way  as  copyright  in  packaging  and labelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CLRC observed that the design of packages and labels to make them subject to copyright is a common practice in many industries such as those relating to liquor, tobacco, perfumes and cosmetic products. It was strongly of the opinion that distributors of imported goods should not be able to control the market in Australia by the simple expedient of enclosing them in a copyright label or package. Usually, buyers of such goods are primarily interested in the goods themselves, and the packaging or labelling is of no interest or only of incidental interest. The Government believes that the use of a copyright owner's exclusive importation rights over packaging or labelling to protect exclusive distribution arrangements for goods is an unintended use of copyright and is anti-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A change to the law to end this copyright control has attracted some criticism from those industries which rely on it to control the marketing of their goods in Australia. However, the Government regards it as indefensible to use copyright in this incidental way to deny consumers the possibility of lower prices and better access to goods. The amendments being introduced by the Bill in this area will remove the right to control the importation of products through the exercise of copyright in packaging or labelling associated with the products, where use of the copyright with the products was agreed to by the copyright owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The recently passed Copyright Amendment Act 1991 has allowed books to be parallel imported, without the copyright owner's licence, in certain circumstances. Occasionally, some books, such as a set of volumes by the same author, are sold in a container. To prevent any copyright in the container being used to frustrate the reforms made by the Act, the changes which the Government proposes by the present Bill will extend to containers in which copyright goods are sold and which are merely incidental to those goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Copyright instruction manuals, warranties, audio cassettes or videos that accompany goods are normally only incidental to goods to which they relate. Copyright in such explanatory or warranty material should similarly not be able to be used to control the importation of those goods and the current Bill will also end such control. The changes that are being introduced will not, however, extend to instruction manuals that accompany computer software. Those manuals were excluded from the reforms in the Copyright Amendment Act 1991 because all aspects of intellectual property protection of computer software are currently being examined by the CLRC, which is expected to issue a draft report soon. It would be inappropriate to change existing copyright rules in relation to software manuals pending the CLRC's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the changes being introduced will not extend to copyright in, for example, pictures or patterns that are a permanent part of the goods themselves, for instance, cooking pots. In that case, the picture or design may be a reason for its selection by the purchaser, and thus may not be incidental like packaging or labelling. I must emphasise too that the reforms in this area will not affect a manufacturer's rights to control the distribution of goods through other avenues such as causes of action for passing off, breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and trademark infringements under the Trade Marks Act 1955. These remedies are based on different policy considerations to copyright and will not be altered by the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Government recognises that the reforms in this area, if introduced to apply immediately, may affect a manufacturer's or distributor's existing licensing arrangements in relation to products. With this in mind, the changes to product packaging and labelling will not commence until 1 July 1993. This will afford an opportunity for commercial adjustments to be made to take account of the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reform of Conversion Damages Remedy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Copyright Act presently provides that, where deliberate copyright infringement is established, the copyright owner has an automatic right to conversion damages, that is, damages amounting to the value of the infringing articles at the time of their disposal by the defendant. The remedy also extends to the delivery up of any infringing articles still held by the defendant. Both those remedies apply even if the infringement relates to only part of the article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two remedies were the subject of the CLRC's 1990 report on conversion damages which recommended changes to the Act to make the remedies available only at the discretion of the court, so as to avoid possible abuse by copyright owners and unfairness to defendants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main concern with regard to the remedy of conversion damages is the harshness with which it can operate. An extreme example is the 1981 case of W.H. Brine &amp; Co. v. Whitton where the defendant was ordered to pay damages amounting to the whole value of imported soccer balls even though the copyright infringement related only to an emblem printed on the surface of the balls. Also, a plaintiff's alternative right to take possession of any infringing copies in the defendant's possession can provide a windfall gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CLRC considered the position in other countries with similar legal systems to Australia's. The United Kingdom has abolished the remedy of conversion damages, although copyright owners may still be entitled to delivery up of any infringing copies in the defendant's possession in certain circumstances. Conversion damages and actions for detention are not available in the United States. Both countries are major exporters of copyright articles to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some cases where the award of conversion damages and the delivery up of infringing goods are merited, bearing in mind that conversion damages are available only in cases of knowing infringement. For instance, in the case of pirate copies of sound recordings and films, the plaintiff should be able to recover the value of the copies disposed of or, if the defendant still has them, to obtain their delivery up together with the copying equipment used to make them. However, these remedies should be available only at the court's discretion, exercisable according to appropriate criteria which the present Bill sets out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes being introduced by the Bill may be opposed by some film and video interests who see the automatic right to conversion damages as having an important deterrent effect against piracy. However, the Government believes the amendments will provide for the fairer administration of justice, without depriving the courts of strong remedies for infringement of copyright where they are warranted, including relief in the form of damages which the courts may grant under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the Government will leave the Bill on the table for three months to allow adequate opportunity for consideration, the making of any comments to the Government and consideration of those comments by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments effected by this Bill have no direct impact on Commonwealth expenditure.

<PARA>The purpose of the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1992 is to give effect to the National Road Transport Commission's first determination regarding annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and permit charges for vehicles operating above 125 tonnes. The Bill is vital to the Government's national micro-economic reform agenda for land transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long the efficiency of Australia's interstate road transport operations has been impeded by a lack of uniformity in regulations and charging. Currently heavy vehicle operating conditions and registration charges vary considerably between nine different jurisdictions and bear little relation to the costs imposed on the road system by various types of vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC, which is an independent statutory authority, was established as a result of the heads of government agreement of July 1991 and set up under Commonwealth legislation passed in December 1991. Its purpose is to investigate and make recommendations regarding the establishment of a national registration scheme and uniform road use charges for heavy vehicles, and nationally consistent operating regulations for all vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intergovernmental agreement, which forms a schedule to the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, requires the NRTC to recommend charges for heavy vehicles which: achieve full cost recovery; achieve a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity; improve the link between pricing and investment decisions; and minimise the incentive for road transport operators to shop around for lower charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial council approved the NRTC charging determination on behalf of State and Territory governments. It is envisaged that each of the States and the Northern Territory will pass legislation in their respective parliaments which will adopt the legislation passed in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and any regulations made under it. This will ensure that there is uniform charging for heavy vehicles throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the intergovernmental agreement, this Bill will require the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, from 1 July 1995 onwards, to fix annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and to fix charges for the granting of permits to operate vehicles with a gross mass exceeding 125 tonnes. Those charges will be fixed in accordance with the schedule to the Bill. The Bill will not affect the existing registration scheme in the Australian Capital Territory other than to fix the charges to be collected when a heavy vehicle is registered. Responsibility for determining registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the Australian Capital Territory. Revenue from the registration charges will be retained by the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charges provided for in the schedule to the Bill may be increased or decreased by regulations under the proposed Act. The amount of increase or decrease is limited to a maximum of 5 per cent per annum. Heads of government have agreed that the matter of concessional registration charges for particular groups is for each State and Territory to address according to their own priorities, with the cost to revenue being met from their own budgets. In accordance with this decision, the NRTC charging determination does not make recommendations on the level and structure of concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the process of implementing national charges, the States and Territories will be reviewing the structure of registration concessions in their individual jurisdictions, including those which apply to the rural sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it would be contrary to the spirit of the intergovernmental agreement for governments to impose administration or inspection fees that varied greatly across jurisdictions, as road transport operators would see these as part of the total cost of registering a vehicle. This would encourage operators to shop around between the States and Territories. A working group of officials is examining the issue of acceptable and uniform levels of administrative charges and inspection fees and is expected to complete its report by April 1993. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes an amendment to the existing law to provide specifically for the assessability and deductibility of payments made in respect of accrued leave entitlements by one employer to another at the time an employee transfers to a new employer. This measure will operate where payments made are to facilitate the transfer of the employee pursuant to, or to accommodate the implementation of, an industrial award. Such payments will be called accrued leave transfer payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the taxation of capital gains and losses. The Bill also contains measures to synchronise the capital gains tax and plant depreciation treatment of terminations of Crown leases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several technical amendments are to be made to various capital allowance provisions and to anti-avoidance rules relating to those provisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act proposed by the Bill relate to dividend streaming arrangements, PAYE, and the gift provisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, employees accrue leave entitlements based only on the period of employment with their current employer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those industries, leave entitlements under the terms of an industrial agreement or award may be based on total service with a number of employers. Accordingly, employers may be required, or may as a matter of commercial reality decide, to pay one another on account of a transferring employee's accrued leave entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing law, an employer is not entitled to a deduction for a payment made in respect of leave entitlements that have accrued to an employee during the course of his or her employment with that employer unless it is made directly to the employee or, if the employee is dead, to a dependant or personal representative of the employee. Consequently, if a payment in respect of an employee's accrued leave entitlements is made by one employer to another upon the transfer of the employee, no tax deduction is available to the employer who makes the payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will allow the employer who makes the payment to claim a deduction for the amount of that payment.

The first amendment relates to the broad banding of depreciation rates for plant acquired before 27 February 1992. The amendment will make it clear that rates of depreciation determined on effective life that match a broad banded rate cannot be increased to the next highest broad banded rate. The amendment will apply from the same time as the broad banding measures;  that is, in relation to the 1991-92 and subsequent years of income. The second will amend the plant depreciation crown lease provisions in relation to disposals of pre-27 February 1992 plant, for which deductions have been allowed under the prime cost method, to prevent balancing loss deductions for that portion of the cost of plant notionally depreciated before 27 February 1992. It will also ensure that tax is imposed on the recoupment of previously allowed deductions. The amendment will apply to disposals occurring after 26 February 1992, the date from which the crown lease provisions applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third amendment will replace an existing option taxpayers have to adopt annually a lesser rate of depreciation for an asset with a once-only option to adopt a lesser rate of depreciation that is not less than that based on effective life. This new option rule will apply in relation to current and subsequent years of income. Next, to correct an oversight, the petroleum mining roll-over relief provisions are to be amended so that they apply, as appropriate, to pre-18 September 1974 expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment in this series relates to anti-avoidance rules applicable to arrangements involving the use of property by tax-exempt bodies and the like. The amendment will make it certain that those rules can apply to arrangements where a person is entitled to deductions under a capital allowance provision in relation to property which he does not own.

<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992, which was introduced into this House on 4 November, implemented many of the measures outlined in the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement,</EMPHASIS> of 30 June 1992. Those measures introduce changes to both the voluntary and compulsory tiers of the Government's superannuation policies: changes which are designed to make the Government's policies fairer, simpler and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill now before us will introduce two of the remaining measures outlined in that statement: the treatment of death benefits and excessive components. The Bill also gives effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 4 September 1992 relating to the tax exemption available to continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds, ADFs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments contained in the Bill change the notice requirements relating to personal superannuation contributions and allow ADFs to provide pensions. Lastly, the Bill will make a minor technical amendment to the reasonable benefit limit reporting requirements. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Death Benefits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces amendments to assess lump sum superannuation benefits received by a person, on the death of another person, against the deceased's pension reasonable benefit limits. The purpose of these amendments is to reduce the scope for estate planning and to ensure the retirement plans of non-dependants are not disrupted by a bequest of a superannuation benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also changes the taxation treatment of death benefit eligible termination payments. Under the current arrangements the tax treatment of a death benefit varies considerably, depending upon the source of the benefit and whether it is received direct or through the deceased's estate. The new arrangements are both simpler and more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a death benefit ETP is within the deceased's pension RBL and is paid to a dependant of the deceased the benefit will be exempt from tax. If the benefit is paid to a non-dependant the ETP will be broken into its ordinary components. However, the post-June 1983 component of the benefit will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent plus Medicare levy if paid from a taxed source and 30 per cent plus medicare levy if paid from an untaxed source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Benefits in excess of the deceased's RBL entitlement will be taxed as an excessive component of an ETP whether paid to a dependant or a non-dependant of the deceased. These measures will apply from 1 July 1994 and are not expected to have any revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Excessive Component</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, under the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, the excessive component of an ETP is taxed at the taxpayer's marginal rates of tax. In line with the Treasurer's statement, the Bill will amend that Act to ensure that the excessive component of an ETP, that is, the amount in excess of the RBL, is taxed at the top marginal rate of tax, currently 47 per cent, plus Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will apply from 1 July 1994. This measure, combined with the measures relating to limits on deductions for superannuation contributions and RBLs, is expected to increase revenue by $20m in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Notice Requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will amend the notice requirements relating to the tax treatment of personal superannuation contributions. Under the existing arrangements superannuation funds must treat all personal superannuation contributions as taxable contributions unless they are notified that a member is not going to claim a tax deduction for their contribution. As most personal superannuation contributions do not qualify for a deduction, the Bill proposes that personal superannuation contributions will not be treated as taxable contributions by a superannuation fund unless the fund has received a notice from the member stating that he is intending to claim a deduction for his contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, taxpayers will be eligible for a deduction for personal superannuation contributions to a complying superannuation fund only if they give a notice to the fund advising the fund that they are intending to claim a tax deduction for their contributions and receive an acknowledgment of the notice from the fund. These new arrangements have been actively sought by the superannuation industry because they substantially reduce the administrative burden on superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will apply to contributions made to a fund on or after 1 July 1992, other than contributions made by a person who has ceased to be a member of the fund before the date of royal assent. These measures are not expected to have any revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Continuously Complying Fixed Interest ADFs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make a technical amendment in relation to continuously complying fixed interest ADFs. Continuously complying fixed interest ADFs are exempt from tax on income that is referable to certain deposits held in ADFs as at 25 May 1988 when the tax arrangements applying to superannuation funds and ADFs were announced. The exemption applies only if an ADF receives at least 90 per cent of its investment income as interest or from amounts received in respect of the disposal of long term securities. Given that the disposal of securities is a normal activity of these investment bodies, the Bill will allow  ADFs to take into account profits on the disposal of securities to determine whether they qualify as continuously complying fixed interest ADFs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will apply from 1 July 1988 as it is broadly consistent with the original policy intention of exempting continuously complying fixed interest ADFs. The measure is not expected to have any revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Provision of Pensions by ADFs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 to allow ADFs to provide allocated pensions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment ADFs act as repositories of ETP moneys and can only pay out lump sums. Depositors may not retain such moneys in an ADF after the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing ADFs to provided allocated pensions will enable ADF depositors to have the option of drawing down their accounts in the form of a pension benefit subject to the controls that will apply to allocated pensions generally, such as minimum and maximum payment rules. Pension payments will be subject to beneficiaries meeting tests similar to those applying to superannuation funds, for example, retirement. The measure will increase the choice available to people as to their pension providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a number of technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to recognise that ADFs can pay pensions. The measure will apply from 1 July 1994 and is not expected to have any revenue implications. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reasonable Benefit Limit Reporting Requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the Bill makes a minor amendment to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act in relation to the reasonable benefit limit reporting requirements so that the exemption from reporting ETPs of small value is extended to all payers of ETPs, other than ADFs and deferred annuity funds. This measure applies from 24 December 1991. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth recalling that these amendments came about because of the initiative taken by the Opposition to oblige the Government to refer the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1992 to a committee of the Senate. That committee duly met and made certain proposals to the Government, most of which, I gather, it has agreed to, and are in the form of the amendment now before the Committee. I should point out, however, that I believe there was a late change whilst the legislation was in the Senate due to a matter which had not been brought to the attention of the committee sooner. There is also a matter to do with the provision relating to corporate clothing and occupational clothing, although that is not in the category that I mentioned in my opening remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is just another example of it. They do not insist that the promised simplicity of taxation legislation is pursued.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments are pretty much in the same category as the amendments to an earlier Bill. It should not have been necessary for the Government to refer them back to the Senate; it could have dealt with them on the way through the House of Representatives. It is further evidence of what I term its hairy-chested approach to taxation legislation. It borders on the crash or crash through mentality. That is manifested in a fairly regular way by action simply to get the legislation through the House of Representatives as quickly as possible, in the hope that there is nothing wrong with it, and in the process avoid scrutiny by the House, either during second reading debates or in the Committee of the Whole, such as we have now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We are arguing that Senate amendment No. 1 is not acceptable because many of the benefits provided by the institutions mentioned in this amendment are exempt from fringe benefits tax. For example, benefits provided to religious practitioners in respect of their pastoral duties, benefits provided to employees of public benevolent institutions, live-in accommodation of and food benefits provided to employees of government, religious and non-profit organisations who care for elderly and disadvantaged persons, and live-in accommodation with food benefits provided to domestic workers employed by religious institutions or religious practitioners are exempt benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, there is no reason in equity why those institutions mentioned in the amendment which are subject to fringe benefits tax should not pay fringe benefits tax on car parking benefits. The use of the term `educational institution' rather than `public educational institution' grants the exemption to profit making organisations who pay both income tax and fringe benefits tax. Finally, while the words `scientific, religious, charitable or educational' have a developed interpretation in the context of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, a different meaning may be given to these words under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition proposed the amendment in the Senate and, naturally, we will pursue it. If I understood the reasons of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) in opposing this amendment, they were in part that those bodies which would be affected by our amendment already have exemption from the fringe benefits tax. Presumably, that means that they will not be affected anyway if that is the case. I am not clear on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, one could use the same argument for saying, `Why bother to knock back the amendment if it is not to have any effect in that context?'. I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary went on to give some other reasons, but if I heard him correctly, on behalf of the coalition, I simply do not accept the first part of his reasoning. We have before us a matter referred to in the Budget in virtually one sentence. The Budget reference to this legislation and the Government's intention to legislate in this way reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the continuing task of making the tax system fairer, from 1 April 1993, Fringe Benefits Tax will be applied to valuable car parking facilities&mdash;mainly in central business districts&mdash;that are provided by employers to their employees.</PARA>
<PARA>So there was not a wealth of information contained in the Budget. Perhaps that is understandable; I am not being critical of that. What we do have subsequently is an indication of the financial impact of the proposal. It was said that these measures would raise $90m in 1993-94; $240m in 1994-95&mdash;although I understand that that is no longer the case and that the Government expects less than that, due to the grossing-up effect, as I understand it&mdash;and $190m in 1995-96, according to the information provided by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government has subsequently changed its estimates, it is still wildly underestimating, as far as we can tell. We can judge that by the fact that two companies alone will have to bear about $20m under these arrangements. This is another significant tax on business, another little impost which will probably see our position in the list of OECD countries with high business tax go up from fourth out of 23 into the first three. If this Government stays in office much longer, we will be top of the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition set out, through the assiduous work of my colleague Senator Watson, to exclude educational institutions, amongst others, from the provisions of this Bill. Surely, people cannot find much wrong with that. In equity, we were trying to reduce the cost of education in this country. At present the Bill is worded in an all-embracing way to include educational institutions quite deliberately. For instance, we have the case of the University of Melbourne which will have to fork out under these provisions, as I understand it, but would not have to if the Government had been sensible enough to accept our amendment. Incidentally, the Government has recognised that its estimates of revenue to be gathered from these measures are wildly out. I believe that was confessed to in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But getting back to educational institutions and adding religious, charitable and other such bodies to the list, this seems to us to be consistent with some tax law in this country already. Therefore, it is perfectly logical to extend it in this case. Indeed, the definitions for those categories which we believe should be included and which are enumerated in our amendment are already defined in various taxation Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that this Bill, as amended&mdash;plus the proposed Government amendment which we will not be opposing&mdash;but without our amendment, will still be a very dicey piece of tax law. There are very strong reasons to believe that the Bill will tax more than fringe benefits. This would be brought about by arbitrary devices, such as the one-kilometre rule or the four-hour rule, because they remain the basis for determining whether the fringe benefit tax liability exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, the Bill remains inconsistent with the treatment of other fringe benefits. The Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia has some very strong concerns about and objections to the provisions in this legislation. It would prefer to see the Bill subjected to a technical review and there is some merit in what it seeks to achieve by doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it seems that the Government is hell-bent on pressing ahead and, once again, increasing business taxes in this country to the detriment of not only profitability but also employability. This tax will increase the host of businesses and operations which are now being driven offshore. There is good reason to believe that our total tax burden contributes to that situation, but this Bill, as amended, will certainly add to it once again. </PARA>

If it is a benefit taken in kind instead of cash, why should they not pay a tax on that? I have not heard an argument in this place tonight why they should not. The point I was making before holds true: where fringe benefits are taken as a benefit instead of a payment in cash, those benefits should be taxed, and particularly in this case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill is supported by the coalition. The only complaint we have about this Bill is that it has taken such a long time to reach fruition. We were given indications that it would have been presented to this House something like 18 months ago. It has taken a long time to reach this state because of the wheelings and dealings inside the Labor Party. Nonetheless, it is a Bill which is appropriate and long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) will be well aware that I asked him for the Bill something like 18 months ago. I asked him for support; I asked him for indications; I asked him for briefings. He was unable or unwilling to provide any of those things. There was no sense of bipartisan approach to the Bill, which is a vital health issue. The Minister can smugly smile about the whole thing. Clearly he does not care about the fact that this Bill is going to save lives; he cares only about his internal party politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few points here which are vitally important. The first issue to assess is whether in fact there is a health issue involved in smoking. I think this is now beyond all doubt. The second is whether advertising, in whatever form, actually increases the likelihood of people, particularly the young, taking up smoking. The third issue is whether there are any reasons why we should not put this Bill through. One of the important things to note is that this Bill closes a loophole in the original prohibition of broadcasting of tobacco advertising legislation, which was brought in by the Fraser Government&mdash;a Liberal Government&mdash;in, I believe, 1976. I am delighted that the loopholes are now being closed because they have been ruthlessly exploited by a number of tobacco companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the first issue: is tobacco smoking harmful? I think there is no doubt about it. It is the largest single preventable cause of disease in Australia today. It is estimated to have caused between 19,000 and 20,000 deaths in Australia in the last year. Seventy-five per cent of drug caused deaths are due to tobacco&mdash;not, as other people would indicate, opiates. Opiates probably cause something like 2 or 3 per cent of deaths; 20 or 25 per cent are due to alcohol, including road crashes. Something like a third of all cancer deaths in Australia are attributable to smoking. Between one in five and one in three smokers will die of a tobacco caused illness, depending on how heavily they smoke. A person who smokes roughly one packet of cigarettes a day increases his or her chances of getting lung cancer by about eight times; with two packets it goes up to 25 times. There is no doubt at all about the association between tobacco smoking and a number of diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the people who smoke who are affected; passive smoking clearly also has adverse health effects for adults, but more importantly perhaps for children. It is the cause of lung cancer and heart disease in adult non-smokers&mdash;unequivocally. One of the questions which this Bill has to address is whether there has been encouragement to the youth in our society to smoke. The main development period for the uptake of smoking is usually between the ages of 12 and 16. Sadly, in those age groups there is a particular prevalence of smoking amongst girls rather than boys. Advertising by tobacco companies in its various forms, including sponsorship of sporting and cultural events, has undoubtedly been a factor in encouraging the uptake of smoking, particularly by these young people. Again I think the evidence for that is overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one asks the children themselves they will say just that. Something like 65 per cent of children aged 10 and 11 indicate that tobacco sponsorship is simply another form of advertising. So, contrary to what various tobacco authorities tell us, there is good evidence that tobacco sponsorship is simply advertising. There is good evidence about market share. One of the arguments sometimes put forward by tobacco companies is that all they are doing is changing brands, rather than increasing smoking per se. In fact, tobacco advertising of any sort does both. It not only moves people into a company's own brand but also encourages individuals to take up smoking&mdash;particularly when it is associated with clean, healthy activities such as the various sports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt at all that children see sponsorship of sports as equivalent to a personal endorsement of smoking by the athletes and other players involved in those sports. According to the AMA study in 1991, 61 per cent of Western Australian teenagers believed that the sponsorship of cricket by Benson and Hedges would encourage children to smoke. There is evidence from around the world that this is the case. There is good evidence about the impact of smoking. Some cigarette companies say that it really does not have a major impact. The simple answer to that is: if that is the case, why do they spend millions of dollars on it? Beyond that, there is good evidence about the brands. For example, why is it that far more children in New South Wales and Queensland smoke Winfield than in other States&mdash;something like 44.5 per cent in New South Wales and 48 per cent in Queensland compared with 4 or 5 per cent in South Australia and 18 or 19 per cent in Victoria? There is good evidence that in New South Wales and Queensland, where Winfield achieves enormous visibility by sponsoring the major winter sport, rugby league, that is the underlying reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Escort dominated the young adolescent market in South Australia, and Escort sponsored the Australian rules Escort Cup. In Victoria, Peter Jackson dominated, followed by Winfield, and, although there is not such an overwhelming predominance of Peter Jackson advertisements, that brand is heavily advertised through the AFL. There is no doubt at all about the impact of smoking upon the young. Those age groups related to smokers between the ages of 12 and 14. We are talking about young school children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There really is, I think, no doubt, first of all, that tobacco is harmful and, secondly, that advertising increases the likelihood of taking up smoking and does impact upon the brand. Tobacco brand names are clearly identifiable for at least a third of the time during broadcasts of many major sporting events. I watched some of the cricket match last night and it was difficult to watch the cricket, there were so many ads around the place for Benson and Hedges in one form or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of issues relating to this which we need to address. There are some arguments to say that this legislation should not go through. The arguments mainly focus on the question of being able to advertise a legal product, that companies should be free to advertise those legal products, that it is a restraint of some sort of freedom if they are not able to do so. I guess the first argument against that is that in many regards, particularly in regard to young children, cigarettes are not a legal product. In all States in Australia, there are constraints upon the age at which cigarettes can be sold to minors and clearly, for that group, the target group for many of these sponsorships, there is no legality about buying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I think that there is an argument which says that, if we start with tobacco, where do we stop? We might go on to alcohol next. We might even go on to Mars bars, because those things are also, in one way or another, potentially unhealthy in various forms. The argument, of course, for tobacco is unique. There is no safe level of smoking. One cigarette is bad. It is as simple as that. It is not as bad as 20 and it is not as bad, again, as 100, but it is certainly bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with, say, alcohol is not use; the problem with alcohol is misuse or abuse or overuse. It is therefore a completely different kettle of fish, and it is very clearly appropriate in that situation to direct education and target campaigns at misuse and overuse and responsible use of alcohol. I will not enter into the debate about Mars bars. I think that is a somewhat facetious argument sometimes put up which really has no particular merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other arguments put on the other side of this debate include the fact that there is an important influx of money into various sporting events and that, without that influx of money, there would not be the ability to hold those sporting events. Overseas experience, of course, shows that that is not, in fact, the case. Even in these recessionary times, it has been possible overseas to find alternative sponsors for virtually every major tobacco sponsored event which has been removed from sponsorship by various legislative bodies. I do not think that is an argument either. The provisions in the legislation allow for particular consideration to be given to minor, small sporting and similar events, should they face difficulties, and that is something which I think we should certainly support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of concerns which are relatively minor concerns. I am not quite sure about the importance of introducing the exemption for clothing and I hope that it will not be possible to exploit it as some sort of loophole. I am not sure about the importance of Norfolk Island. I think the loophole there has been potentially closed inasmuch as I do not think, for example, we will start seeing test matches televised to the mainland from Norfolk island. I think that is not a problem, but it is something which was raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the bottom line is that we will save thousands of lives, but we will also save thousands, in fact, millions of dollars. I want to refer to one of the arguments put forward by the tobacco companies. In relation to the amount of money&mdash;which is about $2.5 billion&mdash;which flows into government coffers through various excise charges and licensing fees, a corporate relations manager for W.D. and H.O. Wills, Mr George Symmes, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in January last year. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's going to come a day when, if it's not careful, the Government is going to kill the golden goose.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems is that he has missed out on a whole side of the balance sheet. On the other side of the balance sheet are billions of dollars worth of expense in looking after people affected by tobacco, looking after the health expenses, the hospitalisation, the time lost from work which, in relation to tobacco and a few related drugs, is estimated to be well over $12 billion by some authorities, and even higher by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this legislation will result in an overwhelming benefit in health terms. There is an overwhelming benefit in preventing our kids from taking up smoking. There is also an overwhelming benefit in economic terms in this sort of legislation. I congratulate the Government on finally producing the legislation. I am sad that it took so long. I am happy it is here, and the coalition will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill. I think we have been seeing far too much of this sort of legislation in Australia in recent times. After listening to some of the hyperbole from honourable members opposite, I might remind the last speaker, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), that many years ago in France there was a national strike of doctors, the main consequence of which was that the death rate dropped dramatically. It may have been coincidental, but it is a fact that it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the paper put out by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) we are told that $6.8 billion is the cost of cigarette smoking in Australia. This is a figure that cannot be substantiated, and any honest academic&mdash;and heaven help us, there are a few of those in Australia today&mdash;could blow holes as big as Queensland in any supporting arguments. The honourable member for Lowe now tells me that the cost is $12 billion. Obviously what we do is pick a figure out of the air and square it and use that as evidence. Such arguments, I believe, should be treated with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that tobacco related diseases are the biggest and most preventable diseases in Australia. If we do our calculations on the basis of relating deaths as a result of heart attacks, strokes and other illnesses to tobacco, yes, we can probably arrive at that figure. However, I suspect that there are often contributory or other causes for these deaths. I suspect that, if the real figures were done, we would find that diabetes causes more deaths than any other single factor in Australia. If we took all the ramifications of diabetes control and if we were to put into diabetes research some of the money that we squander in other areas, I am sure we could dramatically reduce the number of related deaths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hepatitis B is another one, of course. It is a disease introduced as a result of the lack of care of governments in the past; a disease which has only recently come to Australia and is now endemic and kills very many people. It is a disease which is highly curable and totally preventable, but what do we hear about that? What do we hear about the people in Australia who die as a result of their use of analgesics? We have not counted them, but I will bet there are thousands. Fortunately for us, they are nearly all middle-aged women screaming for themselves in suburbia. They are obliging enough to die quietly, so we do not do much about that. I think we have to look into these claims much more deeply than is done in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to another problem that I see here, I have a regard for history. In the early 1950s cannabis was not illegal in Australia; it was widely prescribed pharmaceutically. Then, at the behest of the American drug authorities, we decided it was a wicked substance that had to be dramatically controlled. We have gone full circle and States in Australia are now realising that the dangers of marijuana are grossly overstated. Some of the more enlightened States have actually taken steps to play down marijuana smoking as a crime. Yet we are still staining the records of very many people for the heinous crime of having a smoke of marijuana. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are heading down the road of making cigarette smoking the same sort of crime. When we get that far, what we will do, of course, is drive cigarette smoking into the hands of organised crime. That will be another great success for society. I might add that we have done that with hard drugs. The honourable member for Lowe mentioned that hard drugs represent a very small percentage, just over 2 per cent, of all drug deaths in Australia. I very strongly subscribe to the view that hard drugs should be available on prescription from chemists to take organised crime out of the supply of these drugs. I believe that we would then have far fewer problems. I note that in civilised countries elsewhere in the world&mdash;in the UK, for instance&mdash;heroin is prescribed for terminally ill cancer patients. Not so in Australia. I suppose our medical friends are frightened that the people might become addicted, despite the comfort it gives them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parallels have been drawn with the dangers posed by asbestos. This is probably right, because here again we have seen a grossly overstated consequence of asbestos. We spent $300m in the ACT removing asbestos from buildings, but none in Queanbeyan where the workers live&mdash;all that money in Canberra and other capital cities throughout Australia. Yet the Neville report just brought down in Western Australia for the first time documents the real consequences of asbestos and for the first time puts forward the relative risks of asbestos. I commend the reading of that report to every member of this House, particularly the medicos. It puts that matter into a perspective which would result in the people of Australia, when they grasp it, becoming very angry about the money that is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the suffering of people. If people choose to smoke and know the consequences, it ill behoves society to legislate. I worry about a society that believes that it is the sole arbiter of what is good for people; it must take the great father role and direct people. I believe people should have a much greater freedom of choice. Remember that the people who die as a consequence of tobacco are invariably people in their late middle age&mdash;it is a sad fact that everybody dies of something or other&mdash;and I think research would bear that out. </PARA>

We are told that the Government would set up a fund to compensate those people who used to get sponsorship from tobacco companies but no longer do. The Government should have a responsibility to place this additional burden on the taxpayers. But the reality, as we have seen in Western Australia&mdash;a State that has the same sort of fascist legislation and set up the same sort of mechanism to support sport&mdash;is that what gets supported is politically correct sports. What gets supported overwhelmingly is sports in the city areas&mdash;country areas get neglected. That will be the consequence of this legislation. We will find that numerous small golf clubs in some country areas will not get the compensation and sports such as rifle shooting&mdash;not politically correct&mdash;will be neglected by the bureaucrats making these sorts of decisions.

Yet it is quite clear that the social consequences of alcohol are far worse, far more pernicious and affect more people than tobacco.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cigarette smoking causes 99 per cent of emphysema and 98 per cent of lung cancers.

This is one instance which is repeated over and over again in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made light of the fact that people die in their 50s and 60s from smoking. I point out to him that they also die in their 40s. He said it was their own choice whether they smoked or not. This is not quite the truth. People take up smoking at an early age and become addicted. It is then no longer a choice. A number of our colleagues regularly try to give up smoking without any success at all. People are influenced to take up smoking when they are young. Undoubtedly advertising is one of these influences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies which have been conducted show a correlation between advertising and the rate of smoking and the effect when advertising has been removed. A study in Canada showed that, after advertising was removed from sporting clubs, the drop in the incidence of smoking in one year was 8 per cent, which is quite an effective drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the effects on children with which we are most concerned and this is why the advertising has been directed to sporting clubs where children are likely to be influenced. I believe there is a correlation between the popularity of a cigarette brand and its association with a local football club. Children at the ages of 12, 13, 14 and 15 are not in a good position to make a judgment about whether they should smoke. They perhaps believe that they are immortal and they discount the warnings they get. By the time they are of an age to realise the hazards, it is too late and they are already addicted to smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued by the tobacco companies that they are advertising not to gain new smokers&mdash;that is, not to gain the young smokers&mdash;but I think this is a somewhat spurious argument. How does one make a product attractive enough to get somebody to switch to that product without at the same time making that product so attractive that somebody will take it up? I am not claiming that advertising is the only reason why people smoke&mdash;obviously, peer pressure and other pressures do contribute&mdash;but it is certainly one of the pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are one of the biggest growing groups of smokers. A study that I carried out five years ago indicated a mounting incidence amongst children and, although this study was done locally in South Australia, it was one of the first studies to show a greater incidence of smoking amongst young women than young men. A study by the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> in 1989 entitled `Cigarette smoking in Australian schoolchildren' found that by the age of 15 years, 33 per cent of the girls and 26 per cent of the boys in the study sample had smoked at least one cigarette. That seems to be the start of what becomes a life-long habit which can lead to death in the mid-40s, early 50s and later, in addition to that enormous economic cost that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>

I do have sympathy for that argument. But I think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would have to acknowledge that in many things in life there is more than one principle at stake.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, which I understand finally has cross-party support, will have the effect of setting a minimum standard for bans on tobacco advertising. While I support the thrust of this Bill and applaud its stated objectives, there are a number of comments I want to make about tobacco growers and Cabinet's commitment to ensuring that small sporting and cultural events in rural Australia are not adversely affected by the ban. I also want to make some comments about the anomalies associated with the ban already referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent the most significant tobacco growing area in Australia. The townships of Mareeba, Dimbulah and Mutchilba are totally dependent on tobacco for their viability. Not only are there more than 300 growers in this area of the Atherton Tableland, but also the service industries associated with tobacco make it a huge employer and the lifeblood of these towns. Hard-working farmers have been growing a legal product for many years. Unfortunately for them, but perhaps fortunately for the health of the nation, public policy in Australia dictates that fewer people consume tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this House many times before, there is currently a quota system in operation for tobacco growers. That quota system&mdash;the amount that growers can grow in a given year&mdash;is based on the previous year's consumption. As domestic consumption decreases, the amount of tobacco that local growers can grow also decreases, thus adversely impacting on their livelihoods. This is a human cost not often thought about when discussing the tobacco issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ban on tobacco advertising, if the manufacturers' arguments are to be believed, should not have any impact at all on growers. The manufacturers argue that advertising does not get more people to smoke. They argue that it is simply used as brand identification&mdash;that is, getting people to change from one brand to another. Therefore, growers should not be adversely affected at all by this particular ad ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that growers have to develop a strategy to ensure their future long term viability. Unless such a strategy, involving value adding and exporting, is embarked upon, growers and their families, and towns such as Mareeba and Dimbulah, will be doomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that growers have agreed, along with manufacturers and union representatives, to take part in a national tobacco task force to look at impediments to sustainable growth, investment and competitiveness in the industry, and to look at the means of overcoming these impediments in order to develop a national growth strategy for the industry. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) will shortly be announcing the make-up of this task force. I believe such a task force will be the catalyst for putting confidence back into the tobacco industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I have stated that the ad ban on tobacco products should not affect growers, I have always been concerned about the effects such a ban would have on small sporting and cultural events in rural and remote Australia. One of the anomalies in this legislation is that it allows the Minister to exempt certain events from the ban if the Minister deems such events to be of national or international significance and if those events would be lost to Australia if the ad ban applied to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult&mdash;indeed impossible&mdash;to explain to people in Mareeba, Dimbulah or other parts of my electorate that the Minister can exempt specific events that are of international significance and which might fold if the ban applied to them, but there will be no such exemption for events such as the Mareeba Rodeo, the Dimbulah Festival or the rugby league in Mount Isa. The Mareeba Rodeo is just as important to the people in that town as the Adelaide grand prix is to the people in South Australia. Whilst this is an anomaly in the legislation&mdash;and one I am prepared to wear because the legislation is a giant step in the right direction&mdash;it should not be at the expense of these very important sporting and cultural events in rural Australia that are currently sponsored by tobacco companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the legislation allows a lead-in time of some three years, until 31 December 1995, to allow sponsored organisations to locate alternative funding. Whilst it may be all well and good for major events such as the Winfield Cup or the Benson and Hedges World Series Cricket, which I am sure will have sponsors queuing up to fund them, it does not help specific events in my electorate; for example, the very well, and now nationally, publicised Mareeba Rodeo, which is actually called the Peter Jackson Mareeba Rodeo, or the Dimbulah Festival, which is actually called the Dimbulah Tobacco Festival. I do not think it would matter much if there were a 20-year lead-in time; sponsors will not be lining up to fund these events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these events were to fold, it would be devastating for rural and remote Australia. These events are bigger than Ben Hur in their specific towns. They attract a lot of tourists and are part of the social fabric of these towns. It is for this reason that I have pushed Cabinet, specifically the Minister at the table and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), to give a commitment to ensure that these events survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that Cabinet has decided that the Government will re-examine the effects the ban is having on small sporting and cultural groups after the ban has been in operation for a short time and that, whilst the States have the prime governmental responsibility for alternative sponsorships, especially through health promotion funds, if there is evidence that the ban is causing genuine hardship for small sporting and cultural groups, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories is to bring back to Cabinet a proposal to relieve the groups so affected. </PARA>

If, after the implementation of this legislation, which remember it does not come into effect until 1996 in fact, if there are still some problems, I could then go back to Cabinet with a proposal if they were desperate and if the States wouldn't respond in a positive way.</PARA>

The Cabinet, Minister Kelly and Minister Staples are to be congratulated for their conciliatory and understanding attitude to the plight of rural Australians and the importance that rural Australians place on these extremely significant sporting and cultural events. These events will not only survive but also thrive as a result of the commitment that has been given by the Ministers and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the relevant Ministers is in stark contrast to that of Mr David Hill, the General Manager of the ABC. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will probably recall, when this Bill first came to Caucus it was deferred so that concerns, such as mine and others, could be appropriately addressed. Those concerns were genuine and I believe&mdash;despite what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had to say&mdash;they have now been appropriately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS> on ABC television on 11 November, Mr Hill was interviewed&mdash;on his own station&mdash;by John Lombard and he made the outrageous accusation that the tobacco industry had nobbled Caucus to stop this legislation going through before the election. I will quote from a transcript of that interview dated 11 November 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAVID HILL: I think enough Caucus members have clearly been got at by the awesome tobacco industry who made it clear when Cabinet made a decision earlier this year to ban tobacco sponsorship&mdash;but they've fought it every inch of the way. The only surprise for me is that we've seen such a large scale capitulation of Caucus so early in the piece.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LOMBARD: Nobbled?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HILL: I think so. I think that the members of Parliament in those marginal electorates that grow tobacco have been got at directly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no need for me to tell you whom he is referring to there. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the tobacco industry has been working the lobby machine overtime, and I think they will have got the sporting bodies who have had their pockets lined for years by the tobacco industry to do a lot of their pressuring and dirty work as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the interview, Lombard said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you'd understand most of the rural members are concerned that their sports in country electorates which would be affected by this and yet major events can get exemption by being declared international.</PARA>
<PARA>Hill said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's to prop up South Australia with the Grand Prix. Most of the sporting dollars from the tobacco industry go to the mass sports&mdash;not the farmer's sports in the bush electorates, and they go there because that's where the television coverage is&mdash;that big money goes to the cricket from B and H and to Winfield Rugby league and that's where the industry is fighting the rearguard action. Really, whether or not there's a rodeo in a tobacco growing electorate in North Queensland is frankly irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, it appears to me that David Hill has used the TV station of which he is the General Manager to peddle his own views and to maliciously and falsely make accusations. These have been shown to be false by the fact that this Bill is in this House tonight. Mr Hill should be ashamed of himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I fully support this Bill, I wonder whether Mr Hill's actions have the full support of his board. I only hope that Mr Hill will now use his obvious influence with the ABC to ensure that the Mareeba rodeo is telecast live throughout Australia next year and that he personally undertakes to ride the bucking bull on this particular occasion. He has been speaking plenty of it. It would be a pleasant change to see him ride it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard some pretty harsh criticism of David Hill. I must say that there is not much love lost between David Hill, members of the Opposition or the organisation that he heads up, but I ought to say on the public record how much I respected the stand that he took as Chairman of the North Sydney Rugby League Club. The club incurred the considerable wrath of the New South Wales Rugby League. At one stage it looked as though it might even be thrown out of the competition. Obviously, Mr Hill&mdash;and I have never spoken to him about this&mdash;believes very strongly in this cause, as I and others do, and was prepared to take considerable risks. I believe he deserves to be congratulated. I suspect that what he said had a considerable element of truth in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sensitivity that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) has shown tonight lends credence to that. The honourable member is concerned about the Mareeba Rodeo and the Dimbulah Festival, and with some justification. But he cannot have it both ways. He has gone to considerable lengths in this speech tonight to lock the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in to looking after those two events which may need to have international significance if they are to survive. That might be his remedy under the Broadcasting Services Act. It seems to me that the honourable member needs to create international interest in the Mareeba Rodeo and the Dimbulah festival. That will be their salvation. But that would seem to be their only salvation within this legislation. The Minister stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has come in Australia to end tobacco advertising. The passage of this legislation is among the most important health initiatives that can be taken by this Government. By supporting the trend away from smoking, it will make a major contribution to reducing illness and premature mortality amongst Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree with that statement and I congratulate the Government, although I am disappointed that in some respects this Bill has stopped short of what I believe could have been a more comprehensive ban. I presume that the reason for the Bill stopping short is the sort of pressure that was being applied by honourable members, such as the honourable member for Kennedy, who obviously have a considerable vested interest in softening the legislation to the extent that they have. The one to which I alluded is one considerable exemption that has been granted. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill removes the potential for tobacco advertising but not to the extent that extreme measures are taken.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International events to be held in Australia will be able to apply for an exemption from the ban.</PARA>
<PARA>We might well expect&mdash;although I hope we do not&mdash;a plethora of applications for so-called international events to be held in Australia. I am not seriously suggesting that the Mareeba Rodeo or the Dimbulah Festival might qualify in that regard, but there might be some hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the Opposition is supporting this legislation, deficient though it is in some respects. Most of the issues have been adequately canvassed, but it needs to be clearly understood that this legislation is intended to deal with inconsistencies and loopholes within the existing law. It is for that reason that this legislation was necessary. The existing laws are clear but they have been consistently flouted over the years, and that needed to be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to say, because from my point of view it is relevant, that I come to this debate with a long personal involvement in sport, as a participant, a supporter and a spectator. I have always believed that tobacco promotion and sport were diametrically opposed. Smoking is clearly and unequivocally unhealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could spend all night debating the extent to which smoking is unhealthy. In the end that would be pointless. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) correctly pointed out, many deaths are indirectly attributable to cigarette smoking. But I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind&mdash;and the speaker after me may well clarify this&mdash;that smoking is unhealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sport, of course, is quite the reverse, both for participants and, to some extent, even for spectators. Sport is a healthy activity. Connecting sport and smoking in any way at all is completely hypocritical. In his second reading speech, the Minister actually described the connection as bizarre. That is a slightly stronger description but I agree  that it is bizarre to in some way connect these two activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some way tobacco use has always been legitimised, enhanced or otherwise made respectable by its connection to sport. One does not have to be too sharp to realise that this is clever marketing. Every day we see evidence of clever marketing; it is effective. But, ultimately, in this particular case it is misleading, fraudulent or even deceptive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern on a political level&mdash;as we found in the recent Queensland election with car stickers stating, `Voters are Smokers'&mdash;is that in supporting this legislation we may run the risk of offending people who smoke. I suppose that is a risk that many of us in this place have been prepared to take, for obvious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that I have no particular criticism of tobacco users. I am not happy about people smoking near me or lighting up in a restaurant when I am at the table next to them. But, by and large, I do not have any criticism of their choice to smoke. It is, after all, as speakers in this debate have said, a legal product. For that reason, of course, people are free to choose to smoke if they want to, and rightly so. Actually, I suspect that it would not be legal if we had known years ago what we now know about the effect of tobacco not only on the health of those who use it but also, as we found out more recently, on the health of those who are exposed to it involuntarily&mdash;or passively, as it is more frequently known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is not possible to ban it now. The argument that we have heard in the debate on both sides to some extent&mdash;if not in the Parliament, certainly behind the scenes&mdash;is that if we are really serious about this problem we ought to ban the product. That might well appeal to a lot of people but it is clearly impractical or impossible to do it now. Prohibition will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we can discourage the use of tobacco. Indeed, as members of Parliament, we have an absolute responsibility to do that. Comprehensively banning advertising, which is a further step that this Bill takes, will achieve this. It will not prevent people from making a choice to use a legal product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us be quite clear about one thing, because this is really the fundamental lie in the whole of this debate: advertising has only one purpose and that is to sell a product. This is so whether the advertising is incidental or not. Any argument to the contrary is clearly flawed. It is even difficult to take such an argument seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the argument that has been run before us by the tobacco companies time after time is that their largesse in the sponsorship of sporting activities is not to encourage people to take up smoking; not to encourage children who are exposed to the advertising to take up smoking. Those companies tell us that is not the reason at all. It is for some other obscure reason&mdash;for example, promoting brand awareness or encouraging people to change brands. That argument is absurd; it is not the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others have spoken about the effect of cigarette smoking, and I am prepared to concede that there may be some doubt about the full extent of the statistics, but I am prepared to accept that since 1965 half a million Australians have died prematurely from diseases due to smoking. The cost to the nation of this has been incalculable, in my view. Clearly, tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable&mdash;and that is probably the operative word&mdash;cause of death and disease in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been reminded about the number of deaths that have occurred in Australia in recent years. Significantly, most people who take up smoking adopt the habit before they reach the age of 20. I think that is a very telling statistic. My father, who smoked most of his life&mdash;and died, incidentally, prematurely&mdash;took up smoking during the war, when a lot of young men of his era did, and he could never stop smoking. I think it still is the case today that people who take up smoking do so at a very young age. I believe that we have a very real responsibility to make sure that children are protected from the advertising of tobacco products, incidental or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have that responsibility, not only as a member of Parliament doing my work in this place, but also for my own young children. I have never doubted that the tobacco industry's ultimate objective was to convince my children to take up smoking. I resolved long ago to resist that at all costs. Children, as others in this debate have said, are most easily influenced and they certainly are influenced, as the research has shown, by the association of certain sports and certain sports people with tobacco brands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, in this so-called enlightened age, we are becoming much more aware of the damage caused to children by what they see and hear on television. Recently, I am pleased to see, concerns have even been expressed, for the first time, about the advertising of certain products&mdash;particularly junk food products&mdash;during children's programs on television. I share those concerns and I expect that we are going to hear more about that issue in this place before too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry, as the honourable member for Kennedy pointed out, has campaigned strongly against this legislation. Some of its tactics, in my view, have been a little bit over the top. To some extent, because of this it has been successful. Fortunately, and the result of that is evident tonight, most members of this Parliament have not fallen for its propaganda. Clearly, in response to the overall declines in tobacco consumption in Australia, the tobacco companies are concerned. The tobacco industry has also enlisted the support of some of the sports which have accepted its sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say in closing that I received a copy of a letter&mdash;just one of many&mdash;that the Queensland Rugby Football League had written to Dr Hewson. I will not read the letter because I am quite sure I would embarrass Mr Livermore, the Managing Director of the QRFL, but the letter is quite threatening in its tone. It makes the point, at least in its final paragraph, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the sport and racing lobby is much stronger and more powerful than the anti-groups and will prove it in future elections.</PARA>
<PARA>I was not asked to respond to Mr Livermore's letter, but he challenges, in this particular letter to Dr Hewson, that those who are going to vote in favour of this ban should be prepared to stand up and be counted. So I said to Mr Livermore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure, in due course, Dr Hewson will respond to your letter but I wanted to tell you, for my own part, that I strongly support the move to extend the ban on the advertising of tobacco products to incidental advertising and I am quite prepared to stand up and be counted on this matter at any time. There is no doubt in my mind that the cost of treating those who become ill through smoking is enormous. I am also quite sure my young children, one of whom plays Junior League, are influenced, however subtly, by incidental advertising.</PARA>
<PARA>I said a bit more and then I put in a PS to hopefully cheer him up a bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope the Gold Coast does better in `93. I will be there to encourage them.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the Opposition has chosen to support this legislation. I congratulate the Government for bringing it forward. Albeit that it is, in my view, deficient in some respects, it is certainly a step in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of speakers have supported this legislation and the arguments that have been put forward are convincing and assuring. I think that, speaking at the end of the debate, one wonders what else there is that one can say. What I would like to do is comment briefly on some of the things that have been said by speakers in the debate and to make some personal observations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in anti-smoking campaigning since my days as a medical student. Indeed, as a student, my epidemiological study, which was undertaken back in 1975, was into the smoking habits of school children. That was undertaken with one of my colleagues, Dr Paul Magnus, who is now one of the principals of the National Heart Foundation and who has been a very strong advocate of this legislation and, of course, many anti-smoking measures. Then, during the 1970s, as a Sheffield Shield cricketer for Western Australia, I came under the influence of the cigarette companies in the sense that pressure was applied to endorse their products, to carry their bag, to wear the badges. I feel very proud that I resisted that pressure during that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make one or two comments about the contribution of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I think that he is right when he says that the figures are probably inflated. As in all of these arguments, there are hyperbolic figures put forward on both sides. I understand that these figures have been derived with the very best intentions by people, but my view would be that there is a cost and a benefit obtained from cigarette smoking. My view is that, clearly, the costs to our society are substantial, but I support the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in the sense that I think that sometimes the figures are used a little too zealously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also put the view that, in respect of passive smoking, the evidence is not as convincing as it is in other areas. My view would be that the argument for restrictions on smoking in confined areas is a clear cut one which goes along the lines of, `If I do not want to have to inhale other people's smoke or the products of their smoking, then I should not have to'. Indeed, the rights of those who wish to breathe fresh air should be paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in a restaurant, in a government building, in an airliner, or whatever the circumstance, the initiatives that have been taken by this Government have my wholehearted support. But in respect of the evidence regarding passive smoking, I would like to see more research. I remain to be thoroughly convinced as to some of the assertions that are made in that area. I have no doubt that it causes problems for people, but I think that perhaps some of the claims are hyperbolic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the argument put by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie with regard to the fact that consumption of tobacco products was falling and yet advertising was still out there, I think there is a very good reason why that is the case. The reason is that for some time now, for almost 20 years, there have been substantial anti-smoking campaigns, anti-smoking education and anti-smoking measures taken by governments of various persuasions in this country and by various health bodies. So, that very well justifies the fact that, in spite of the advertising, there are now counter measures operating and so, it is not surprising that consumption has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to his arguments about free speech, I would use exactly the same arguments in this debate as I used in the electoral advertising debate. It is quite clear that, when it comes to advertising, there is no such thing as freedom to advertise. Advertising is incredibly expensive and only people with large amounts of money have the opportunity to advertise on television and other media. There is no such thing as the freedom for me to put advertisements on those media, because I just do not have the resources. It is necessary for governments to look very closely at the sorts of advertisements, the sorts of measures that are being advertised, and for there to be a degree of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is perfectly consistent with the right and the role of Government in taking those moves. I will also comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) who was perhaps unfairly critical of David Hill. David Hill's position on cigarette smoking has been a very consistent one and, I believe, a laudable one. While the rodeo is of great importance to the honourable member for Kennedy, I think it is clear that the advertisers, the cigarette companies, are really interested in the high profile sports, the sports that have massive media coverage, and the sports that have large numbers of spectators going through the gate. I think David Hill was right when he made those comments and the stance he took on his Rugby League Club was one of great principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is about reducing tobacco consumption. It is not about prohibition and it is not about banning these substances. As has been rightly pointed out by many honourable members in the chamber, more than three million Australians are addicted to these substances and the proposition of prohibition or banning the availability of these substances would be absurd. I would argue&mdash;and the shadow spokesman opposite has said&mdash;that if we look at deaths related to smoking, alcohol and other substance abuse, then the opiates, for instance, and substances such as marijuana which are illegal in our society have a very small impact. If we were to be internally consistent in our arguments, then it is very clear that we would not allow any of these substances to be advertised, but they would be freely available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that is a very contentious view and I know that it is liable to be expanded on and `hyperbolised'&mdash;if that is a word that one can use&mdash;by the Opposition. There is great hypocrisy in respect of our position on substance abuse. There are very dangerous substances which are legal and available and substances which, I think one could fairly argue, are less dangerous and certainly have less effect on our community that are not available. That brings with it all of the difficulties of the criminal justice system, policing and imprisonment, and enormous costs to our society which relate to offences regarding those substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have legislation in this country about whether or not we wear seat belts, we have legislation on gun laws and we have legislation about censorship. They are matters which are appropriate for governments to consider and there should be a degree of regulation. Exactly the same argument can be made in respect of the advertising of these products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a mosaic of measures that we need to undertake in order to have an effect on tobacco consumption. Increasing taxation and increasing the price have been shown to have a very direct effect on consumption. It is necessary for us to have worthwhile and wide ranging education programs for our young people on the effects and dangers that relate to the use of these substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for us to have regulation and control over the marketing of these substances. A range of measures have been introduced under this Government. Great credit goes to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is at the table, for his enthusiasm and consistent pushing of these issues. We have had the banning of smoking on airlines and in government buildings, we have had legislation in respect of print advertising and we have had increases in excise. All these things will have, and have had, an effect on consumption. It is important for us to consider that we need to keep pushing and pushing on these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are a number of reasons why people choose to smoke. As long as our society remains a liberal society, as I believe it is, we will have people who make the choice to smoke. It seems to me a very strange thing to want to do, but there are forces such as peer pressure, the example of parents and elders and of course advertising. As was rightly pointed out by the honourable member opposite, the whole ethos of advertising is that it increases the sale of products. By increasing the sale of products, the price can be dropped; so advertising justifies itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that advertising is all about shifting brands&mdash;we have heard it time and time again in this debate&mdash;is completely absurd. The suggestion is that only the people who are already smokers see the advertisements and shift brands accordingly and the other 60 per cent of the population who are not already smokers are not influenced one jot by the advertising. I find that very hard to believe. I find it very hard to accept that cigarette companies spend large amounts of money on advertising and sponsorship without believing that they are in some way increasing the market. That is what underpins the whole ethos behind advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has been brought into the argument many times is that sport will suffer. One of the loopholes following the 1976 legislation was that incidental advertising via sponsorship in sport was a way of getting products on television which were not legally able to be advertised on television any more. This represented an opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lobbyist rang me this afternoon&mdash;I assumed that is who he was; after I had spoken to him for a few minutes he was not interested in talking any more&mdash;and suggested that the International Cricket Conference would isolate Australia, that it would be supported by tobacco companies to sponsor cricket overseas and Australia would suffer as a result.

One did not need to look at the large picture to get an impression when working in that environment of the effects of cigarette smoking. The common factor amongst all the patients in that chest ward&mdash;or maybe 90 per cent of them&mdash;was cigarette smoking. Irrespective of whether they were being treated for emphysema, chronic obstructive airways disease, lung cancer, asthma or some other condition, the common factor amongst those patients whose condition was serious enough for them to be in hospital and to incur the expense that related to their being there was cigarette smoking. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I received a letter from Stephen Leeder, Professor of Public Health and Community Medicine in the Department of Public Health at the University of Sydney, dated 2 December 1992. It is worth reading:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Melham,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent Caucus decision to support the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill is good news for Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find enclosed a study of childhood smoking which my colleagues and I conducted in Newcastle some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several factors emerged in the uptake, maintenance and quitting of smoking by 10-12 year old children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those children who approved of cigarette advertising at even this young age, were more likely to take up smoking during the following year or continue smoking if they were smoking already, or less likely to quit if they were smokers, than children who did not approve of cigarette advertising. That cigarette advertising does influence children's smoking behaviour has been confirmed by other Australian and international studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter to the Medical Journal of Australia this year, we have estimated that tobacco advertising might be responsible for as much as 14% of the uptake of smoking by children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Smoking by Australian schoolchildren in the future will, I am sure, be reduced because of your action. Congratulations on being part of this historic decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Stephen Leeder was the co-author of a study called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cigarette smoking and drug use in schoolchildren: IV&mdash;factors associated with changes in smoking behaviour</EMPHASIS>, which was published in 1983. The study involved approximately 6,000 school children between 10 and 12 years of age. In their study, the authors describe changes which occurred in smoking behaviour over the one-year period of a randomised control trial. They discovered that children who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to become smokers as children who disapproved. Children who disapproved of cigarette advertising were more likely to quit than those who approved of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a subsequent letter to a medical journal in 1992, they pointed out&mdash;admittedly it was only an estimate&mdash;that some 14 per cent of young children would take up smoking as a result of advertising. They extrapolated the figures from the New South Wales Cancer Council, which estimated that in 1990 almost 74,000 New South Wales school children between 12 and 17 years of age had smoked in a particular week. The authors of the letter found that about 10,000 of those children would have taken up smoking as a result of advertising, and that is pretty worrying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another interesting article that I commend to members, and it was printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Drug Issues</EMPHASIS> in June 1992. The article is headed `Tobacco in Australia: An Overview'. It goes through the history of tobacco in Australia. The article commences with the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia today. Smoking is estimated to have caused 19,899 deaths in Australia in 1991, nearly six times the number of road crash fatalities. Of drug-caused deaths, 75 per cent are due to tobacco, 23 per cent are due to alcohol (including road crash fatalities) and 2 per cent are due to opiates.</PARA>
<PARA>The authors go on to give a short history. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1972, for the first time, a mandatory health warning was required on cigarette packages and paid cigarette advertising on radio and television was phased out between 1973 and 1976. These restrictions were anticipated by the tobacco industry, and it developed strategies to circumvent the effect of such proposals. The minutes of a Rothmans management meeting held in November of 1970 give a clear indication of their thinking at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>The minutes of that meeting state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussing smoking and health, Mr Watson [then general manager] advised that we can expect more severe attacks on the industry in the near future. In Canada and the USA, advertising restrictions are pending, and in the UK, there is no cigarette advertising other than press. We can expect similar restrictions here within the next few years. This is the reason for the existence of the Rothmans National Sport Foundations and our sponsorships which are being developed in anticipation of restrictive advertising action in Australia (Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Pty Ltd 1970).</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued broadcast exposure for tobacco companies gained through sport and cultural sponsorship, and the relative ineffectiveness of the early health warning legislation, made these initial controls little more than an inconvenience to the industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why there is a need for this legislation before the Parliament this evening. As for future directions, the authors conclude by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of vestigial tobacco advertising from television screens via sponsored sporting events is an obvious priority.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are doing here tonight and why we should be applauded. That is why current surveys show that this measure is popular in the community. It is popular because the people out there in the real world know that the tobacco companies have been peddling lies for years and living on borrowed time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) made a number of pertinent points in his second reading speech that are worth repeating. He said basically that advertising has the effect of persuading children to take up an addictive, life-threatening habit. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to understand that removing tobacco advertising is primarily a prevention activity intended to reduce the number of children taking up smoking. Although advertising may not directly cause children to smoke, it reinforces other influences such as peer and social pressures which cause children to smoke. Tobacco advertisements glamorise smoking, making it seem like a desirable activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his speech he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tobacco advertising in association with sport is particularly insidious as it seeks to link an unhealthy product with a healthy activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the nub of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sponsorship of sporting and cultural activities has been exploited as an effective form of tobacco advertising.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will break the nexus between tobacco and sport and between tobacco and cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sponsor's name or logo may be recognised for up to one-third of the broadcast time of a major sporting event. In 1983 Winfield was identifiable during 33 per cent of the broadcast of the New South Wales rugby league grand final; in 1987 Benson and Hedges was identifiable during 32 per cent of a one-day cricket broadcast; and in 1989 Marlboro was identifiable during 35 per cent of the Adelaide grand prix broadcast. What a joke! What an absolute joke! The most significant study, in my view, was undertaken in 1984. The most popular brands of cigarettes amongst 12- to 14-year-old children coincided with the major sponsor of the State football code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, Winfield had the giant market share; in Victoria, it was Peter Jackson; and in South Australia, it was Escort. The tobacco companies were not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts; they were doing this to peddle and promote their product which, in my opinion, resulted in people dying before their time and young children taking up smoking in unacceptable numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can forget the launching of Winfield onto the Australian market, the linking of that product with Paul Hogan, who was reasonably popular back then, and the market share that Winfield enjoyed at the time? The promotion of Winfield, and the taking up of Winfield by young children at that time, is testament to the impact of advertising. The tobacco companies were not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts, but their time has come. This legislation is historic legislation. Unfortunately, it does not go far enough; it should go further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In time, the community will demand that we as politicians respond and go further. It is interesting that if it were left to the Opposition, whilst there is bipartisan support here this evening, this sort of legislation would not be introduced into the Parliament. The reason there is bipartisan support is not because of the shadow ministry&mdash;to his great credit, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) has championed this legislation from the very beginning&mdash;but because the shadow Cabinet got rolled by the back bench. It was exposed by Michelle Grattan in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 27 November 1992. The article was headed, `Hewson rolled over tobacco ad sponsorship' and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition leader, Dr Hewson, and the shadow ministry were rolled in the coalition party room last night over a recommendation to oppose legislation to ban tobacco advertising and sport sponsorship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow ministry, which was deeply divided, decided by a narrow margin to propose to the party room that the legislation&mdash;which was already assured of passing because of Democrat support&mdash;should be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the meeting, about 16 of 26 speakers spoke in favour of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow cabinet then met. After discussion, Dr Hewson told the party room the numbers were close, and people held strong views on both sides. He said neither view was more valid than the other. The shadow cabinet had, on balance, decided to reconsider its position and recommend that the legislation should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Party sources said that four or five parliamentarians would have crossed the floor if the decision had been to oppose the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is relevant to put that on the public record, just as it is relevant that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is here during this debate. If the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had not done a U-turn on his Fightback package, which he is announcing in its full detail on Friday, there would have been another party room revolt and the honourable member for Bennelong would have been leading the Opposition at the next Federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has been done over by the back bench on this legislation, he has been done over by the party room in relation to Fightback and that is why he has rolled over. He still holds his ideological position, but he has rolled over. At the next election the people will judge him accordingly. I much prefer the honourable member for Wentworth as the Leader of the Opposition than the honourable member for Bennelong. I do not want him around a second time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is worthy of support. It has been a long time coming but we can be proud of it. We should not allow tobacco companies to hold the sword of Damocles over our head and hide behind sporting advertisements, as they have done for so long. This legislation is in the public interest and it is great to be able to get up here tonight and support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) summed up much of what I wanted to say in response to the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), and I will leave it at that. The Government does not claim that tobacco advertising is the only factor influencing people to smoke. There are many reasons, such as parental example, sibling and peer smoking behaviour and attitudes, price, disposable income and age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this legislation the Government is signalling clearly to the community that it is taking further positive action to reduce tobacco consumption by reducing its appeal or limiting the opportunity for exposing so-called appeal, particularly to younger people. Most smokers at different times would prefer to give up smoking. Most smokers certainly do not want younger people and kids to be</PARA>
<PARA>influenced to take it up. I think it is important to recognise that this legislation does not in any way penalise smokers. In fact, I am sure it will help many of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry and its advocates&mdash;some in the community and some in the media&mdash;have been very quick to criticise the Government, alleging hypocrisy in cracking down on tobacco consumption on the one hand and levying excise on tobacco on the other. I think that was part of what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and others were referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most people are now aware of the economic study by two Sydney economists, David Collins and Helen Lapsley. They conservatively estimated the net economic cost of tobacco use and abuse in Australia at about $6.8 billion in 1988. There is also a net cost to the Federal Budget, as there is to State Budgets. What has to be understood by John Laws, Terry Vine and a few of the others who seem to make a welter of this for some unknown reason is that there are great economic, social and personal costs to the Australian community in net terms of anything that governments may try to regain through taxation excise of the real costs of this industry to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this issue in a very broad sense&mdash;and if we listen to what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, for one, was saying&mdash;we see that there are many issues of great health importance to Australia, and tobacco is one of them. By this legislation we do not deny that other things have to be done, whether it be with alcohol abuse, asbestos, hepatitis B, diabetes or analgesics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the honourable member for Kalgoorlie spoke about was freedom of speech. The whole process this Parliament has as part of our heritage and democracy means that people like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie can get up and rave on, as he did, using any form of words or any sort of argument or abuse that he cared to pour out and still have that freedom of speech. This legislation does not take that away from anyone. I hope that he makes himself a bit more aware of what this Government and other governments in Australia are trying to do in a lot of those other areas that he mentioned. As I said, this legislation does not take away from any of those other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most perennial furphy promoted by tobacco apologists and interests is that, if tobacco is a legal product, then it should be legal to advertise it for sale. It is not legal to sell tobacco to children. It is not a legal product for children, yet children have been exposed to what is effectively tobacco advertising through so-called accidental and incidental advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know what a fraudulent activity that had become. Other products which are also legally available for sale in Australia have been banned from being advertised, notably guns and prescription drugs, amongst the probably many hundreds of different items on the market in Australia. Given the detrimental effects of tobacco, which are now well recognised internationally, it is highly unlikely that any government in the world would permit its sale if it were a new product on the market. Tobacco is simply an accident of history and a very bad accident. Some have advocated that if the Government were serious it should ban tobacco outright. We recognise in this country and in many other countries today that the prohibition of social drugs such as tobacco is not practical and really does not work in itself; but allowing it to be promoted through advertising is a very different issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another furphy promoted by the tobacco industry is that tobacco ads are aimed solely at adults. They would have us believe that some barrier exists which prevents children from digesting a smoking advertisement of whatever form. Whereas adults are magically vulnerable and should be able to be appealed to through tobacco advertising, children are somehow not influenced. That is absolute rubbish, as any advertising person would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that about three-quarters of current adult smokers began smoking during or before their teenage years. In Australia, children are the future of the tobacco industry as it would see the future. They are one of the major targets of its advertising; it is nothing short of that. Learning to smoke occurs in childhood and in adolescence. If a person is still a non-smoker by the age of 20, he or she is very unlikely to take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said that tobacco advertising does not encourage people to start smoking but rather encourages people to change brands. That is arrant nonsense as well. Tobacco interests would have us believe that cigarettes run contrary to all other products when it comes to advertising. In the words of an Australian advertising agency executive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an argument (that tobacco advertising is only aimed at brand switching and not attracting new consumers) it is so preposterous it is insulting . . . To claim that cigarette advertising does not encourage smoking flies in the face of all advertising knowledge and experience.</PARA>
<PARA>This view was supported by Emerson Foote, former Chairman of one of the world's leading advertising agencies, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the public position of the tobacco industry but I don't think anyone really believes this. I am not even convinced that competition among brands is the most important purpose of such advertising. I suspect that creating a positive climate of social acceptability for smoking, which encourages new smokers to join the market, is of greater importance to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill 1992 is regarded as one of the most significant pieces of public health legislation introduced in many a year. I now turn to the point raised by the honourable member for Kennedy in his contribution to this debate. The State governments which do not have organisations such as health promotion foundations and still receive benefits from tobacco excise need to take the lead of the former Victorian Government which started not only a national but also an international trend when it set up a health promotion foundation to support the encouragement of good health practices in Australia by the use of tobacco excise and also to support sport and arts which are currently hooked on tobacco sponsorship to enable them to prosper and improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I wish to raise at this stage concerns alcohol. Alcohol abuse is a major problem in this country; one which in terms of cost to the Australian community rivals tobacco abuse. It has many other implications for our society beyond the 6,000 or so deaths that are caused directly through alcohol abuse in Australia every year. The consultative and advisory processes that I have set up with the alcohol industry are recognised as unique in the world. I hope that the industry understands the importance of those consultative mechanisms. Quite frankly, the Australian community&mdash;I know that many honourable members view the matter exactly as I do and that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is very keenly attuned to this&mdash;is very concerned about the problems of alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will do the alcohol industry no good if sections of it adopt a dog in a manger attitude, an opportunistic attitude, when it comes to alcohol advertising and labelling. Those sections are currently under scrutiny by the community and by people in governments right around Australia to make sure that they keep their side of the bargain when it comes to alcohol advertising and labelling. In particular, I commend one section of the alcohol industry&mdash;that is, the wine industry&mdash;which has shown itself to be a little different from the brewers and distillers side of the industry. At this stage the wine industry has been far more cooperative when it comes to the issue of standard drink labelling than those other two sections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alcohol industry has to understand that public opinion is very concerned about alcohol abuse, particularly among young people. People expect the alcohol industry not to take the attitude of the tobacco industry, but to recognise that it needs to be far more responsible than it has been recently in response to community concerns expressed through government. I hope that the industry recognises that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I thank my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for her support and involvement in this process, which in many regards has been a difficult one for her. I appreciate it very much. I would also like to thank the following people: Steve Woodward from ASH; Dr Robert Marr; people from medical associations around Australia such as the AMA, the RACGP and others; Rhonda Galbaly; Ron Casey; Nigel Gray; and also members of anti-cancer councils around Australia. I would also like to thank David Hill and other people involved in sport, including Lindsay Gaze and many other sports men and women of Australia, who have stood up for a long time on this issue. Sports men and women in basketball, soccer, surfing, hockey and AFL and other people such as Bob Jane have gone a long way towards breaking that nexus between tobacco and sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to recognise the work of Senator Janet Powell for the way she approached this issue when she was in the Australian Democrats and Leader of the Australian Democrats. I sincerely commend her for the work that she has done over many years. Likewise, I recognise the work of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, particularly Senator Meg Lees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen in the debate, this issue crosses political barriers. It also raises other debates. But I want to close by thanking the other members who have contributed, particularly the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth)&mdash;not only a great Australian olympian and sportsman but also someone who, as a doctor, has contributed to debates on sport&mdash;the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the provision relating to the 2 per cent fall in private health insurance, clearly whenever the incidence of private health insurance falls those people who were previously covered under the private health insurance schemes will move into the public system. That is one of the reasons why Medicare is creaking and groaning at the edges as it is now, in as much as something like 25 per cent of the population who, prior to this Government taking over, used to provide for themselves now rely on the public system, and yet the funding for the public system has not increased significantly at all. That is the reason why there are waiting lists and why the system is creaking and groaning at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these changes address those problems only very slightly. The Bill itself is still fatally flawed. We are opposed to the whole Bill, as indeed remain the governments of New South Wales and Victoria where, as I said, some 60 per cent of the population resides. However, I will not take up more of the Committee's time in going through the details of the problems of the Bill. They have all been enumerated very clearly and carefully on a previous occasion and, sadly, the Government has chosen not to address them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill that has been amended has, as the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) indicated, been amended only quite slightly. The issue of national goals and targets had indeed been canvassed and it was agreed that they would form an important part of the Medicare agreement. The course of this agreement will see those national goals and targets developed so that we can move to a situation where we will be able to measure performance in terms of the impact of measures that we take, whether it is in the health system or in terms of public health with respect to the well-being of the population. That is a very significant move forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in regard to Medicare agreements, this legislation represents a setting out of issues of principle that are spelled out and will be reflected in reciprocal legislation. The agreements with the States will provide an opportunity to particularly address issues of access but also to provide funds for a number of incentive payments which will do a great deal to improve the health system in this country, particularly the hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal has been said about the issue of health insurance and private health insurance. It was implicit in the introduction of Medicare that there would be a significant fall in private insurance. That occurred. Over recent years there has been a rather slower but nevertheless appreciable drop in the numbers of people who have private insurance. That is inevitable, given the fact that we have universal health insurance that not only goes to primary health care but also is a foundation of a great deal of the funding that we provide for the hospital system in this country. Since the introduction of Medicare the Government has provided very significant funds at the national level&mdash;something of the order of $4 billion&mdash;but in this legislation we are indicating that over the next five years there will be a significant increase in public funding. That is on top of indexation. That was negotiated as part of the 1988 agreement. It is a special index that reflects factors in the hospital system and also the ageing of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional funds that are being provided represent a significant real increase in funds from the Commonwealth to the States over the life of the agreement. Notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable member for Lowe, the reality is that no State will lose as a result of the new Medicare agreement. The bonus system will operate in a way in keeping with the understanding that I think was very much present in the meeting of health Ministers in April, and in subsequent discussions with health Ministers; that is, that the Commonwealth will seek to ensure that, where there was a need for additional public patients to be cared for, no State would be disadvantaged by that trend. That is the way that the bonus system will operate to provide additional assistance to States where they incur additional costs because of an increase in the number of public patients within the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no intention in terms of this legislation to move away from the situation where people have the choice to opt, within the public hospital system, to be private patients or public patients. But there is certainly made explicit in this legislation what has always been implicit within Medicare, and that is that people should be admitted to a hospital system essentially on the basis of clinical need, not on the basis of their insurance status or their financial status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why we have introduced into this Bill the concept of a hospital charter, so that it is made much more explicit, much more clear what people's rights are within the public hospital system in this country. I think that by that mechanism, we are pointing to not only the need to provide additional resources, which we are certainly doing this year to reduce waiting times, but also to ensure that, when people do need to wait for hospital treatment, the rules are made transparent, that people are clear as to how the system is operating, who controls the system and, indeed, that we get some national consistency in terms of the way that we describe waiting lists, the way that they are calculated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked the Institute of Health and Welfare Data, in its capacity as a body that operates with the cooperation of the States and State health departments, to develop an approach to defining and measuring waiting lists. A great deal is said about the numbers waiting, but the reality is that we have very little hard information. I think that is regrettable. At a national level, that information should be collected by a body such as the Institute of Health and Welfare Data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, the changes were to pick up something which we had canvassed with Health Ministers and agreed would be part of this new health agreement in terms of goals and targets. It picks up the concept of a review, where there is a movement of the order of 2 per cent in terms of fall in private insurance. That was also something that had essentially been canvassed with the States in terms of the agreements that flow out of this legislation. For that reason the Government had no difficulty in picking up these amendments. I commend the amendments and the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance (Quality Assurance Confidentiality) Amendment Bill 1992, which has come back from the Senate, relates to quality assurance and giving provisions for freedom from immunity for people participating in that particular process. This particular issue was canvassed in some detail in this chamber on a previous occasion, so I do not propose to go into any great details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments, in essence, have watered down the Minister's discretion in regard to the information that should be disclosed during a QA investigation. The Opposition's view was that the discretion should not be watered down but should be completely removed, because we were fearful that as it remains, perhaps not quite as seriously as it was originally but still even as it remains, it will undermine the whole aim of the legislation. Moss Cass has put it very well. He said that health care professionals have been encouraged, under the protection of the legislation, to openly and fully discuss the care they have provided to various patients, even admitting deficiencies which can be recognised with the wisdom of hindsight. In that way, it is hoped that the quality assurance process can improve the quality of care which always has a mixture of both science and art. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ministerial discretion remains in the Bill and doctors are treated in the way that patients expect to be treated&mdash;by being fully informed of all the implications of a course of action or treatment, with failures; or statutory immunity with its possible retrospective removal&mdash;how many doctors are likely to participate in the quality assurance process for which statutory immunity has been provided? I guess the answer is, sadly, all too few. If, through fear, doctors and other health care professionals decline to participate&mdash;and they cannot be forced to&mdash;then I guess the answer to the question of where we are is exactly where we are now, and that is, in many regards, nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if there is suspicion that a misjudgment might have occurred, everyone closes ranks and no-one knows anything about what might have happened. This is seen over and over again in court cases where patients endeavour to gain compensation for what they consider to be medical mistakes. Mistakes are made and it can only help to be able to discuss them and to learn rather than bury them and hope no-one finds out. Sadly, the situation as presented back to the House from the other place is not going to resolve this particular problem. If we do not understand how the mistakes are made, we are doomed to continue to repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation as it stands will prevail over all the States, and quality assurance process with statutory immunity&mdash;which is very slow getting under way because of the nervousness of doctors being allayed&mdash;will grind to a halt all over the country. Future patients will sadly be the most significant losers as inappropriate treatment is undertaken without the benefit of peer review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate of course that for the large part of this legislation there will be a very sensible Minister for health making those decisions, so hopefully the problem will not arise. But for a short time, at least, we will be under the aegis of the current Minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), and the problem is that the ministerial discretion may not be used appropriately or, more importantly, it may be feared that it will not be used appropriately. It is the fear rather than the actual use which is important in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So sadly again we are of the view that this is inadequate legislation. It will not actually meet the aims which it tries to, aims which are very laudable, aims which we support. It has been undermined by that particular clause 106N and the amendments to that particular clause water down and improve the situation only slightly; they do not resolve the underlying problems. </PARA>

But in this legislation, which is extremely important for the reasons indicated by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), there is nevertheless the constraint in the sense that, in particular situations, clearly there is a responsibility which does extend beyond the health area into the area of potential criminal negligence, and in those areas a compromise in some ways has had to be reached.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes changes to provisions of division 4B of the Migration Act, which deals with the custody of people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation. The changes proposed are interim measures until the commencement of the relevant provisions of the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992 in November 1993, which establishes a new and simplified regime for dealing with all unlawful persons, irrespective of their mode of entry to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall that in May this year I presented a Bill to the House designed to ensure that people who arrive in Australia by boat without prior authorisation remain in custody until they leave Australia or are granted an entry permit. I believed then, and I continue to believe, that only those granted authority to enter should be permitted to move into the general community, and that a clear signal be sent that entry into the Australian community cannot be achieved simply by arriving here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aspects of division 4B were challenged in the High Court, which recently handed down its judgment validating the custody regime it sets out. I applaud this very valuable decision, which clearly affirms the Government's right to maintain control over Australia's borders for the protection of the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision did, however, uncover doubts as to the validity of custody under section 88 of the Migration Act, in which most boat people were held before the commencement of the amended legislation on 6 May 1992. Section 88, which formed part of the major 1989 amendments to the Migration Act, replicates a longstanding provision in the earlier legislation. A majority of the judges held that detention ceased to be lawful under section 88 after the destruction of the boat on which the person arrived or in other circumstances making the boat unavailable for the person's departure. While most of the boats on which the people in section 88 custody arrived remain in existence, including the two boats on which the 37 plaintiffs before the High Court travelled to Australia, there is nonetheless considerable uncertainty now surrounding the lawfulness of section 88 custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This uncertainty turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the haphazard fate of the boat on which the people travelled. Should custody have become unlawful, it is as a result of a technical breach. This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people arrived in Australia unlawfully and their detention was based on our understanding of the provisions of section 88 at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers for the boat people are now publicly discussing compensation for unlawful detention, and already applications have been lodged in the High Court on behalf of some of the detainees. While our assumptions about the operation of section 88 may have been misplaced, and the High Court has offered important guidance on this, the issue still remains to be tested in numerous cases. In the case of one boat, for example, the people were rescued at sea by the Royal Australian Navy as their boat foundered. They were brought into Darwin on HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Townsville</EMPHASIS>. One passenger who was rescued described their relief at being rescued in last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>. There must now be serious doubt about the custody of this group. It would be ironic if those rescued could now sue the Commonwealth for the privilege. Some 300 boat people in all are potentially affected. It is possible that, were a court to find for these people, the Commonwealth could be ordered to pay a very considerable sum by way of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who had arrived here without authority and who had been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined. This Bill, therefore, introduces a provision which limits any compensation payable to an amount of $1 per day for any period of detention which a court of competent jurisdiction finds to have been unlawful. This will apply to all designated persons under division 4B of the Migration Act, including those who have already commenced proceedings against the Commonwealth for damages in relation to claimed unlawful custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, this Bill seeks to put beyond doubt certain aspects of the custody scheme that are embodied in division 4B of the Migration Act, in line with the guiding philosophy of that scheme&mdash;namely, that designated persons remain in custody until granted an entry permit or removed, subject only to the proviso that the processing of entry applications must be completed within the time frame set down in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the Bill introduces a provision to put it beyond doubt that custody is to continue between the negative determination of an entry application and the removal of the applicant. While removal must be effected as soon as practicable after the entry application is refused and all appeals against, or reviews of, the refusal have been finalised, there are inevitable lead times in procuring travel documents and making associated arrangements. It is essential that there be legislative authority for continued custody through this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces a provision to extend the permissible period of custody where an entry application decision is reopened by an unfavourable ruling of the courts. This Bill provides that the period known as `application custody', which is limited to 273 days and which is intended to ensure that a decision is taken by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs within that period, excludes any period of reconsideration following an adverse court ruling. The Bill provides an additional 90 days for each such reconsideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that the institution of proceedings in relation to unlawful custody does not prevent the Government from detaining or removing designated persons during the course of such proceedings. This Bill makes it plain that a stay order against removal may not be issued to allow an applicant to remain in Australia during the course of such proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this Bill extends the coverage of the existing provisions under division 4B to include people arriving by boat on or after 1 December 1992 until the commencement of the new measures contained in the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992, which was passed recently by this Parliament. When division 4B was enacted in May this year, it was envisaged that the planned Migration Reform Act would commence on 1 December 1992 and, therefore, the amendments related only to boat people arriving before that date. As the relevant provisions of the proposed Migration Reform Act will not now commence until 1 November 1993, it is essential to extend the existing custody provisions to cover people arriving on or after 1 December 1992, but before 1 November 1993. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992, the passage of which is being facilitated by the Opposition, is an important piece of legislation designed to ensure that the provisions of the Migration Act, which were enacted last May, are valid. These deal with asylum seekers and their continued detention until claims for refugee status have been considered and an entry permit granted as a result of that, or their removal from Australia is effected. The legislation that was enacted at that time had the cooperation of the Opposition. This legislation has the cooperation of the Opposition and has been the subject of certain comment in the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity tonight to deal with certain matters that have arisen in relation to the case of Chu Kheng Lim and others and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). In this case, the Full Court of the High Court of Australia has determined that the sections of the Migration Act in division 2, namely sections 54L and 54N, dealing with the continued detention of certain asylum seekers were valid. The Court thus accepted that the legislative power bestowed by section 51(xix) of the Australian Constitution confers upon the Executive authority to detain an alien in custody for the purposes of expulsion or deportation, together with incidental authority to detain aliens to investigate and determine an application for an entry permit and, after determination, to admit or deport such an alien. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That overall schema that we approved of in the previous legislation was obviously upheld in that landmark case. Even though other aspects of the provisions were brought into question, the fact is that the basic framework of law for dealing with aliens was upheld in this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, it will be recalled that division 4B was incorporated into the Act as a result of amendments enacted on 5 May shortly before Federal Court proceedings were brought by a number of Khmer asylum seekers who were seeking release from detention. While it is now clear that the legislation was effective in validating ongoing detention, a number of other questions have arisen. Some of these are a result of comment by members of the Bench in what I would think is obiter because it was not necessary that these matters be determined other than for the purposes of dismissing their relevance in determining the ongoing custody. Nevertheless, the court offered some guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that a number of the asylum seekers may have been unlawfully in custody under section 88 of the Act from the time they first entered Australia until the amendment that we enacted in May was put in place. It is also possible, as the Minister has alluded to tonight, that if they were held unlawfully, a claim for damages could arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defect in section 88, which has given rise to this possibility, was discussed by a number of the judges in the judgments. I note that in the joint judgment of Justices Brennan, Deane and Dawson at pages 15 and 16 the question of the unlawful custody under section 88 is discussed. Mr Justice Toohey raised that matter again at pages 38 to 40, and Mr Justice McHugh at pages 61 to 63 dealt with the same matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear that each of the judges came to the view that the detention initially is authorised only until the departure of a vessel carrying an alien from Australia or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs. The fact is that, as a result of these comments by members of the bench, a number of particular issues have now been raised in relation to a number of the asylum seekers. I must say it is the first time that I have seen reference to the possibility that some 300 of the 400 or 500 detained may be affected by this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purposes of elucidating the important principles involved, I shall read some sections of what Mr Justice McHugh had to say in his judgment dealing with the detention of asylum seekers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing with the validity of Div. 4B, it is convenient to refer to the detention of the plaintiffs before the Amendment Act was passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The source of power to detain the plaintiffs in custody before the Amendment Act was passed is unclear. Absent a statutory power of detention, no public official has any power to detain an alien who has entered the country whether or not that person's entry constituted an illegal entry.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to quote a United States immigration case and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jackson J. reminded us that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Executive imprisonment has been considered oppressive and lawless since John, at Runnymede, pledged that no free many should be imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, or exiled save by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Re Bolton; Ex parte Deane, Deane J. echoed these sentiments when he said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The common law of Australia knows no lettre de cachet or executive warrant pursuant to which either citizen or alien can be deprived of his freedom by mere administrative decision or action. Any officer of the Commonwealth Executive who, without judicial warrant, purports to authorize or enforce the detention in custody of another person is acing lawfully only to the extent that his conduct is justified by clear statutory mandate.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One suggested source of power to detain the plaintiffs is in s.88(114) of the Act. However, the provisions of s.88 are only activated by the arrival of the vessel at `a port' which by s.4(1) of the Act means `a proclaimed port'. While the case stated does not make clear where the plaintiffs' boats were intercepted, it is unlikely that the interception occurred before the arrival of the boats `at a port'. Furthermore at the time of the plaintiffs' arrival in Australia, a person could only be detained under s.88 `until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs'. The Court was informed during argument that the boats on which the plaintiffs came to Australia had been burned. It is difficult to see how s.88 could justify the detention of the plaintiffs when the boats upon which they arrived had been destroyed. The period of detention authorised by s.88 was clearly intended to be no longer than the period of the temporary stay of the vessel in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear when one reads section 88 that it was a provision that was intended to deal largely with seamen who might be absconding in Australia or perhaps stowaways. The expectation was that such people might be taken into custody when they left the ship or vessel and, of course, put back on the ship when it sailed and that there would be no need for custody afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that that seemed fairly logical when one read the provisions. But, when one recognises that there were no other general provisions in the Act authorising the detention, it is hard to imagine how it was ever viewed that this particular section could authorise the continued detention of people when there was no longer any vessel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not trying to challenge the bona fides of the officers involved. But when we have the judgment before us and when we read the section it becomes clear that there was no mandate for detaining people in these circumstances in this way, even though quite properly my view and the view of my colleagues on this side of the House is that nobody should be allowed to arrive at our door without a visa or entry permit. They should not be able to arrive without the opportunity for Australia to see those persons and their documents of identity to clearly establish who they are, to test whether or not they have a criminal record, whether they are of suitable character to enter Australia, whether they meet our health requirements or whether they have a disease which may affect Australia. In other words, all of the matters which are relevant to determining people's entry for permanent residence are matters which we ought to be able to examine before people present in Australia. The schema is there for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people simply get in a boat and seek to land on our shores and often deprive themselves of their documents of identity for the purposes of limiting further inquiry as to their bona fides, it is appropriate and proper in our view that they should be held in detention. That is why we supported the legislation that was brought into the Parliament in May and that is why we have continued to support the new framework of legislation that was introduced in the Migration Reform Bill, recently carried through this House and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform Bill, the earlier legislation, was a long time coming. This is not the first occasion on which the taking of people into detention in these circumstances has arisen. A matter of concern to me is the large number of vessels, some of which may have sunk before people arrived&mdash;as the Minister described, those who were picked up at sea en route to Australia. I understand that another has been burnt and destroyed. That was presumably done by quarantine officials, not by immigration officials. </PARA>

Figures have been suggested of $200,000 each. If that were the case and there were some 300 boat people who were paid $200,000 each&mdash;ignoring the Lindy Chamberlain example, in which case $300m would be involved&mdash;the figure could be as high as $60m in compensation for people who may well find that their claims for asylum are rejected; in other words, they were illegal entrants to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of those provisions is prospective in its effect and is designed to ensure that, in the event that there is a negative determination of an entry application and arrangements for removal, custody can continue until that removal is effected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces a provision to extend the permissible period of custody where an entry application decision is reopened by other legal proceedings. That is to ensure that, where the permissible time for decisions to be taken is reopened because of a decision of the courts, any further time necessary to deliberate on those matters is time that the person will remain in custody. The Bill also provides that the institution of proceedings in relation to unlawful custody does not prevent the Government from detaining or removing designated persons during such proceedings. We agree to that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill is now extended to ensure that, if there are any further boat arrivals after the passage of this legislation, after 1 December 1992&mdash;which was the date for which the Bill we passed in May was intended to operate&mdash;up to the passage of the Migration Reform Bill, which is now enacted but will not be proclaimed until 1 November 1993, detention during that period is also validated. That particular provision also has our support. In that regard we give the legislation speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a number of points about this matter generally in the time I have left. It is clear that we have had to enact legislation in quite unusual circumstances. The legislation in May was enacted in unusual circumstances. The legislation in the reform Bill was important legislation but it did not cure these defects. So we are now dealing with legislation as a result of a decision in the High Court. The fact is that we have been dealing with these asylum seekers for some three years and a number of them have been held in detention for that length of time. I do regard the fact that we have had people held in detention for that length of time awaiting determination of claims to be unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there has been a good deal of comment about where the blame for that should lie. I make it very clear that, in my view, it is not appropriate to blame individual judges, the legal profession or voluntary agencies for that. Voluntary agencies, the legal profession and judges seek to uphold the law as they see it. They seek to exercise rights that they believe they have. Often agencies, for the most honourable reasons, seek to assist those people with counselling and advice. The fact that people are making a lot of comments is a symptom of the greater problem that does exist in this area. It is the failure of the Government to be able to get it right that is involved. </PARA>

The honourable member may make comments of that sort, but what we are trying to do is close the door after the proverbial horse has bolted. We cannot hold as scapegoats in these matters the individuals who have commented adversely in relation to the Government and its record. It is as a result of Government decisions over a long period that we now face this difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the large number of asylum seekers is the expectations held out by the Government's failure properly to administer the sale of education into China, as well as the fact that after the Tiananmen Square massacre we allowed a large number of people to remain in this country without testing their claims. Those matters still remain unresolved today. It is as a result of those failures on the part of the Government that a number of people have sought to explore their rights within our courts to the greatest extent possible when in other circumstances and at other times that has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to first principles and look at the way in which the courts have behaved in these matters, it has always been clear that our principal problem has been the unduly legalistic approach that has had to be adopted because of the Government's view that we ought to provide ready access to judicial review of administrative decisions in so many of the areas affecting immigration. When we look at the provisions in the Migration Act dealing with humanitarian and compassionate cases and the way in which those provisions were interpreted by the courts using the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and its application to migration decisions, we can see why these problems have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the creative way in which the High Court of Australia got into the business of determining refugee claims, when it was always intended that these should be administrative matters dealt with by the government of the day, we can appreciate that the Government by allowing the ADJR Act to continue to apply in this area without review was creating a rod for its own back. It has always seemed very clear to me, and I have argued this strongly, that the role of the courts collectively in this area has brought about a very significant problem for the government of the day. That problem remains of the Government's own making, because it could have commenced undertaking the reform to limit judicial involvement in this area well in advance of the Migration Reform Bill 1992 that we dealt with only a matter of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential to take decisions and to challenge decisions in the way in which the Khmer and a number of other asylum seekers have challenged them is something that has remained in the legislation. It was known to the Government three years ago and could have been dealt with then. The fact that these people have been detained for this length of time is a result of the failure to grapple with these decisions at the time when it was relevant. That is a matter of deep concern to me, particularly as we see the effect that the internment has had on a number of the asylum seekers. Of course, those matters have yet to be fully resolved. I hope that there will not be any tragedy as a result of the time that it has taken to deal with numbers of these cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I place on record my appreciation of the cooperation I have received today and over the past couple of days from the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), concerning the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4). I am grateful to him and to the Opposition for their speedy response during the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important issue, and there are many things I could say. I am constantly being cautioned about saying them because, as the shadow Minister knows, these cases are not concluded yet. But let me just say this in response to him: I, too, am appalled by the length of time this matter has taken. I, too, get no joy out of people being kept in custody. I am sure I speak on behalf of every officer of my Department when I say that they get no joy from it, either. I become quite distressed by the fact that people are held in custody for such lengths of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I become bewildered, daily, by the things that are occurring. Who is it that is throwing the Panadol and other drugs over the fence for people to use when they are in a depressed state?  Who are the people encouraging some of these activities?  Who are the people in the detention centre who, in the last 24 hours, have promised that the High Court would be ruling these people refugees and giving them a large sum of money? Who are the people who, following the first set of decisions which were handed down a week or so ago in Port Hedland, met on the Sunday afternoon with those  claiming  to  be refugees  and  said, `Ignore the Department; don't take any notice of the Department when they come in and talk about a resettlement sum of money given that you are going to be rejected, because the High Court will let you out next Wednesday.'?  But the High Court did not let them out, so these people were depressed again. Officers of my Department, officers of the UNHCR, officers of the Australian Red Cross, and others engaged in the area have counselled people. It was a very frustrating matter to be dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister mentioned section 88, and the fact that we should have known about the problem that would arise. That section arose out of the old section 36, which I understand came into play in about 1958. The shadow Minister talked about taking action after the horse had bolted. That is a good racing term, and I know a bit about that. I have been on a horse that has bolted, but on this occasion I was not holding the horse when it bolted, if that is the way he wants to describe it. We can all be clever afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, maybe I was too generous in the early days. I thought I was being fair; I thought I was doing the right thing. At the time, most people applauded me&mdash;but that applause very quickly turned to criticism because it all got spun out. I did not for one minute think that people would want to spin it out for so long. I repeat: I very much doubt that some of the clients have any idea of what has been done on their behalf. In the courts recently a set of applications was made to stay the return of people to China. The fact that 12 people on that list had made application to the Chinese Embassy saying that they wanted travel documents so they could return home was completely ignored by the legal people. The fact that five were leaving the next day was again ignored by the legal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to ask ourselves what sort of dialogue goes on between some people in the legal profession&mdash;not all of them&mdash;and their clients. It stands to reason that one has to ask that question. These people want to go home and they are going home and some joker goes into the court and says, `I demand that the court stop these people leaving'&mdash;in the name of civil liberties, for God's sake! Then we have the situation of a person who wants to die and who has made up her mind to do so. We introduce a regulation that says that we ought to try to stop this and the medical profession comes down on me like a ton of bricks as though we were going to, at gunpoint, march its members in there to do it when that was not the intent. The intent was that this provided an opportunity for someone to do that. Secondly, we had no intention of interfering in the medical arrangements. This person is perfectly sane at that point. However, when she decides that she wants to go home and start eating, people approach us with a psychiatrist to say that suddenly she is not sane. The lawyer says, `Don't sign it; don't go home', and then they work on her a few days later and again she changes her mind. How confused is that woman?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things that are going on daily. Drugs are being thrown over fences for people to take, and we have to cope with that. I have to question some of the actions being taken by some people&mdash;although I suspect they are well-meaning. It is very difficult to deal with these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that I have to be brief tonight and that I cannot talk about this. I just hope that one day we are able to talk about this exercise. But I do not want to do anything to jeopardise the rights of any of these people who are seeking refugee status and, as far as possible, I will not do anything to jeopardise the fairness of their processing. So I have kept quiet. But honourable members will have to forgive me every now and again when a judge or a set of lawyers, drinking their nice flash red wine, sitting around casually in Port Hedland and photographed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> or whatever it was on the weekend&mdash;all very nice and, I point out for the record, all being paid for by the Australian taxpayer, something which is never mentioned&mdash;throwing brick after brick at everybody else. Maybe some of those bricks will come back at the right time, when this matter is looked at in the coolness of another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, without going on, this is a very frustrating area of policy. I reject some of the comments made by the shadow Minister, and no doubt there will be another day to debate them. He knows the history of section 88. He knows that this is a matter that has never been tested in the High Court before. It now has and the Government has responded as quickly as humanly possible. I regret that it is this time of night. I would have loved it to have been prime time television and radio time so that everybody could have seen this debate because I think this is something that the Australian taxpayer really is quite interested in, contrary to the comments some people make. I think they are very interested in it. When the crew of an Australian naval vessel picks up someone drowning at sea and brings that person ashore and then finds that, for its trouble, because somebody spots a loophole in the legislation, we are to be sued, I think the Australian taxpayer will be very interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Bill to the House and I again thank the Opposition for its cooperation.

<PARA>This Bill follows on from the Territories Law Reform Act, which introduced major reforms to the legal regimes of the Indian Ocean Territories, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, with effect from 1 July 1992. The Commonwealth's plans for the effective and efficient administration of the new legal regime depend in large measure on the continued cooperation of the Western Australian Government. It is pleasing to note the passage of an Indian Ocean Territories (Administration of Laws) Bill through the Western Australian Parliament on 2 December 1992 which corresponds to the Territories Law Reform Act and provides for appropriate intergovernmental arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill makes minor technical amendments to the Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, which have been requested by Western Australia in the above context. One particular amendment relates to the manner of application of Western Australian laws. The Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently provide that the provisions of the law of Western Australia are in force in each Territory, so far as they are capable of applying in the Territory. Western Australia has expressed concern about possible undesirable and unintended restrictions on the applicability of some Western Australian laws, arising from this formulation. This Bill will remove references to the applicability of Western Australia law. This will not substantially affect the laws currently in force in the Territory, but removes a possible doubt as to the validity of actions under applied laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group of amendments concerns the exercise of judicial and related powers under applied laws by Territory or State courts and court officers. The Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently deal differently with powers under applied laws which are vested in the courts and judicial officers of the Territories, and other powers, which are vested initially in the Commonwealth Minister administering those Acts. </PARA>

The Indian Ocean Territories (Administration of Laws) Bill was introduced into the Western Australian Parliament on 11 November this year. It passed through the Legislative Assembly on 26 November and the Legislative Council without amendment on 2 December this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The two amendments are not controversial, with one amendment relating to the technical manner of application of Western Australian laws. The Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently provide that the provisions of the law of Western Australia are in force in each Territory so far as they are capable of applying to the Territory. The Bill removes the reference in both the Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act to the applicability of Western Australian law. This will remove any doubt. Provisions incapable of application will still not have any real effect, but will be described as part of the law in force in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment concerns the exercise of judicial and related powers that are applied to laws by Territory or State courts and court officers. Western Australia has sought a range of amendments of these provisions to refer to court officers rather than judicial officers as currently applies. This will enable officers to be able to deal more comprehensively and consistently with the full range of courts and tribunals of the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that earlier this year this Parliament passed the Territories Law Reform Bill 1992, an important piece of constitutional legislation. Essentially, it replaced the Singaporean based regime with a Western Australian based body of law. Some 700 pieces of Western Australian Acts of Parliament were transferred in their administration of these Indian Ocean islands as a result of this legislation. The Western Australian laws are subject to modification by ordinance under the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. We have already seen a number of pieces of legislation which have been repealed or their operations suspended, or modification of the legislation for application on the islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted with interest the comments made by the Western Australian member for Kingsley, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, who is the shadow Minister in this area, regarding the Indian Ocean territories becoming part of the Western Australian State electorate. She says of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . could become part of our electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning her electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at some time in the future. That has already been recommended, although it has not been taken up in this legislation. However, I am sure that within the next couple of years that series of islands could become part of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In the long term, this is a very valid point. My colleague in the Senate, Senator Tambling, has voiced his concern at the present situation with regard to the Indian Ocean Territories and their lack of representation in the Western Australian Parliament. Currently, the laws of Western Australia apply to the Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. However, the residents of these islands have no representation in the Parliament of Western Australia where the bulk of their laws will now be made. These islands are, coincidentally, part of Senator Tambling's electorate for voting purposes in this Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very formal community of interest, particularly in the provision of education and health services, has been built up with Western Australia. The community of interest of many of the families is now with the communities in Perth and with those in Port Hedland. Looking to the future, the application of Western Australian law will inevitably lead to the incorporation of those islands into the State of Western Australia. I know that Senator Tambling is looking at initiating discussions on behalf of the Federal Opposition with the respective representative bodies on both of those islands to ensure that constitutional progress can be made in that regard in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment on the operation of the Christmas Island casino. The member for Kingsley in Western Australia, who is the shadow Minister responsible for the legislation in that House, made further comments about the operation of casinos in Western Australia. The application of this legislation applies very much to that casino. In her speech, Mrs Edwardes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government must bring the infrastructure of the islands up to mainland standards. The establishment of the casino complex may mean that the Island achieves financial independence from Australia. The casino is expected to bring around 40,000 people to the islands mainly from Indonesia. It is important that this Bill be passed to ensure that the Christmas Island casino will provide the same level of operation and service that is provided by the Burswood Casino. From a Western Australian point of view any competitor to the Burswood Casino should be operated under the same conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>The casino on Christmas Island is intended to be operational at some stage in this financial year. In the recent Estimates and Appropriations debates, Senator Tambling was able to ascertain from officers of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that that particular program has been slowed because of problems with the construction details and the construction program. However, the coalition believes that it is important that laws are in place and applicable when the casino is up and running&mdash;and hopefully the target date of March 1993 will be achieved&mdash;to ensure that there is an appropriate checking of those operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has recently placed questions on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the senior portfolio Minister regarding the appointment of Mr Read, a former Cabinet Secretary to the Western Australian Premier, Mr Brian Burke, to the position of Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We on this side of the House await with interest the answers to those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to note that last week there was an election for a new shire council on Christmas Island and a number of new councillors have taken office. It is important that under the Territories law reform legislation the new council exercise a proper and full consultative role in implementing all of the legislation and any changes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Opposition supports this legislation, it is concerned that such a small piece of legislation, albeit important, could have and should have been dealt with through the correct process of the Territories Law Reform Act earlier in the year. We believe that if the Department had consulted more completely with the relevant authorities in Western Australia instead of rushing the original legislation through the Parliament&mdash;and honourable members will recall that that took place only in June of this year&mdash;perhaps this legislation would not have been necessary. Perhaps the island communities or the Western Australian Government needed that added consultation. However, we support this legislation, and I conclude on that note. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is that I am advised as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The matters against Manners were not withdrawn on the basis that there was no evidence but because a number of his co-conspirators had been acquitted. In those circumstances it was decided that it was inappropriate to proceed further against Manners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The DPP's office has no knowledge of the matter referred to. If the matter refers to the committal proceedings against Forsyth and others then it is acknowledged that Manners was not a defendant in those proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Manners accused the former Director of misleading Parliament without direct reference to stating that it was in relation to him being referred to as a "defendant". In that context there was nothing to correct. The informations and warrants for arrest described Manners as a defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The reference in the annual report to proceedings against Manners being withdrawn against him as a "defendant" was accurate, since there were in existence at the time referred to valid and current warrants to which Manners was a defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Associate Director stood by the view that it was frivolous to claim that the reference amounted to parliament being misled. It was never intended to mean that "wanting Parliament to correctly be informed was frivolous".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) There was some initial confusion about the number and place of the warrants. The misunderstanding arose mainly because of the age of the matters and the fact that Mr Manners left the jurisdiction in June 1983 and did not take the matter up with the authorities until some 6 years after the issue of the warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Mr Manners has made persistent requests from the DPP about the warrants and has sought assurances which the office is not in a position to give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) It is so that Mr Manners was advised by letter dated 21 August 1991 that a Victorian warrant had been withdrawn. There were two Victorian warrants. It is also the case that the answer to question No. 882 said that two Victorian warrants were withdrawn. The situation is that an arrest warrant issued on 11 September 1984 upon the information of the Special Prosecutor was formally withdrawn before the Melbourne Magistrates Court by the Office of the DPP in June 1990. Another arrest warrant was issued on 11 March 1986 and included in the extradition brief forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service in the United Kingdom in late 1989 but has since been requested to be destroyed with all other papers in that brief. The reference to only one Victorian warrant is quite inadvertent and not intended to mislead. Notwithstanding that, it has been made quite clear as early as September 1990 and on subsequent occasions that the proceedings against Mr Manners are at an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) There was never any attempt to conceal the "1984 origins" of the matters against Mr Manners and there was never any attempt to mislead any English court. The Extradition Papers included the 1986 warrant but not the 1984 warrant. The 1984 warrant alleges a conspiracy between February 1979 and November 1979. As a result of further investigations, the second warrant alleges a much wider scope of the alleged conspiracy, January 1978 to June 1981. Naturally the second warrant was the appropriate warrant upon which to found the extradition application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) There was a letter dated 12 March 1991 which was not sent until 21 June 1991. That letter was not sent as a result of a misunderstanding when Mr Coghlan was sent overseas on behalf of the Director in late March 1991. The fact that the letter had not been sent was not discovered until 21 June 1991. Although the existence of those warrants was discovered by Mr Coghlan in March 1991, it was never the intention of the DPP to act on those warrants and Mr Coghlan informed Mr Manners of this in the letter dated 12 March 1991. The difficulty about the withdrawing of those warrants related to the court's inability to find the warrants. In a letter dated 21 August 1991 Mr Coghlan informed Mr Manners that action had been taken to have the Queensland warrants withdrawn and when those warrants were located they would be so marked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The Brisbane Magistrate's Court has been unable to find the warrants but the court has noted that the DPP wishes to withdraw those warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) No. The reasons why the matters were not proceeded with related to Mr Manners leaving Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Although the word inactive was used once in correspondence not from the DPP, it has been made clear to Mr Manners that all the matters with which the DPP was involved were at an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) Mr Manners has made those allegations which are vigorously denied by the DPP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) It is not appropriate to issue indemnities in relation to those matters but Mr Manners has been told and it is the fact that the DPP has no intention of proceeding on any of those matters whether the warrants are technically in existence or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) Mr Manners has had solicitors who have written to the DPP and to whom the DPP has replied. Matters raised by those solicitors have been dealt with by reply either to Mr Manners' solicitors or directly to Mr Manners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) Mr Manners has not sought financial assistance from the Commonwealth Office of Legal Aid and Family Services and therefore has not been denied the financial means, or ability through legal aid to be legally represented in Australia. The DPP is not consulted on legal aid applications and has no role to play in any such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) The answer to question No. 882 was concerned with the correspondence with the DPP, not the Commonwealth generally, as was clear from the context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) The letter contains serious allegations but not evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) When as requested Mr Manners provides evidence of those allegations that evidence will be referred to the AFP who will decide whether or not an investigation is warranted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(23) Mr Coghlan has offered to speak to Mr Manners but that offer has not been taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(24) Mr Weinberg QC acted for an accused (Veraker) in the criminal proceedings relating to the Norfolk Island Art Gallery (R v Forsyth and others). Veraker ultimately pleaded guilty and received a custodial sentence. He was represented by Mr Weinberg QC who rightly took no further part in any of the matters involving Mr Manners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(25) Mr Justice Phillips was involved before his appointment as NCA Chairman in a judicial capacity in litigation involving Mr Manners and the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(26) Mr Manners wrote to the then Chairman of the Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, on 9 August 1991 and 10 September 1991, attaching various correspondence directed to and from the DPP's office and to the Australian High Commission, London.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter of 9 August 1991, Mr Manners in effect asked the NCA to investigate his complaints and recommended the establishment of a Royal Commission. In his letter of 10 September 1991, Mr Manners required the then NCA Chairman to investigate his allegations or, if it did not, inform him that all his correspondence would be tabled "at the next meeting of the full Authority". A further letter dated 4 July 1992 was forwarded to the NCA Chairperson reinforcing the request he made on 10 September 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Commonwealth policy requires that all programs have regard to the cultural diversity of Australian society. Multicultural programs are those which address most directly those areas where there is a need to be more responsive to this diversity. On this basis, it is possible to identify Commonwealth expenditure on multicultural programs as being $94.9m in 1991-92, while estimated expenditure for 1992-93 is $94.7m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These estimates exclude expenditure on English-as-a-second-language training and settlement services for migrants because they are related, to a significant degree, to the migration program, while also being a key dimension of education in a culturally diverse society. For example, English language training cost $212m in 1991-92 and is estimated to cost $284m in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The access and equity component of the policy on multiculturalism is not possible to cost separately as it relates to improving the accessibility of existing government programs in order to improve the efficiency of service delivery, and is therefore carried out within the context of normal program design and everyday service delivery. One key component of access and equity, for example, is the Translating and Interpreting Service (costing $12m in 1991-92 and an estimated $15m in 1992-93); access and equity is also part of the rationale for grants to ethnic community organisations (costing $16m in 1991-92 and an estimated $20m in 1992-93).</PARA>

My intention is to continue this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When seeking nominations through AFCO, the normal process is that AFCO consults with its member organisations on possible appropriate nominees.

In accordance with usual practices, an advance on funding for the coming financial year is provided to AFCO on the basis of five twelfths of the previous year's funding. It is a condition of the grant that it is expended in accordance with the objects and powers of AFCO's constitution. This condition and the receipt of funds has to be acknowledged by AFCO. The Federal Government then requires an audited statement of expenditure for the previous financial year to be received by the Bureau before the balance of any funding for the coming year will be paid in order to be satisfied that expenditure has been in accordance with the grant condition.</PARA>

The advice generally suggests that the issues raised are internal to AFCO and generally technical rather than of substance. For the most part, the allegations by Dr Peters concern the internal workings of AFCO.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised that Counsel's advice concerning the constitutional irregularities referred to here by the honourable member was that they involved technicalities rather than matters of substance.

There is no suggestion to date that AFCO will be involved in extensive litigation because of those irregularities.

In a situation where there is already an oversupply of medical practitioners in Australia, the rapid entry of large numbers of doctors into the workforce would have a significant effect on health outlays.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) resolved on 6 November 1992 to introduce uniform legislation in all jurisdictions to ensure that domestic solid fuel heaters sold in Australia will comply with the April 1992 Australian Standards that refer to aspects of the performance of such appliances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Smoke is only one visible form of particulate matter. For compliance, an appliance without a catalytic combustor must have a maximum average rate of particulate emissions no greater than 5.5 grams per kilogram of fuel when tested as specified. Where an appliance is fitted with a catalytic combustor (which ensures more efficient combustion) the equivalent figure is no more than 3.0 grams per kilogram of fuel. The ANZECC resolution does not specify the date from which the legislation shall apply but the intention is that each jurisdiction will introduce legislation as quickly as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Each model of new domestic solid fuel heater will have to successfully pass a series of tests in one of two authorised laboratories before being granted a certificate of compliance.</PARA>

However, from information recorded by my Department, it is known that Australia was party to the European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention (No. 6 on the list) from 1958 to 1975 and that on 18 October 1988 the Government announced that Australia would not become a party to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (No. 81). More recently, the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime (No. 89) was signed for Australia, subject to ratification, on 28 September 1992 and a copy of the Convention was tabled in both Houses on 5 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the treaties focus on exclusively European concerns. Council of Europe listings indicate that only ten non-European states are currently parties to eleven different Council of Europe treaties and the maximum number of non-European parties to any one treaty is three. The Government is always prepared to consider becoming a party to such treaties when it is clearly in the national interest to do so. Indeed, in relation to the Money Laundering Convention mentioned above, Australia actively participated in the negotiation of the final text.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The 1991 Industry Commission report on energy generation and distribution recommended that "government policies that restrict the use of gas or its sale interstate or overseas he abolished", and that "the Commonwealth should consider using its powers, where relevant, to facilitate abolition of these restrictions." These issues were addressed in the National Gas Strategy, which I announced in Parliament on 28 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to interstate gas trade, I have sought, through the Australia and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council (ANZMEC), the commitment of all State and Territory Governments to the removal of impediments to free and fair interstate gas trade in order to ensure no constraints on gas finding new commercial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers attending the ANZMEC Meeting of 6 November 1992 agreed to continue working through ANZMEC, towards removing remaining impediments to interstate trade to provide a more open and competitive market place for natural gas, taking into account differences in structure of the gas industry in individual States. Ministers noted that the removal of impediments should provide incentives for the further development of Australia's natural gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step will be to identify the barriers and to consider appropriate action for their removal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Industry Commission report on energy generation and distribution indicated that new gas pipeline developments are best left to the private sector. The National Gas Strategy does not support a prescriptive approach to the development of gas infrastructure. Rather Federal Government policy is to remove impediments to gas trade, allowing market forces to determine the nature and timing of gas supply development and associated infrastructure requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent supply/demand study by the Australian Gas Association has provided a timely warning of the costs involved if the States and Territories prevent future free and fair interstate trade in gas. The study estimates that the cost to Australians of higher prices due to restricted interstate gas trade could, over the period until 2030, be as much as $4 billion, in current dollar terms. This study highlights the need for governments to take action now to remove impediments to free and fair interstate trade in gas.</PARA>
