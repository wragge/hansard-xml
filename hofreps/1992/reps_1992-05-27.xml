<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). I wish to add the following: my Department was not previously aware of the prospectus document compiled by Gregory Symons for a company called Unipac. It is in possession of a handout containing information on Unipac International&mdash;a university study centre. However, I am advised this morning that a copy of the prospectus is held in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the handout, it contains general information on the Marshall Islands, its history, et cetera and, in addition, it purports to be able to influence the entry of students to the USA via the Marshall Islands. The contents of the Unipac handout are specifically directed towards the entry of persons to the USA, and no mention is made of Australia or New Zealand. Preliminary inquiries in my Department's central, State and Suva offices reveal no record of any approaches or negotiations between Mr Symons, Unipac and the Department to facilitate student entry into Australia. I have requested that the Department continue its investigations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was also asked a question yesterday by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and I add the following: the business migration application of Chang Jin-Tso was assessed and approved in the Hong Kong office. The approving officer was satisfied that Chang Yung Tsong met the definition of dependant as laid out in the migration regulations. Claims by Multiplex in letters to Suva supporting a visitor visa for Mr Chang Yung Tsong were considered in assessing that application. That application was rejected by the assessing officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims made in that letter did not alter the fact that Chang Jr was still dependent on his father. I had requested my Department to review all the decisions involved to assure itself that they all met migration law and policy. The preliminary report of my Department is that they complied with that law and policy. The relevant files are now being sent to central office for further examination. My Department is investigating whether any parties to the various applications may have manipulated migration laws or other laws. This investigation will include the role of Multiplex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that Multiplex did not make representations in respect of the business migration application of Mr Chang Sr. The request for details of any reference or sponsorship by Multiplex of any migration application since 1985 is a request that will take some time and resources, if at all fully possible. I have requested my Department to provide as much detail as it can assemble as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a repeat of a very similar situation 12 months ago where, in the dying stages of Parliament, we had a guillotined debate, a very restricted time available for debate on one of the great Australian industries&mdash;the wool industry&mdash;at a time of particular difficulty for that industry. I accept that it is the greatest Australian industry in the history of this country and that a tax was to be imposed on it. It was also the baptism of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to primary industry. I think he had reason then to question some of the legislative and administrative problems that he had inherited from the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of these Bills today I think there will be further questioning by the Minister when I refer to the concept, procedures or arrangements for the annual meeting that he has been bequeathed again on this occasion. When we looked at the wool industry at that time, we saw that there was a stockpile of over 4.6 million bales, basically a year's production, and a debt of $2.8 billion. There was a debate as to what level of tax would apply to the woolgrowers of Australia who were looking forward to a significant reduction in their income because of the removal of the reserve price. They were suffering because of the drought that was then covering much of the wool-growing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was originally proposing a 15 per cent tax; the Opposition said that a 10 per cent tax was adequate to cover the situation. Finally, a 12 per cent compromise was reached in the Senate. At that time, in that compromise, some of the participants from the industry and the Australian Democrats were not aware that the Minister was going to reduce the promotion levy from 3 1/2 per cent, of that 12 per cent, to 2 1/2 per cent which, in turn, has now caused problems with finance for wool promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there was a very severe drought across much of Australia which, as was known at the time, has led to reduced production either directly because of the drought or indirectly because it was no longer of cost benefit to purchase the supplementary feed necessary to keep many of the sheep alive and producing. So for this financial year we now have a production of somewhere between 750 and 774 million kilograms of wool. That is well down from the record production of earlier times. There was also a situation where the wool textile pipeline&mdash;the wool going through the textile processing system&mdash;was basically empty because of the uncertainty that the wool textile industry was facing with regard to price and availability. Since that time there has been a better than anticipated clearance from the stockpile of about 100 million kilograms of wool. The debt reduction from the original $2.8 billion will certainly be under $2.4 billion by the end of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auction price has moved up and is very close to the 600c a kilogram. I commend the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for the way it has handled, with its policy, the disposal of the stockpile in that time. We now have the forecasts from the Australian Wool Corporation for the coming production year. It is saying that production will continue to fall to about 730 million kilograms and is anticipating that sales from the stockpile could be 50 per cent higher&mdash;that is, up to about 150 million kilograms of wool from about 100 million kilograms&mdash;for this current year. It is even estimating that the price will be slightly higher, at about 620c a kilogram clean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this means that, basically, the operating costs of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for storage, interest charges, and all other charges, of $374m, have been covered. The $20m initial debt repayment has been covered and there is about $300m left. In addition to that, in looking forward, the total costs will fall from $374m for this current year to about $260m next year. So if there is only a 2 per cent reduction in the total tax, which will cost about $54m, the Wool Realisation Commission already has enough to meet its costs for the coming year and it is already below the debt reduction requirement for 12 months time, which was $2.559 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add to that situation the levy income that will come in&mdash;whether the levy is set at 10 per cent, or some other figure&mdash;plus the big increase estimated in stockpile sales, we see that the wool industry is well on the way to once again being a proud industry. Debt will come down, as will the stockpile that has been overhanging the market. This was obvious as early as December last year when the Wool Council and the coalition parties indicated that three factors had to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there had to be greater flexibility in the debt repayment schedule, so that the earlier than anticipated debt reduction could be credited against later years; otherwise, the industry would be faced with the second best proposition of investing its surplus at a lower interest rate than it had been forced to pay through the outstanding debt. There was already apparent an ability to reduce the tax level for this coming year. The dramatic reduction in promotion funds meant that even with the reduced level of activity by the IWS&mdash;and many would say that it was time that the IWS had a good hard look at the scale and the cost benefit of its operations&mdash;it was not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's response came through the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in which the Government indicated that it had agreed to flexibility in the debt repayment schedule. I commend the Minister and the Government for that. I believe that is a very sensible situation. It is one of the points in this legislation. But at the same time in that statement there was the proposal to have a refund arrangement to take account of the surplus that had already been generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the industry and the coalition were quick to point out that, at a cost of several million dollars, it would be costly to administer; it would be a clumsy system. Anybody who has been involved with these systems before&mdash;whether in the wool industry, the horticultural industry or any other industry&mdash;knows that it would not be a clean thing administratively. There would be a delay in the delivery, and it would not maximise the benefit to the woolgrowers of Australia. When one considers that every one per cent reduction in that wool tax is worth about $1,000 to an average woolgrower with about 5,000 sheep, one can see that it is a significant factor in survival. Woolgrowers this financial year, according to the Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, will have a loss of $46,000&mdash;their worst year in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not unique in that sense, because all farmers are facing their worst year in the history of this country with every single category operating on a loss basis. But, unfortunately, woolgrowers are the worst affected with that mammoth figure. So anything that can be done to reduce their cost pressure is of value to their survival. Because of pressure and valid argument from the coalition parties and from the industry through the Wool Council, we now have a compromise in this legislation. We are having a refund when we are not having a refund, and we are having a tax reduction when we are not having a tax reduction. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say again that at least the Minister has been prepared to listen to commonsense on this basis. On the same basis of listening to commonsense, I put it to the Minister that there is absolutely no reason why the tax for the forthcoming year has to be any higher than 9 per cent because of those figures that have already been indicated, and because all the costs necessary for this coming year have already been covered. When one takes into account the projections of the Wool Corporation for the forthcoming year, one realises that even 9 per cent is a very safe and conservative figure, and that an even lower figure would be responsible. Some of the views put forward by members of the wool industry have indicated that much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Minister will be making this decision and the necessary regulation when he hears from the Wool Realisation Commission in June. I have no doubt that the AWRC will be very conservative. But the Minister must take into account the overall position of the industry and the advice received from the various sectors of the industry, knowing that he is maintaining the actual legislative level at 12 per cent, and therefore there is an ability to move. I remind the Minister to think very carefully about the future of the industry. I repeat that anything more than 9 per cent is completely unnecessary. At this time of great economic difficulty for woolgrowers, it is an unnecessary burden on their survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again point out to the Government and to the woolgrowers of Australia that if reducing costs is the most fundamental way of ensuring survival, the coalition's Fightback package is of value. Even the Minister has not disagreed with the Treasury calculation of a saving of over $1 billion a year to Australia's farmers. The figures we got from the Department are far more accurate than the Minister's off-the-cuff figures. There will be an average saving of over $8,000 per year per farmer, a tremendous saving to people who are hard pressed. The Treasury document, which is the Government's own document&mdash;it is not the Opposition's&mdash;shows that there would be further savings of $177m a year in the textile industry and $139m a year in the clothing and footwear industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is very keen on further processing, as is everybody else in primary industry, when it is sensible to do so and true value adding takes place. There is acknowledgment that early stage processing of wool is slowly but surely increasing with scouring and tops production. But there is only one way for it to develop, and that is to develop commercially, particularly when one considers that one of the newest investments in Western Australia is not operating at the present time. We look at the proposal by one of the biggest wool textile companies in the world, BWK, to invest in early stage processing&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has $135m in his textile fund to encourage, we are told, what is a very commercial and very profitable company, to give it some special encouragement to start here. In the long run, that would retard a sensible development of early stage processing, including tops-making, because a number of other companies want to either increase or start production. If we are going to have special deals for some, there is no way that we can have a straight commercial basis for the overall development of that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government wants to do something to encourage companies to develop on a commercial basis a higher percentage of early stage processing, it could find no better place to look than the Opposition's Fightback policy. The complete removal of payroll tax, fuel tax and sales tax, as indicated in the Government's own Treasury document, would effect savings of over $100m per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of this legislation makes some amendments&mdash;there are some other factors, but this is the important one&mdash;to the arrangements for the annual meeting. I acknowledge that the Minister had this Bill under way ahead of that meeting in early May, which indicates once again some of the unhappy legacies that he had to deal with and a recognition that it was not going to be the most successful annual general meeting that could take place. That has been proven to be the case, which is unfortunate. I believe that the new Wool Corporation has been doing a good job in restoring confidence in the industry. This has been an unfortunate and unnecessary blow to that rebuilding of credibility and confidence with regard to the peak industry organisational body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the changes are to allow registration for a three-year period. That seems to me to be sensible, because there were real problems with timing for the first AGM, when I think about 8,000 out of a potential 60,000 woolgrowers actually registered. There will be the opportunity for broader accountability in future AGMs beyond the restrictions to no confidence motions concerning the AWC and debate on the level of the wool tax. More general items to provide that broader accountability will be allowed. That seems to me to be sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly obvious from what I am saying that we are supporting this legislation. However, I question the cost benefit of the big PR-type annual meeting, which has been best, or worst, exemplified in the meat industry with the AMLC meeting. Although the wool one has not cost as much as that, there are claims that it has cost $400,000. I note that in a dairy industry Bill to be debated later today the Minister has not required the same concept, and that seems to me to be sensible. One should not be forcing some sort of overall model on all industries. I question whether or not what is being maintained in this legislation&mdash;that is, the single AGM-type meeting&mdash;is the best way to have accountability in the wool industry. There are a number of other ways of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way that seems worth investigating further&mdash;I have had some discussions with the industry, and I presume the Minister is having discussions with it also&mdash;is that, if we have only one meeting per year somewhere in Australia, because of the size of Australia we will have real problems in having an equitable spread of membership attending that meeting. Therefore, we will have great proxy battles. Smaller, less costly meetings in two or three geographical parts of Australia would seem to me to be an alternative that is at least worth further exploring. Unfortunately, because of the very severe guillotine that has been placed on this debate, and the limited opportunity that has been provided for others to speak, those are all of my comments, other than to say that the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wool package comprises seven Bills. The omnibus Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) includes amendments to the following Acts: the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964 and the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 5) of 1964. The main purpose of the package is to provide the mechanisms to make rebates of surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission funds. There are also some minor amendments to finetune the Acts in light of the experience with their administration over the past year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendment in regard to the Australian Wool Corporation Act is to enable wool tax payers to be registered for the purposes of the annual general meetings of the AWC and the Wool Research and Development Corporation for three years rather than the existing one year. There is another amendment in regard to clarifying the provisions concerning persons who may not be appointed members of the AWC so that members of the executives of peak national wool industry bodies are ineligible for appointment to the AWC Board. It will enable the possibility of an organisation other than the National Association of Testing Authorities to be the registering body for wool sampling sites, laboratories and show floors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 is to be amended to provide for the debt repayment schedule to be replaced on a cumulative basis. That is to enable the AWRC to carry over amounts repaid in excess of the current minimum annual repayments and to give the AWRC more flexibility in stockpile sales, especially in responding to downturns in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act is to be amended as a consequence of changes to the AWC Act to enable growers to register for AGMs for three years rather than annually as at present, since the AWC register is also used as the register for the WRDC AGMs. The changes to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 5) are to increase the maximum rate of wool tax on carpet wool from 4 to 6 per cent. Since carpet wool pays only the promotion and R&amp;D components of wool tax, and the combined rates voted on at the recent AGM exceed the current 4 per cent maximum, the carpet wool councils have requested that the maximum be increased to 6 per cent. The actual rate to apply, if lower than the maximum, will be set by regulation. The changes to the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964 enable persons liable to wool tax to remit to the Commonwealth the prescribed rate of wool tax less the rebate, if a rebate is declared, to complement the new rebate provisions in the AWRC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prices received for wool have been generally better than expected. The market indicator has ranged from 434c to 648c per kilogram this season, after closing at the end of the last season at about 598c. It is encouraging, given the tough times that our wool producers have gone through over the last few years. I think there is some encouragement on the horizon. With the better weather across this country I think we can have a bit more optimism in regard to the industry and the challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are some other speakers on this Bill today. Because of the guillotine I will conclude my remarks now to allow the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) to address these amendments. I think it is important that those honourable members who have indicated they wish to speak on this Bill can do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of wool tax Bills before the House&mdash;the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills, the Wool Tax (Administration) Amendment Bill and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;is important. It is certainly important to woolgrowers. It is a move in the right direction, a move that has much more support from the wool industry than the Government's first proposal in addressing the circumstances of the substantially reduced debt of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, resulting from much more substantial sales and at better prices than were anticipated at the time the original legislation was brought into this Parliament after the demise of the previous wool marketing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it should be on the record that the Opposition is now in the position of saying, `We told you so'. The simple fact is that at that time the Opposition campaigned for a 10 per cent tax overall. I think history is now proving us to be the better judges and more confident in our wool industry than the Government is. But that is behind us. The current proposal creates a mechanism whereby on an annual basis the Government can reset the wool tax to reflect the previous year's marketing. It is a compromise between the Government's original position and the wool industry's position. My advice from wool industry people is that they are satisfied with that and, as a consequence, it has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moves as yet have not clearly defined how future tax may be split up. In the original proposals a 3.5 per cent promotion levy was reduced to 2.5 per cent in the construction of the original 12 per cent tax. That was a response to the ability of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to reduce the tax from 15 per cent to 12 per cent, and it is now to be lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard all the arguments for promotion. Recently I took the opportunity to travel to Japan, in particular Osaka, and to South Korea, particularly Taegu, and asked people at the coalface, if you like, of the wool industry what their opinion was on its future and certain aspects of the industry as it is promoted in Australia by the various wool industry bodies. It was interesting to me that when technicians in the fourth biggest weaving and spinning mill in the world at Taegu in South Korea were asked what they thought of the current campaign in Australia for length and strength testing, they shrugged their shoulders and said, `If you provide it, we'll use it. But as professionals in the wool industry we make our own adjustments in that regard'. Those aspects should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial amount of promotion also seemed to be taking place. I had interesting discussions with various people associated with the International Wool Secretariat and was impressed by their enthusiasm. I was also impressed by the quality of their office space and the views across Hong Kong harbour. I am sure that we could get equal effort from less expensive office space but, in general, I accept the role of promotion. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned that at no time will this promotion be allowed to reach the levels of excesses, or fat, that I think occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Mr Excell, the new managing director or senior executive of the IWS, has been out here explaining to us how we are being taken over. His one-liner seems to be that the doona filled with synthetic product has replaced the blanket. All this happened while we were spending $200m-plus a year on promotion. There seems to be some contradiction in his argument that we have to spend more because that happened. It occurred when we were spending a fortune. It is evident that those people were taking woolgrowers' money&mdash;I am categorised in that group&mdash;and not protecting them from synthetic doona filling. It is fortunate, but probably a little late, that CSIRO&mdash;as I have reminded this Parliament time and again&mdash;has now come up with a wool filler product which I can testify is excellent and should be able to establish itself in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add&mdash;I have already put it on the record&mdash;because it is worth while in terms of value adding, that Coles Fosseys sent me a new doona the other day for road testing and I am doing that. It is one that the company has manufactured to meet its particular market&mdash;a cheaper product. It appears excellent and I congratulate the company on its initiative. When I first discovered that CSIRO had come up with this excellent doona filling material, which is made of wool and polyester&mdash;the polyester is there to improve the product, not to lower its cost; it stops the product from felting down&mdash;I found that most of our major retailers were not stocking the product. My correspondence has encouraged them to do so, but Coles warrants special mention because, having had a look at the product and having realised that it could not market it at the price, it manufactured one specially that meets its price constraints. The company is to be congratulated on that. Having tried out the product, I can say that it is certainly keeping me warm at home. Australians should acknowledge that such products are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promotion is something that we read about in the newspapers and is being provided in Australia by private enterprise. Nevertheless, the recent advertisements by the Australian Wool Corporation, which commenced on National Wool Day, are excellent. I think the advertisements have struck a cord because they promote Australian wool as a product which is not a chemical product. Considering the views, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, concerning chemicals these days and the resulting pollution, we have a great opportunity to market wool as something very special. I congratulate the Corporation on its initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I raise the caution that, as politicians, we are still to learn that throwing money at something does not necessarily solve the problem. As to the industry's demands for more money&mdash;as a woolgrower, I would give it more money&mdash;I expect to see performance. To stand up and say, `Well, during the period we failed you gave us twice as much as we get now, and that is why you should give us more money' is a very poor argument. I would like Mr Excell to adjust his rhetoric because I do not think it is a convincing argument. Nevertheless, I do not think any member of this Parliament stands away from the fact that part of the levy that must be imposed on wool growers is a contribution to promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a substantial role for promotion by those who manufacture wool product. When I read about cotton in Australia I usually find that it is some jeans manufacturer or company of that kind which is promoting the product because it is fundamental to that company's product. We must encourage that at all times. After all, people do not buy wool; they buy woollen clothing, woollen blankets or other products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Wool Realisation Commission has achieved outstanding sales and this is very encouraging. The Commission seems to have been able to achieve that with a limited effect on the market; the market has risen. There was a bit of a blurp and a fright when it got a little higher than anticipated and then, through some actions which were not very smart, particularly the one allowing too much wool to come onto a couple of sales, the price fell, but it has now stabilised. Whether woolgrowers like it or not, if we are to re-establish our product on the market we will have to look at something like a price indicator of 600c for some time to come. It is time&mdash;and I think it represents a challenge&mdash;for the Wool Corporation to sit down and advise our industry of the price at which the world will buy our product. That will be information that some people will not want to hear but, if it is 700c, the simple message to some is this: do not grow it; look for alternatives. I have a farm in an area which has traditionally been a fat lamb producing area. I cannot grow them at a profit and I told my manager the other day to get rid of those Dorset Horn rams; I do not want them on the property any more. I would rather not bother because for me they are not profitable. It is my job as a farmer to find something that is profitable, even in tough times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the world demands that we produce wool in the near future at a market indicator of around 700c there will be some woolgrowers who can produce at that and those are the ones that will have to do so. Obviously we would like more to do that. One of the ways over time that that economy will be achieved is when the industry also understands that it is impossible for it to continue to pay the prices for land that it has in the past. Australian land is simply not worth the price that farmers have paid for it and it is a significant aspect of their costs. That is a terrible message for the bloke who has already paid it and either has a debt or is sitting on that land. But they are all aspects of meeting the price that the world will pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit told me that in both Japan and Korea they are anticipating a 20 per cent increase by volume in their purchases. But, of course, the other fact of life is that they will also be affected by the price. I asked them what was the optimum price and their answer to me was, `Well, what can your farmers afford to produce it at?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to contribute a few words on the Wool Tax (Administration) Amendment Bill in the limited time left. I want to caution the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) about the overall tax levels for the coming 12 months because he has an enormous responsibility resting on his shoulders when he ultimately determines and is given the power to regulate the wool tax for the coming 12 months given all that has happened in the past 12 months. Whilst seasons may have turned for some woolgrowers across Australia, there are still a large number of producers forced to feed sheep and who are in a critical situation. So the lower that the Minister can make that tax quite responsibly this year the better it will be. Albeit that they may be very small gains, every dollar will be greatly appreciated by those out there in rural Australia in a critical situation in the coming 12 months, particularly the woolgrowers. The measure will certainly be supported from this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, though, that the 4 per cent figure proposed for promotion in the coming 12 months is a sensible one. Unfortunately, it is necessary this year to raise the promotion level to beyond what it could have been had the Minister not intervened last year and forced the industry to take only 2 1/2 per cent for promotion. In any industry&mdash;I am sure the Minister does understand this&mdash;where one has a problem selling one's product because of the events of the previous 12 months and the collapse of the reserve price scheme, promotion is extremely important. One just cannot sell a product without promotion, and promotion internationally is extremely expensive. This year the industry is forced to increase the tax above the level that it would have liked. Had it been able to have the tax that it proposed for promotion last year of 3 1/2 per cent, the increase would not have had to be so great this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at what research money does and how it is spent. The dividend, if one likes, that is paid to the woolgrowers from that research money of one half of one per cent benefits not just the woolgrowers but all Australians. A paper was recently put out by ABARE on the dividend that is paid really as a result of that research. The money spent by CSIRO on Sirospun has been extremely well spent. I think there is a factor of about 10:1 in terms of the dividend paid from that research money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other aspect that I would like to touch on. In the intervening period between the last sitting fortnight and this sitting fortnight, I spent a few days in Russia.

While I was in Moscow I had some very good discussions with the International Wool Secretariat and with Austrade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will just take the opportunity to respond to a couple of points that have been made in the debate. The first is that I do accept the comments that have been made not only by the other side of the House but indeed by me. I do see it as very important that we seek, against the background of prudentially continuing to manage the stockpile, to try to get as much back to woolgrowers at this time in the rebuilding process as is possible. I happen to believe that there is a great future for wool in this country; I made this point when I opened National Wool Day in this Parliament a month or so back. We are uniquely placed because we do have significant moneys in the rural adjustment scheme. Optimism has returned with the prices, the breaking of the drought substantially, the greater certainty and the preparedness for investment in tops-making beyond the scouring processing for which there is an overcapacity. But there is not overcapacity given the new demand and the strategic linkage that Australia can provide in the wool chain as a top supplier to an Asian market that is increasingly coming on stream where it can provide the spinning and weaving dimension with our providing the tops dimension. So I am keen to see that develop and not to restrict entry to simply one company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on record as saying that the approaches through the TCFDA have to be transparent, they have to be available to all comers and they cannot be selective. There is a great opportunity. The rural adjustment scheme provides the basis for restructuring not just the wool industry but others in the farm sector, and I think we have to capitalise on that. I happen to believe that the capital base has been run down in the major industries. If we can reduce costs and returns to the growers, it will be an important impetus to enable them to rebuild that capital base. So I am convinced that what we have to do is to try to get back as much as is possible. This legislation gives us the flexibility to do that based upon performance. That performance has been achieved. The extent of that performance judged against prudential management is still a matter that I have to consider in the next couple of weeks, but I will be continuing to talk with the wool industry about the most appropriate outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make just briefly relates to the question of promotion. I do not accept that the decision that I took last time to limit the amount spent on promotion at 2 1/2 per cent has seen a diminution in promotion by the Australian Wool Corporation. The Wool Corporation had in fact substantial reserves and it accepted when I made the 2 1/2 per cent decision that, provided it did not last for longer than a year, it could manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other discipline that the cutting of promotion at that time had was to cause a fundamental rethink in the International Wool Secretariat. I, too, have had a number of important discussions with it and I am impressed by the direction that it is now pursuing. It is a much leaner and more market oriented organisation than it was and that is an important portent of things to come. The industry has to become market driven. It has to understand the significance of quality and service through the wool pipeline. It has to meet market demands. It cannot simply continue to be a supply driven dimension; that, I think, has been the reason that the industry has not prospered as strongly as it could have in the past. So, whilst I have taken notice of the decisions that have been taken at those meetings of the wool industry, I will be talking to the industry about its recommendations. I see promotion as fundamental to the future of the industry and I have made a commitment that I will not take any decisions which it could be argued would limit the capacity for it to promote. There is a great future for this industry, and this legislation will help it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate I represent the Opposition's view on the part of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill that deals with shipping. This Bill is very broad in nature. It does not deal just with transport and shipping issues, it deals also with communications and aviation matters. My colleagues the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) will speak in relation to their shadow portfolios in those areas following my contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address the amendments to the shipping and maritime aspects of the Bill. In passing, I just make reference to the fact that the Government's guillotine limits the opportunity and the time available for members of the House of Representatives to address concerns that they believe are important. This Government is totally and utterly incapable of managing the affairs of the House of Representatives. We have seen the guillotine applied by this Government more times than the total recorded in the rest of the history of the Federal Parliament. It just goes to show that not only can it not run the economy, not only can it not create jobs for people throughout Australia, but also it cannot even get down to the business of properly managing the affairs of the House of Representatives so as to ensure that members have the opportunity to speak for a proper amount of time on subjects that they believe it is important to raise in order to represent the best interests of their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is not of a particularly controversial nature from the point of view of either the industry or the members of the Federal coalition. It deals with a number of amendments which we judge to be worthy of support. For example, the first aspect of the Bill that attracts my interest is an amendment to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990. It allows the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to provide services on a commercial basis to the Commonwealth, the States, the ACT and the Northern Territory. This ensures that any demands that are placed by either the Commonwealth, the States or the Territories on AMSA's services can be charged out to those governments on a full commercial basis so that AMSA is not subsidising Commonwealth departmental activities or, indeed, State or Territory government activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because plenty of funds will be available, AMSA will be able to focus solely on providing the search and rescue and other maritime safety activities around Australia for ordinary citizens who get lost at sea. It also ensures the provision of services to commercial and recreational shipping so that those two areas do not feel that, through the payment of costs and fees, they are subsidising government departments at either the State or Federal level. This is something we can support. Indeed, we would support the further commercialisation of AMSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time in the past the Opposition has said that there are certain aspects of the activities of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority which can be fully commercialised and, indeed, privatised. There is no reason at all why some of AMSA's activities cannot be privatised. We have indicated that, when in government after the next election, we will be moving in this direction. We will ensure that those who have a proper responsibility to pay for the search and rescue and other safety activities of AMSA will pay for them. That will enable the Commonwealth to focus its funding on those areas that are of a community service obligation nature, such as search and rescue operations for people lost at sea. This will ensure that we have more resources to carry out that very important task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the legislation is a very minor amendment to the Navigation Act 1912. It corrects what was a very basic drafting error. It is sloppy drafting, and the Department of Transport and Communications can be properly criticised&mdash;indeed, constructively criticised&mdash;for what was a very poor bit of drafting. Instead of using the word `industrial' in the Bill when it was first presented and passed through this Parliament, the Government now wishes to change that word to international. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not have any great bearing on the nature of the Bill; it simply highlights the importance of having Bills properly drafted and properly checked before they come to the Parliament. Every time an amendment is required to correct a drafting error, it costs many thousands of dollars, takes up the time of this Parliament and creates unnecessary work and expense that could otherwise be directed towards better government. I just make the point that the Department has not acted as professionally as it could have and needs to correct itself in this area in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other, and probably more important, aspects of the legislation deal with the Protection of Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1991. They deal with environmentally hazardous chemicals carried on board vessels around Australian waters. We are all very much aware of the need to protect Australia's waters against oil spills and chemical spills that can occur from a ship in one way or another. A ship can break up, as was the case with the recent sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coastline when the bow simply broke off the ship and the oil spilled into the ocean or, as with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> off the coast of the United States, a ship can run aground, hit a rock and split open, resulting in an oil spill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two recent and well-known examples of how very environmentally damaging activities can occur at sea. This amendment to the legislation deals in a better and a more comprehensive way with widening the range of chemicals and other hazardous objects carried on board ships. It ensures that the list is kept up to date with the latest changes in technology and the types of chemicals that are being transported around the world by ships. It ensures that for every hazardous chemical carried on board a ship a proper safety program is available and a proper communications system is in operation to ensure that if any of these chemicals are spilled, either because of a ship breaking up or hitting a rock or because of sloppy handling in a port, the proper procedures are in place so that those chemical spills are reported correctly and that the correct procedures are enacted to ensure that damage to the environment is minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Opposition supports this amendment. For several years we have been very supportive of any reasonable move to minimise any potential environmental damage that may occur in our maritime environment. I note that the former Minister for Shipping and Aviation, Senator Collins&mdash;who was appointed to the Cabinet yesterday and whose shipping and waterfront responsibilities have been transferred to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook&mdash;has often been critical of the Opposition, saying that it stands for polluting the environment and all these dastardly things. Of course, as is so often the case, Senator Collins was exaggerating and not being fair, accurate or correct in his representation of Opposition policy or intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many of these areas of maritime safety and maritime environmental protection the Opposition has been as good as, if not better than, the Government in promoting the cause of environmental protection in our maritime environment. In this instance we again support wholeheartedly the amendment that we believe better protects our maritime environment, and we will continue to support any other issue we believe is important to environmental protection of our maritime areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next aspect also deals with the protection of our maritime environment. It particularly deals with the protocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Australia has a very significant involvement in the Antarctic. We have a very important responsibility to fulfil there. We and the Government are proposing in the amendment to further the environmental protection of the Antarctic area by ensuring that all ships that enter Australian waters in the Antactic, whether signatories to the MARPOL agreements or not, are made to deal properly with the treatment of sewage to ensure that sewage is just not haphazardly dumped in that area, and by ensuring that any chemicals or hazardous materials which are spilt, or which may have the potential to be spilt into the Antarctic environment, are handled in a proper and responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will extend our powers in that area and will provide fines of up to $200,000 to ensure that ships that do not fly the flag of a signatory to the MARPOL agreements come within the responsibilities of proper legislation and proper activities in the Antarctic area. Once again, the Opposition wholeheartedly supports this particular aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect that we would like to raise has been brought to our attention by the Australian National Maritime Association, a very responsible and professional group of people who represent the shipowners of Australia. I would like to take the opportunity today to draw this matter to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, and to the attention of the departmental officials in the advisers booth. The association has said that, whilst it supports all the Government's proposals in this area, there is a need to take into account the provision of safe ports around the Australian coastline for ships that have a problem, be it the spillage of oil or some other hazardous chemical. It makes the point that there are many occasions when a ship may be leaking oil, or leaking some hazardous material, and the best way to deal with the problem would be to have that ship sail into a port, be it under tow or under its own steam, to have those dangerous chemicals, oil, or whatever it may be, pumped off the ship into safe storage on land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very sensible way of addressing the problem of the spillage of oil or other chemicals at sea; indeed, it could limit the damage to the environment. We need to have a proper strategy in place to ensure that we have safe ports so that if a ship strikes a problem of this nature it can sail into the port, secure in the knowledge that proper procedures are in place to deal with any environmental damage, and store those environmentally damaging chemicals, oils, or whatever they may be, so that we can minimise the damage to our environment. ANMA has made that plea. On behalf of ANMA and the shipowners and operators of Australia I extend that plea to the Government: we need to have in place safe ports where vessels in distress can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to ensure the availability of tugs to take the vessels into the ports if they cannot get there under their own steam. For example, they could have been damaged in a storm, they could have struck rocks and lost a propeller, or their engines could have failed. This is something, I believe, which is very important. It is an issue which will become more important over the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world shipping fleet is getting older. Because of the age of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, sheer metal failure led to the bow breaking off and this will occur more often in the future. I expect, and look forward to, further legislation coming into this Parliament which will ensure that maritime environmental protection will be properly addressed. I can assure the Government and the industry that we will support any reasonable measure to safely protect the maritime environment for future generations of Australians.</PARA>

I think the Indian Ocean area comes into his jurisdiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very pleasant part of the country. It looks like philatelic sales will probably go up in that area as well. The second area relates to the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991. An important amendment there is made to protect the name and symbol of Austel, the independent regulator of telecommunications. There have been recent examples where, we assume unwittingly, people have been using that particular name for commercial advantage, and that should not continue. That is why that amendment is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some amendments relating to the international transit arrangements for the carriage of services. More importantly, there is an amendment that enables AOTC, the dominant carrier, which superseded Telecom&mdash;we now have a combined Telecom and OTC&mdash;to discriminate between customers in setting prices. It provides the opportunity for concessions to be made to pensioners. The details of those concessions have already been announced. It is important that people in our community who are users of telecommunications services, and who are on very low or fixed incomes, have the benefit, and this amendment enables that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive changes that are being made in the Telecom area are impacting on all levels of the community, not the least of which is the employment levels within Telecom. Some concerns have been expressed in Canberra in recent days. I say to the residents of Canberra that they are not the only residents in Australia who are seeing the changes that are taking place in telecommunications. I was in Warrnambool in Victoria recently and saw changes there. Being Tasmanian, I have seen changes in Tasmania. These changes will have to be made if we are to be serious about addressing the broader benefits that will flow from growth in the telecommunications market and the new competitive arrangements that have been supported by both sides of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government has to ask itself about the long term policy implications that flow from the necessary commercial charter that it has given Telecom. It would not be happening in the way that it is, and there would not be concern in the community about job dislocation that is taking place, if we were not in the middle of a recession. We all recognise that there has to be this change. When this happens, there will always be human costs. I think Telecom management is doing the best it can, but it is charged with carrying out a policy that the Government has given it. There would not be the disquiet to the extent there is in the community about the necessary changes, engaging the new technologies that are available and that we ought to be taking part in, if we were not in the middle of a recession that is biting so many people so hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the amendment to make sure that the pensioners of Australia get the benefits that we think they should get. But we also support the continuation of the change that ought to be taking place in telecommunications. This has been delayed for too long. Perhaps if we had been making changes in telecommunications over a slightly longer period, rather than trying to rush them through in the way that the Government has had to do, the impact on so many employees would not have been so severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that in the changes which are taking place we ought to be as generous as is possible to those employees in terms of additional training. I think AOTC is trying to do that. But they are issues which the Government must address. Many communities throughout Australia are asking the question and are not receiving any answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it would be an opportune time to pose a challenge to the new Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, who has been appointed and formally takes up his position today. I congratulate him and welcome him to the portfolio. I think he is the fourth Minister that I have shadowed in this area in about 12 months. I hope that he will stay there at least until the election. In any event, he is charged with a very weighty responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most people would recognise that telecommunications services and broadcast services touch each and every family in this community. So the decisions that the Government makes about these areas are indeed important. They need to be thought through very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters we are debating here today relates to the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill. As I understand it, we are debating these Bills cognately. I indicate, on behalf of the Opposition, that we also support that Bill. That Bill puts in place a charging regime for the new mobile telephone service that is to be offered for sale. At the present time, we have Optus Communications which will be the alternative telephone company in this country. It will provide a mobile service. We also have the existing AOTC service, which is called Mobilenet. The Government proposes to issue a third licence to commence in 1995 and this Bill sets up a charging regime for the licence. This is a very valuable licence which will be bid for&mdash;and I stress that point&mdash;by competing consortia to be the third mobile carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the figures that the only area of rapid growth in telephone-type services in the country at the present time&mdash;given that we are in the middle of a recession&mdash;is that of mobile telephones. Even growth in that area has slowed down a little. It is interesting to note that in our Party room only this week we had an example of the pervasiveness of mobile telephones. A member who was sitting in the room had a mobile telephone and it actually rang. We did not know whether this was the latest way of disseminating information out of party rooms&mdash;of course it was not&mdash;but it did strike a chord with all of my colleagues to the effect that mobile telephones are now becoming far more prevalent. They are part of what is happening in telecommunications. Greater convenience and greater efficiency in telecommunications is what we want to foster in this country, and utilising this technology in the best way possible is what we want to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is important. Interestingly, it follows the coalition's policy, which has long been to support the concept of a third mobile licence because we believe there ought to be competition, as much as possible, among these services. The Australian Telecommunication Authority, Austel, to which I referred earlier, completed a report in July last year about the mobile services and the need for a third mobile licence. That report was released in only April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there was some nervousness on the part of the Government as to whether or not it ought to have released the report which recommended a third mobile licence. The Government held it back and it has been very nervous about embracing competition and giving the Australian community the opportunity to have a competing range of services. I suppose the Government should be congratulated on finally having crossed the line, but I expressed some concern earlier about the fact that it held back the Austel report for so long when it really confirmed what ought to have happened and what has now finally happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe it is worth making some comment about the whole process of the selection of the mobile licensee. Whilst we want it to take place, we stress that it must be open: the whole process must be transparent. The Opposition wants to see, the community needs to see and particularly I in my office want to see a totally transparent arrangement. We do not believe the awarding of these licences ought to be done in other than an open manner. I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, to make sure that we are kept fully informed about the major changes that are being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The licence will be issued in a way which takes account of the experience and financial strength of the potential bidders, industry plans, development commitments and Australian equity participation. All of those matters are indeed important, but at the end of the day we want a service which will be sustainable, truly competitive and benefit all of us in this country. That ought to be the outcome that each and every one of us seeks in this particular area, complicated as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, we support these two Bills. I take the opportunity to say that I understand that the amendments&mdash;I have just been handed a copy of them&mdash;are minor in relation to the main points that are made in the legislation. As far as I can see, we do not have any concerns about those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem is developing in this chamber, which I spoke about yesterday. I think it is incumbent upon those of us who are concerned about the method by which legislation is rushed through the House to raise this matter when we have the opportunity to do so. These Bills are important Bills. They propose major changes and new services in telecommunications. Yet we are here today debating them under time constraints. Many of my colleagues will not have the opportunity to speak, which I think is regrettable, and people on the other side of the chamber will not have the opportunity to speak. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is less regrettable. In any event, I make the point that I had to receive a briefing on one of these Bills from departmental people by way of a telephone conference. I was quite happy to do that because I have a lot of respect for those people and I have been dealing with them for some time. But I do not think that is the appropriate way in which we ought to be preparing for legislation. We have some amendments and there has not been much time to consider them in detail. If we are going to have the process of legislation by exhaustion&mdash;sitting until midnight every night and rushing through Bills without deep consideration&mdash;we will make mistakes. All we do is compound the errors because governments come back here with further amendments to pick up anomalies, drafting errors or oversights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the processes in this chamber are designed to improve legislation. We did this admirably with the telecommunications legislation last year. We went through a lengthy parliamentary process and we got a better piece of legislation for it. So I make this appeal to the Government and, particularly, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). It is incumbent upon him to have a more measured program which facilitates a wider and more lengthy debate. It is not just a matter of his coming in here, dishing it up and shoving it down our throats; that is not acceptable. That is why on each and every occasion we will protest, and protest strongly, because we do not get the good legislation that the nation deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by asking the new Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, to make clear at the earliest possible time what he is proposing with regard to broadcast legislation. We have been waiting for a long time to see broadcast legislation revisited in this country. The Government had a proposed Bill, for the first time in 50 years, and it has been redrawn. I do not know, as I stand here today at the dispatch box, what the Government's intentions are. I have received some information and briefings from departmental people. Obviously, with a new Minister&mdash;the fourth Minister in 12 months&mdash;there will be a revisiting of some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to pay television, it needs to be made clear that the moratorium ends on 31 October-1 November. We need to know exactly what is proposed. The legislative program is about to be completed. Senator Collins needs to make a clear statement early on so that everyone, both in the Opposition and elsewhere, knows exactly what the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use something which fell out of my newspaper this morning to make this point. Newsvision is starting in Australia. The technology that is driving change in this particular area has to be recognised. Whilst we will all have some debate about how we address those problems, we have to make sure that legislation is technologically neutral, facilitates the march of technology and does not constrain it. If we are going to hold up the whole process because of our inability and the Government's inability to determine where and when it is going, then we, the Australian people and consumers, will be the losers. They are the very people who ought not to be the losers; they ought to be the winners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Government to try to get its house in order as quickly as it can. It is getting good advice. It has good people there who are giving good advice&mdash;and, of course, we are not always going to agree with it. But the Government now has a new Minister for Transport and Communications, and it has to let us know, let the community know, and let the industry know where it is going. Any further delay, procrastination and political game playing is simply not satisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I would like to pick up a couple of comments made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and also the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). First of all, can I thank the honourable member for Bass for taking his turn in the way that he did. I am sorry he was caught short; so was I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points I want to pick up before I go to the legislation. If those opposite are going to wander around the nation making the point&mdash;and it is a valid point&mdash;that there have been some changes in the Ministry and that the new Minister for Transport and Communications is the fourth Minister that the honourable member for Bass has had in his time in the shadow portfolio, he should not repeat the claim that he just made, because it was absolutely wrong. The honourable member has exaggerated it by 25 per cent. He said that this was his fourth Minister in 12 months. It is only the third. Mr Beazley was there for 2 1/2 years, Senator Richardson was there for a few months, and now Senator Collins will be there for the duration. So he should at least keep it square, because we have to deal with these exaggerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I do not think it is fair for the honourable member to come into the chamber and complain about the Government guillotining the legislation and imposing the time constraints within which we deal with it. I say that for two reasons. Those opposite understand very well why we are on this legislative timetable. It is because the Senate, which is controlled by the Opposition and the Democrats, has laid down the legislative timetable. It has said that it will not deal with legislation that comes across from this chamber after this week, and those opposite know that very well. This is important legislation, and if honourable members opposite want more time to spend on it&mdash;I would like to spend more time on it; we would all like to spend more time on it&mdash;they only have to direct their senators to give the debate a bit of time in the Senate. So it is entirely up to those opposite, and it is not reasonable to come in here and complain about the guillotine when their people are driving the timetable in the other House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to some of the aspects of this legislation. As the honourable member for Bass indicated, those opposite are not opposing it; they are in fact supporting it. In many areas of transport and communications reform we have had quite a degree of unanimity between the Opposition and ourselves because we all understand the directions in which these industries have to go. We all understand that technology is driving us in some of the areas, and we all understand that the timetable has to be moved along. But remember, too, that it is the Opposition that is claiming that the reform process is not happening quickly enough. I am saying that the legislation has to keep pace with the reform process. Major structural changes have taken place and this legislation is now reflecting them. Decisions that have been taken and announced and will be falling into place are reflected in this legislation. So it is necessary to deal very quickly with the legislation to make it possible to do the things that we all agree have to be done. We have common ground on many of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quickly go through some of the aspects of the dramatic reforms in the Australian economy that are reflected in this legislation. Real reforms have taken place since the return of the Government in March 1990. Real reforms have taken place which are not just things that have occurred during these two years; they are things that in some cases have been waiting 90 years to happen&mdash;90 years when there was plenty of opportunity for earlier governments to tackle them. All of a sudden they have been taken on and moved along at a dramatic pace by this Government. It is totally unreasonable to make the claim that the reform process is not happening fast enough. In fact, it is happening so quickly that many Australians cannot understand it and many Australians are uncomfortable with it. But we in this place know that, given the internationalisation of our economy and the adoption of principles such as world best practice, we cannot afford to slow that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, I refer to the reform that has taken place on the waterfront. The honourable member for Gilmore makes great play of wandering around to the rural constituency in particular and promoting visions of things that take place on the waterfront that are at least five years out of date. I noticed an article published in the daily shipping publication where John Spiers, one of the very respected writers in the industry, makes exactly this point: those on the other side are now, for electoral opportunism, purveying myths&mdash;myths that containers do not move on the waterfront; myths that the wharfies lose stuff, and all this kind of thing; myths that we still have to get rid of all this labour on the waterfront. The fact is that we are now at the point where the stevedoring companies are saying to the Government that they need to employ new people, particularly new people who can keep pace with the technological changes that are taking place in the handling of transport equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of interest, the Opposition makes enormous play of the waterfront as the area of reform that is needed in this economy. The Industry Commission analysed the waterfront last year&mdash;it was actually 18 months ago now, at the start of this process&mdash;and indicated that it was a $1 billion per annum problem for the Australian economy; there were $1 billion worth of inefficiencies in the system. The same Industry Commission analysis assessed the road-rail imbalance, the misuse of road transport as against rail transport in this country, and drew a conclusion that that was a $8 billion problem. In other words, it was eight times the problem of the waterfront in this country, caused by a dilapidated rail structure and misinvestment of funds to encourage road transport in areas where rail transport was clearly the desired form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major reforms have taken place in the past two years in road and rail transport. As a matter of interest, I would suggest that the most glaring example of this imbalance used to be the 2,000 trucks a day driving up and down the Hume Highway parallel to a standard gauge railway line carrying containers. If we have a look at the Hume Highway now,  we will see that there are not nearly as many trucks on it, but the trucks that are on it are specialist transport vehicles. The containers are in fact on the rail. There has been a major shift. That is the way it should be, for a whole lot of reasons to which most Australians continually point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reforms are taking place. The most dramatic reform of the lot has been the formation of the National Rail Corporation; the bringing together of the States to agree to the principle that we will abandon four different State railway systems and three different railway gauges. We will cooperate in the formation of a National Rail Corporation and we will finally build the standard gauge rail between Brisbane and Sydney and between Adelaide and Melbourne to give Australia one standard rail freight system from Perth through Melbourne to Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes do not take place just in a vacuum; they take place under a government that is prepared to, first, commit funds to public sector expenditure&mdash;and I want to come to this point in a minute&mdash;and, second, say to industry, `This has to be done sensibly and this is how it is going to happen'. Those changes are falling in place dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn quickly to the issue of AOTC and the opening up of Australia's telephone network to competition. We all understand that our major telecommunications provider, Telecom, needed an injection of competition to make it more sensitive to customer requirements and to gear it up for a much expanded international role. The Government chose to do that by merging OTC and Telecom into the new AOTC and introducing a competitor in the form of Optus. For the first time in 90 years in this country, the communications system has been opened up for challenge. It is a dramatic change. It is a difficult change for the 80,000 Telecom employees to accept. They are working their way through these processes. The new board of AOTC, under the new Chief General Manager, Mr Frank Blount, has developed a business plan by which it will approach the competition. It is well aware that the new communications competitor, Optus, will win a share of the market and it is well aware that its capacity to retain market share will be based particularly on customer service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employees of AOTC, as it is now called, have a very big charter before them, that is, to be part of an organisation which is dramatically changing. It is under a price cap. We as a government are not lifting the price cap regime. We are allowing, as this legislation provides, for some liberalisation of the tariff structures so that AOTC can respond to changes that come through competition. The overall price cap of inflation minus four, I think it is at the moment, remains intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very interesting challenge that AOTC faces in a low inflation economy. When inflation was running at 6 or 7 per cent, we set Telecom, as it was in those days, a pricing regime whereby its prices had to reduce in real terms; they had to be the inflation rate minus a factor of two, three or four. That is still in place at a time when inflation in the economy has fallen to below 2 per cent. That means that the pricing regime, the revenue from call charges, has to go backwards in real terms. That is a real challenge for an organisation which has been through a lot of change and a lot of discipline from the Government as its shareholder&mdash;discipline which came with the election of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are many areas on which we have common ground. Were there more time to peruse the legislation in the way that the honourable member for Bass would like, I am sure there would not be all that much that we would be at odds on, as he understands. However, there is an area where there will be considerable difference between the Government and the Opposition as we move a little further down the track, that is, the future of these organisations&mdash;whether they remain in public ownership, whether the Government and the people of Australia continue to own them, or whether we move down the Opposition's road of flogging them off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. Is the honourable member for Bass offended by the term `flogging them off'? Would he like me to rephrase that? There is no need for him to interject again. He would like me to say `the Opposition's plan to offer them for sale to whoever'. That is undefined; it could be foreigners or whoever. `To offer them for sale' is a nice parliamentary way of saying `flogging them off'. I think I refer to it in a way that most Australians understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that there will be a very major debate over the issue of privatisation of organisations such as Telecom, Australia Post, our airports, the Commonwealth Bank and many other public assets that many of us will argue should stay in public ownership because they are performing well; they are now operating under a commercial structure and providing the dividends that the taxpayer is entitled to receive from them. That will be a debate. I know where the Australian public will be when we get to the end of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a big difference&mdash;and it is interesting that I relate this to transport&mdash;in the area of pricing structure. The difference in pricing structure comes through the issue of the proposed goods and services tax, the GST. I have not yet found a tourist organisation or a tourist operator&mdash;perhaps the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) will be able to tell me when he speaks&mdash;who thinks it is a wonderful idea that there will be a 15 per cent increase on air fares, hotel rooms, motel rooms, meals and all the other things that are associated with the tourism industry, which,  of course, is so dependent on the transport sector. That is one little factor where there will be a difference. When we talk about the price cap on AOTC and on the charging for telecommunications, in comes a nice little 15 per cent consumption tax on one's phone bill. The effect of that has to go into the inflation factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was thinking about the claim that the Opposition will abolish seven taxes and have just one big tax, I was thinking in terms of the ordinary football fan who uses our transport services to go to the football. In Melbourne that person will have seven new taxes: tax on the tram fare; tax on the footy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Record</EMPHASIS> on the way in; tax on the ticket at the gate; tax on the drink; tax on the pie; tax on the bet down at the TAB; and tax on the tram fare going home. There will be seven new taxes for the footy follower, but at the same time John Elliott's corporate box up in the MCG will have a big tax deduction with the changes in company tax claims. There will be a tax deduction for the corporate sector but a full 15 per cent load-on for the ordinary football fan in the outer. There will be a 15 per cent tax on the tram fare of the public transport user going there and back, but there will be a discount for the company car and a discount for the footy box for the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of factors that will come into the GST equation. While that will be one level of debate, I think some very serious thought needs to be given to the fact that we are jointly saying that it is a wonderful idea to drive AOTC with its tariff pricing with an inflation minus X factor while one of the parties in this Parliament, the Opposition, is touting a consumption tax that would drive that whole formula out the window. I think the Opposition has to do some serious thinking about its application of a consumption tax to phone bills and how it would approach the question of Telecom's pricing regime&mdash;before it sells Telecom off&mdash;under the current inflation minus X factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Government, I certainly welcome the fact that the Opposition is supporting the legislation. Obviously, it reflects the fact that we have common ground. It is sensible and there is no real debate about the issues. We have different views about why we are under such time restraints in passing this legislation through. The common ground that exists now is going to give way to major debate and major disputation between the Government and the Opposition over the Opposition's plans to privatise these public sector operations and over its plans to introduce a goods and services tax which will affect every transport charge in the nation. I think that is a fair summary of the way the debate will unfold. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) was drawing a pretty long bow when he talked about the effect of the coalition's taxation policy on the tourist industry as part of his speech on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I must say in response to him that he has again run the line that a 15 per cent tax is to be added to everything; he has certainly got a few of his statements wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He does not say, for example, that the major airlines will be saving themselves something like $9.5m per year in payroll tax. He does not talk about the 27c a litre saving for the general aviation industry through the avgas levy. Most importantly, he does not talk about the real liberalisation of the Australian international airline regime. I was surprised that he did not, because the One Nation statement that we had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February, made great play of this. Here we are sitting back terribly excited about it because the Government in fact pinched half our policies and we congratulate it for that; we are at last seeing some sense in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain fact is that, five months down the track, absolutely nothing has happened. We are dying for the day when some of the brave statements that the Prime Minister made actually come in as policy for this country, because the one thing that will open up Australian tourism is making sure that we get that correct international aviation regime. On all that hangs all the law and the prophets. Once we get that system right and we have, as suggested by the Industries Commission, a 20 per cent reduction in the price of international airfares into Australia, then those opposite will be able to watch tourism boom and watch the jobs it creates. In government, we are going to do that. Mr Deputy Speaker, although this Bill has absolutely nothing to do with the coalition taxation regime, I very much appreciate being able to intervene in that respect. </PARA>

Only one section, clause 15, is to be amended. That is the clause covering the Civil Aviation Authority and the situation of statutory liens; I will debate that a little further on. But the rest of it does not cause us too many problems at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air Navigation Act amendment, which changes the protocols to be scheduled to the Act, is one on which I would like to make a couple of comments. This is really of no great concern inasmuch as, as I understand the situation, the size of the ICAO committees are going to be expanded to allow the admission of the Commonwealth of Independent States following the break-up of the Soviet Union and a change of the regimes in Eastern Europe, and we would welcome that. But there are very few opportunities in this House to pay tribute to some of the work that Australia has done over very many years in terms of international civil aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ICAO amendment gives, I think, a real chance for us to put on the record some of the things that Australia has done, because Australia has been involved since 1944. It was one of the original participants in the first conference in Montreal in that year. Australia, along with New Zealand, was one of the foremost countries to submit a draft convention to that initial conference, which very much looked at the development of international civil aviation around the world. It is interesting that Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain and the United States were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite fascinating to go back through history to see the proposals to govern civil aviation that were put up at that stage. They included one by the Americans for open slather in international civil aviation. I wonder whether the people from the Department of Transport and Communications who go to America to negotiate on behalf of Australia wonder just how genuine the Americans have been from 1944 to this present day in terms of our access to their markets in aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and New Zealand proposed at that very early meeting an even more radical concept, the international ownership and management of all long-range international services. I think a lot of us would probably cringe now if that proposition were put to us. But the really interesting part about ICAO and the work it has done is simply the fact that while there were some requirements for ICAO to meet certain standards in the composition of the Council, including some geographical requirements and some other requirements in terms of technical capability, the major countries really took control. Places such as Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, China and the United States have always been in there, but so has Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been there despite the fact that, while we have a tremendous record&mdash;that is probably why we are there&mdash;we really have a very small international aviation industry compared with some of the other countries. Australia has always held a seat in either the category 1 or category 2 area of the Council. It is interesting that, when unsuccessful in its bid for a seat as an important aeronautical state, it has always been virtually guaranteed a seat as a major contributor of facilities or by virtue of its geographical position. This is despite the fact that countries such as Singapore or Korea have a greater aviation industry than we do. Surprisingly, we are still regarded very much as being an integral and necessary part of the governing body of international civil aviation. I think that speaks a great deal for the people who have gone before us and the role Australia plays in terms of the governance of international aviation. So we welcome that particular amendment with regard to the Air Navigation Act and the ICAO requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporations amendments do not worry us too much. We certainly go along with the Government in terms of the requirement for the Federal Airports Corporation to look after its own environmental impact costs, and we agree with the transitional arrangements for the FAC and the CAA in terms of the changes in their nature and requirements of the taxation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention very briefly, though, clause 15, which is up for amendment today. Clause 15 is amending section 75 of the Act because under section 69 of the Act the Civil Aviation Authority is empowered to recover any unpaid charges owing to it by imposing liens over aircraft. As I understand the situation, the proposed amendments are designed so that the CAA statutory liens are to have priority over all other financial security interests, including pre-existing mortgagees. There are a number of conditions that must be met, we admit, before the CAA can move there. But I must say there is a great deal of concern, particularly within the general aviation industry, on just what the ramifications of that CAA requirement in the Act might bring about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of the propositions that has been put up to us is the fact that private companies, such as leasing companies and hire purchase companies, that might be involved in selling aircraft would have to make an appropriate adjustment in terms of charges, if the Civil Aviation Authority had that provision and there was open slather. It is our intention to vote against clause 15 because basically we believe that the Authority already has that protection of the first bite in section 69 and if it were to have that overriding power some very real concerns would be caused. So I flag to the Minister that in the committee stage we will oppose that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a great deal of concern within the general aviation community as to just what its future might be. I mentioned in a speech in the last week of sitting that last year around Australia we saw something of a decline of 14 per cent in the amount of activity in the general aviation industry. The concern that we have&mdash;I know that people on the Government side also have it&mdash;is about the cost impact of the full cost recovery program. Let me make it perfectly clear: the Opposition is all for cost recovery programs, but we have to make sure that any cost recovery is done on the right base, one that can be afforded by the industry and that is fair to the industry. It does not really matter whether we are talking about flying a Cessna 402 or a Boeing 747; we can argue about whether or not some of the charges that have been proposed in recent times by the Government are fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Qantas would argue very much against the proposed safety levy charge. In fact, Qantas would have to be one of the safest airlines operating in the world. It has a huge department that does nothing but regulate Qantas operations. When one looks at the record of Qantas, one sees it has done a marvellous job. But on top of doing that sort of thing, it was then supposed to come up with another bill for millions and millions of dollars to make a contribution to the Government's police force, we assume, in just looking at whatever Qantas was doing. I think that we sometimes get misconceptions about the aviation industry. Those in the industry are not always a mob of cowboys; they are very responsible people, and when they go flying their own lives are involved in terms of flying operations. I sometimes wonder whether we should sit back and have a good look at exactly what we are imposing through the Civil Aviation Authority in terms of some of the regulations and charges as part of that cost recovery program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In government I would certainly be looking at having a full review of the cost recovery program to make sure that if we go down the path of cost recovery, we have an equitable situation for all concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum which deals with the three amendments. The first amendment will insert two new clauses in the Bill which will make some minor technical amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988. The first is a new clause 13A, which will correct a typographical error in paragraph 20AA(1)(a) of the Civil Aviation Act. New clause 13A will also amend subsection 20AA(4) to clarify that it is an offence for an aircraft to commence a flight unless it has a maintenance release that is valid for the duration of the flight. The second new clause inserted by amendment No. 1 is new clause 13B, which corrects a typographical error in subsection 32AF(4) of the Civil Aviation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 2 inserts four new clauses in part 10 of the Bill, which amends the Telecommunications Act 1991. These new clauses, together with the proposed Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992, will enable a fee to be charged for the grant of the third public mobile licence and an allocation process for the selection of the licensee to be determined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are of a technical nature and do not affects the objects, underlying principles or general thrust of the Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New clauses 43A and 43B will amend the Telecommunications Act to enable the Minister to determine a new allocation system for granting new public mobile licences. A charge will be imposed on the grant of a new public mobile licence by clause 4 of the Telecommunications (Public Mobile Licence Charge) Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New clause 43D will insert a new division 5A in part 5 of the Telecommunications Act which will enable the collection and recovery of the public mobile licence charge. New clause 43C will amend the Act to make a minor consequential amendment to section 70 to ensure that the third public mobile carrier will be able, if it chooses, to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth preventing the exercise of the power under new section 57A to grant further public mobile licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 3 will amend the proposed new paragraph 183(3)(b) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, to be inserted by clause 45 of the Bill to correct a technical defect in the amendment.

In fact, I think he is wrong, because the now Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) was a Minister for communications for a time. I hope the honourable member will take the opportunity to make a public apology for his attack on me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make about the amendments is by way of a qualification. It relates to clause 43C, which makes an amendment to section 70 of the principal Act to enable carriers to enter into agreements which I have described as being anti-competitive. I make the point that, in the event that a third mobile carrier enters into an agreement with the Commonwealth under section 70 of the principal Act, it would be doing so in a manner that would, in our view, restrict competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are difficulties in that the existing carriers&mdash;and particularly the Optus mobile service&mdash;would have the benefit of a section 70 agreement, and it would be unfair, I suspect, to leave the third mobile carrier out there on its own. We would address this broad issue of the problem, as we perceive it, of section 70 at the time we came to government, and it is important that anyone who purchases should do so under the knowledge that we have a different view about this matter.

One of them has been raised by the shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), and that is the decision to give the CAA special rights in terms of other people's debts. The Australian Taxation Office has that right, but the fact that the CAA has been made a corporation is, to my mind, every reason why it must stand with all other corporations in terms of recovery of its debts.

I presume he was suggesting that some of the current reforms are worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable member that in Western Australia the other day the owner of a small ship contracted successfully to cart 700 tonnes of potatoes from Western Australia to Mauritius. I am sure that would help the balance of payments. Nevertheless, when he discovered that the established stevedores wanted $36 a tonne to load his small ship, he put an advertisement in the newspaper to get a competing quote. The competing quote he got was $7.50 a tonne. I say to anybody who thinks that the charge of $36 a tonne is a measure of success that, clearly, it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of the improvements that may have occurred, we still have a gap of about $28 a tonne in terms of loading freight of that nature in Fremantle. That is outrageous, and it must have an effect on the ability of primary producers such as potato growers to do something about it. The WWF picketed to make sure that the private contractor could not get in, and in the end the Western Australian Potato Marketing Authority cancelled his contract&mdash;not worrying, apparently, about our competitive situation. I give notice that I will bring private members legislation before this Parliament in the near future to correct that situation which presently allows the Western Australian Potato Marketing Authority to say who grows potatoes in Western Australia, be they for export or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in the couple of minutes remaining to me that there is considerable debate regarding the role of AOTC and its rationalisation project. I note that many other members are expressing concern about what are basically attempts to achieve efficiency through centralisation to very large or capital cities. I have had considerable correspondence with Mr Blount on this matter because there is plenty of evidence to show that, whilst rationalisation of the work force is something we naturally support, it does not have to be by concentration in capital cities. If Mr Blount, a new arrival in Australia, were to ring Australia Post, he would discover the disaster that was the centralisation of mail sorting in times gone by. If he were to ring the Australian Securities Commission he would find that it has located in the Latrobe Valley with a very high level of success in terms of absenteeism and staff turnover. It is operating very successfully in that semi-rural area. I would like him to think that he can cut back, but not by way of centralisation to the cities. </PARA>

The most significant thing is what was said in 1991. The Government said that it would be moving to general purpose grants or funding for local government and that the funding that would be going to local roads would no longer be tied. A significant part of the 1991 second reading speech on the Bill said that the Government guaranteed to provide a real term funding guarantee for local government general purpose funding `on the understanding that Australia did not experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances'. There would be a real term funding guarantee on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a very serious concern facing local government, which is becoming increasingly apprehensive because the question is, quite simply: has Australia experienced a major deterioration in its economic circumstances? I think all honourable members would be well aware of the difficulties that this country is facing thanks very much to the recession we had to have and its architect, the man who now calls himself the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question again is: will that funding be maintained? I do not think local government got much joy out of the answer the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave in this place yesterday when he was asked whether the Government was, as hinted by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), considering increasing taxes. The Treasurer is reported today as having said that as the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sits down to put together this Budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the coming Budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it will be concerned, once again, to exercise the kind of restraint on expenditures. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Given that, I think it is very important that the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) give an assurance to local government that whatever that restraint on expenditures will be, the Government will nonetheless still honour the undertaking to provide a real term funding guarantee for local government. Otherwise, I think local government will again be the one that suffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that with a major deterioration of Australia's economic circumstances that could be here, the Government has to give a very clear answer. When we talk about government cuts, we all know that this Government has not cut Commonwealth spending anything like it has cut spending in other levels of government. While one might accept that some cuts had to be made, particularly to some State budgets, we still would argue very strongly&mdash;and we have put the case very strongly in the Fightback package&mdash;that there is opportunity to make further cuts to Commonwealth spending. It would almost appear, from the Government's putting in that escape clause back in 1991, that it is still intent on making other levels of government pay for the mess it has made of our national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition does not oppose this Bill. We accept that giving local government more flexibility and more responsibility for the money it spends will probably lead to more accountability and better decision making at the most appropriate level. We are certainly pleased to see that this funding will be identified for a further three years. But I think we have to remind ourselves of the appalling record that the Labor Government has in road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the nine years since this Government came into office, road funding has fallen in real terms by about 20 per cent. Yet at the same time, fuel excise&mdash;that is, the tax that has been taken from the road users, the motorists&mdash;has increased by a staggering 120 per cent. So when we look at the so-called increase in road funding that was announced in the February statement, if we do the analysis carefully, we see that that one-off increase to road funding will restore the level of road funding only to what it was when this Government first came into power. It really is the Government saying, `We have taken it all off you. We are now just going to give a bit back. It is a one-off situation'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to recap a little on the matters raised by the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) in his second reading speech, even though he is at the table and obviously knows what is going on, because it is important to understand that the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill relates to the untying of financial assistance to local government and to an improvement in the way that local government is able to administer its road funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the interim arrangements were agreed to in 1991&mdash;of course, that all arose from the Premiers Conference in 1990&mdash;there have been extensive consultations with local government. I do not believe credit for that was given by the Opposition in the speech by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the Opposition spokesperson, a moment ago. These consultations were marked by a positive attitude and a genuine desire on the part of all the parties to develop arrangements acceptable to everybody concerned. The Minister at the table is renowned for his ability to consult in a meaningful fashion with people around the nation. I congratulate him on that ability and the fact that he gets very good results as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the arrangements contained in the Bill reflect the advice and suggestions obtained through the consultation process and, as a consequence, the Bill ensures that funding will continue to be identified separately rather than absorbed into general purpose assistance, and that is an important factor for local government. It will also ensure that each State's share of the funding level of some $300m will be maintained at its present proportion and that the arrangements will operate for a three-year period. That is important too, because local government needs certainty, as does State government and Federal government, in its funding. It enables local government to make plans on a triennial basis as so many organisations in Australia now have the ability to do because this Government has made triennial funding one of its planks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds will be distributed in each State on the basis of principles reflecting road needs and legislation will no longer provide specific allocations for special roads works; rather the funding of such works may be provided for in the principles which will govern the distribution of funds in each  State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important because it is not always possible for local government to anticipate the needs of either associated local government areas or, in fact, the State itself. Some sort of cooperation is essential if we are to have proper road funding allocation which meets the needs of the broader community as well as the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991-92 funding will be untied and able to be spent entirely at the discretion of the local governing body. The commitment the Government previously gave to maintain the funding in real terms will be honoured. I note that my colleague who spoke previously, the shadow Minister, was trying to intimate that that might not be the case, but I am sure that this Government will make adequate provision for local government road funding, as it has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good people on the other side of the Parliament talking about the Government's road funding as if it will somehow be worse than the Opposition's road funding. In fact, the Opposition does have in Fightback a proposal to reduce the financial assistance to these types of organisations by 5 per cent. That does equate to a very large segment of funds&mdash;approximately $35m in this current financial year&mdash;so people should not be misunderstanding that Fightback has the potential to be troublesome for local government, irrespective of what the previous speaker said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, on this side of the House, a great commitment to local government. We understand that it is an essential tier of the administration structure of Australia. In fact, it was a Labor government that gave recognition to local government many years ago&mdash;about 1972 or 1973&mdash;as a proper entity in the Australian system of government. It was also a Labor government that tried to ensure that the Constitution was changed to recognise local government. Unfortunately, the people did not agree or were not able to understand the arguments sufficiently to agree that local government should be recognised in the Constitution as an entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, the distribution of funds between local governing bodies in each State will be in accordance with the principles reflecting road needs. It is important to realise that, given the size of Australia and the way the population is distributed, local government has had an extremely important role to play in the past and will always continue to have in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The place of local government in our society is secure. In many instances State governments are challenged, but local government is seen to have a very important and continuing role. These days its responsibilities are many and varied; they used to be simply roads and rubbish. In fact, the name `Roads Board' came from the main function it provided. There is now less emphasis on roads and rubbish; there is more emphasis on social and other infrastructure. But roads are still a very important factor of many local governments in this country, particularly in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance and the distinction of local government is that it is a grassroots form of government&mdash;it has touch with the local people. But the fact still remains that some local government bodies have not always applied road funds in the most beneficial way. We all know of some appalling stories of the odd road being sealed out to a mayor's property or what have you. None of us wants to see that sort of thing continuing. The way that the Government is approaching road funding in this particular Bill and in its previous Bill ensures that there is discussion and consultation, albeit that local government still has its own discretion in terms of how the road funds should be applied. I do believe that that is important, though, because planning for a whole region must involve local government. Local government cannot be seen to be a totally separate tier of government from the other levels&mdash;State and Federal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, some local government regions have a much greater need for road funds than others. An assessment of that need may vary over time. For instance, outer metropolitan areas in the northern suburbs of Perth&mdash;where my electorate is&mdash;have a need for road funds to link new housing or commercial estates with local facilities. These are definitely seen as local roads, not arterial roads. We have a lot of problems in the Wanneroo region in particular, which is a very fast growing region; it claims to be the fastest growing region in Australia. It has a lot of difficulty keeping up with the needs of the community in terms of road funding. I know that the changes that have been made here, and the certainty with which the funds will be allocated over the triennium, will be welcomed by the council there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning in this context that current works associated with an upsurge of activity and construction in the Wanneroo region, under the auspices of the Joondalup Development Corporation, will result in a complex which combines intellectual, tourist, commercial, housing and hospital health facilities as well as local government administration. Obviously, none of these things can exist, survive or be linked to each other without adequate road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to hear that the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill, but I exhort the members of the House to support this change. It is a very crucial one for local government, not only for its continuity but also for it to play its part properly in the patchwork quilt which actually is Australian administration of infrastructure. We certainly cannot underplay and understate the role of local government. I congratulate the Minister on having had the consultations about the way this funding will be administered. I am sure that local government will welcome the change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill provides identified road funding for local government over the next three years, from 1992-93 through to 1994-95. It is very pleasing that support for local government these days enjoys broad community acceptance. All sides of politics recognise the vital role of local government in our community and the responsibility that the Federal tier of government has to assist financially to ensure that local government is able to effectively carry out its functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill reinforces that commitment. I am interested&mdash;as the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), said in his response to this particular Bill&mdash;to note that the Government has put a condition on its commitment to future funding to local government; namely, that there is no serious deterioration in our national economic circumstances. It seems to me that that commitment has got the Government into something of a bind. Is the Government saying that the trebling of our Budget deficit&mdash;or quadrupling or whatever the figure may be by the end of the financial year&mdash;is not a gross deterioration in our financial circumstances which may, in fact, throw open the question of whether the Government's commitment to local government is going to be honoured? Or is the Government actually saying that this is not a serious deterioration; that it intended to do it all along and therefore local government has got nothing to worry about? I think local government councils everywhere are concerned that this Government's word on this occasion will be about as reliable as it has been on many other occasions and that the commitments that have been made are indeed on very shaky territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal assistance to local government comes basically in two parts: through the untied general purpose grants, currently amounting to some $719m, which are distributed amongst the various States on a per capita basis; and through the identified grants for local roads, set currently at $307m, which are distributed amongst the States on a local needs basis. These road fundings for local roads will be identified but untied; in other words, there is no specific obligation on local government to actually spend the money on roads when it gets it. However, one would hope that the public discipline of the democratic process would ensure that every local authority guarantees that the moneys that it receives for road funding are, in fact, spent for that purpose. Indeed, a lot more should be spent by councils because they clearly have a joint responsibility to care for local roads and to assist in funding them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that the Commonwealth should assist councils to fund their local roads. A lot of fuel is purchased to drive on local roads, and so a lot of tax is paid by local motorists. The fuel tax receipts of this Government have multiplied many times since it has been in office, but it has largely frozen road funding. Motorists have certainly been given a raw deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a welcome change to see, for the first time, a reasonable boost in road funding incorporated in the One Nation statement. It needs to be remembered that the Government is not giving anything to motorists that they have not already paid for. In actual fact, this boost in road funding will be comfortably funded by bracket creep, by the increases in excise compulsorily levied on motorists by the Government automatically twice a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we welcome the boost in funding&mdash;the first break in the freeze in the history of Labor in government&mdash;it will not go nearly far enough to restore the road system, which has been allowed to deteriorate under this Government. In particular, it will give local authorities the opportunity to recover some of the lost ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the fact that the distribution of funds under the local roads program between the States will be on a needs basis. As I mentioned earlier, the general purpose grants are distributed on a per capita basis&mdash;so much per head. It would be completely inappropriate to use that kind of technique to administer road funding. In each State there are different road lengths, different road building conditions and different needs. For instance, while Western Australia will get 16.3 per cent of the funds for local roads, South Australia will get only 5.8 per cent, even though their populations do not differ much. No-one could argue that South Australia has the same road responsibilities or needs as does a vast State such as Western Australia. Queensland will get 20 per cent of the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued that Queensland is not generously treated by that kind of distribution. Queensland has a very extensive road network. It is the second largest State, but it is very decentralised and has its population spread right through its area. Indeed, there are particular climatic difficulties which make road building in Queensland particularly difficult and expensive. Flooding occurs regularly; Queensland needs many more high level bridges than the other States. Bridges can be very expensive: a couple of million dollars spent on bridgeworks sometimes builds only a few hundred metres of bridge. There is a case for Queensland being allocated a larger proportion of local road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be said that similar arguments apply to the general purpose grants. It seems to be totally inconsistent for local government general purpose grants to be distributed amongst the States on a per capita basis. Local governments in the different States have different needs: their cost structures are different; their disabilities are different; and, most fundamental of all, their functions in each State are different. Local governments in each of the Australian States have different responsibilities. Yet, the funding for local government is distributed amongst the States strictly on a per capita basis. It is a system that very generously advantages New South Wales and Victoria, but seriously disadvantages Queensland and the other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fiscal equalisation principles, in other words needs based funding, applies for all other distributions of Commonwealth funding. Indeed, the States are required to use fiscal equalisation principles in distributing general purpose grants amongst the various local authorities. But when funds are divided amongst the States, for some completely inexplicable and totally unjustifiable reason, it is done on a per capita basis. It must have a fair bit to do with the political power of New South Wales and Victoria, their enormous domination of the Federal Cabinet and their domination of so much of the political processes in this country. There is a very strong case to extend needs based funding in distribution principles for general purpose grants for local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States also are not equal: some are larger, some have small populations, and climate and industry factors are different. In this instance, the Federal Government divides the funds amongst the States on fiscal equalisation principles. I ask again: why is local government treated differently?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has a great deal of power in influencing the economic growth and prospective fortunes of each of the States. It decides where government departments are located, what projects are going to be supported and whether there will be tariff protection, which of course benefits the manufacturing States&mdash;particularly Victoria. There has been an enormous transfer of wealth between the Australian States because of the intervention of government policies. That is a normal aspect of the processes and business of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other factor which ensures that the States of New South Wales and Victoria enjoy an advantage over the more widespread States is the head office mentality. The fact is that most large corporations and companies&mdash;even those that generate most of their wealth in the outer areas&mdash;tend to have their head offices in Sydney and Melbourne. There is a transfer of taxing capacity to the State governments in New South Wales and Victoria and the local governments of New South Wales and Victoria as a result of the location of those head offices in the capital cities of New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong case for taking those kinds of factors into account when determining the way in which we distribute Commonwealth grants to State and local government. I strongly support the view that fiscal equalisation philosophies should be used in the distribution of all Commonwealth grants to local government and, as a result of this Bill, this principle will be used for local roads. That principle should be also extended to the last remaining area of per capita distribution&mdash;general purpose grants. That is essential if we believe in balance and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are often arguments, even within the States, about the way the funds should be distributed. I was quite surprised to see the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Soorley, complaining bitterly in the Sunday press last weekend about the distribution in Queensland. He was backed up by some of his Labor allies&mdash;the Mayor of Ipswich and the Mayor of Townsville&mdash;in complaining that the cities are doing badly compared with the country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deplore the attempts by Alderman Soorley to destroy the Local Government Association and the unity of local government by introducing quite foolish arguments of the nature that he tried to portray over last weekend. It is essential for local governments to work and stick together to ensure that they are well treated in these sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is&mdash;Alderman Soorley ought to know this&mdash;that it was the Federal ALP Government that insisted on the criteria that are used for distributing grants in Queensland. The former Federal Minister for Local Government persistently refused to accept the criteria that existed in the past, which were more generous towards the cities, and insisted that these criteria be adopted. On one occasion Senator Reynolds, when she was Minister for Local Government, actually refused to accept the Grants Commission's recommendations and carved the grants up herself. She used her discretion in deciding which councils got the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the Goss Labor Government has dismissed all the Queensland grants commissioners and has appointed its own people. We have a formula designed and administered by Labor, and now the Labor Lord Mayor of Brisbane is complaining that he is treated unfairly. It hardly seems a reasonable argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the some of the conservative city and shire councils like the Gold Coast, Albert, Toowoomba, Redland and Caloundra&mdash;the places that vote Liberal and National&mdash;one finds that those places get considerably less money than the Lord Mayor of Brisbane or the Mayor of Ipswich. I suggest that they should be very quiet. They should acknowledge the fact that they are being very generously treated under the current arrangements and acknowledge that the processes have been put in place by their political mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only criticism that Lord Mayor Soorley makes that has some validity is that the people of Brisbane get $21 a head from their local government grant, whereas the people of Canberra get $42 a head. I suppose that is par for the course&mdash;Canberra getting twice as much as all other cities&mdash;but it would be interesting to see what justification the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) might have for that kind of distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that road funding is one of the most important elements of the local government budget. Local roads are vital arteries; they carry most of the national wealth. The Government at the Federal level has accepted a responsibility for the national arterials. But most of the mines are not on national arterials; most of the farms are not on the arterial roads; most of the residential suburbs are not on arterial roads; neither are the resort hotels nor the tourist attractions. They are essential, yet they are maintained by local government by local ratepayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore have a clear national obligation to contribute also to the local roads system, particularly now that the Federal Government is opting out of its responsibilities to local aerodromes and the States have closed rural rail services. Country roads have become absolutely critical. This Bill recognises that and I congratulate the Government on making a commitment, for three years, of reliable funding for local roads to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned at some aspects of the untying of these grants but there will be no diminution in the effort on roads. Local, State and Commonwealth governments have this joint responsibility to ensure that the national wealth, the national prosperity, is able to travel to our export ports through the use of an efficient and well-maintained local road system. </PARA>

I find that laughable in an electorate that stretches from the urban fringe neighbouring my electorate up through the rural core of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the effect that the GST and the whole Fightback package would have on local government, and using the work that the MAV has done, one of the municipalities that service some of the area that I represent indicates that just on rate revenue alone there would be rate increases of up to 2 per cent&mdash;based on its scant calculations. It went on to say that it was unable to calculate the effect of any funding cutbacks that one has to assume would occur because of the words that are in the Fightback package. That is what it is all about. It is all about things that are very much unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wannon criticised Peter Cleeland for writing to the local government authorities in the electorate that he expects to represent again in the next Parliament and asking them to make an analysis based on some of the facts that are contained in the Fightback package. That was all that Peter Cleeland said in the letter that he sent to local government authorities. He quoted portions of the Fightback package and asked local government to comment. The honourable member for Wannon could not even mention his name. That is all right; I do not think Cleeland would really be upset by that. But he has to be given credit. He has been around and he is causing a few headaches because people realise now that there should be concern about the way people perceive the effect of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition proposes to move a very strange amendment to this legislation. I suppose it implies that because the two governments involved are conservative governments we will not talk to them. I do not think that the history of the way that this matter has been discussed would indicate that. I think that all the Ministers who have been involved have gone to great pains to involve all interested parties, whether they be State governments or local government associations representing the interests of local government. To suggest that in some way the Northern Territory and Tasmania are going to dip out on being well and truly consulted is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important things that this legislation does is that, like the general untied grants to Aboriginal communities, it gives access to the `identified road funds'. I think it is disgraceful that that has not been the case in the past. It perhaps is a little sad that this has had to be addressed in the way that it has. It is to the credit of all the State and Territory governments that, when they sat down with the Commonwealth, they supported this nation and acknowledged that we need to move in that direction. That is a very important aspect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the legislation that is before us, of course, is that the interim measures that were announced after the Premiers Conference of 1990 are to continue. They do two things. They give flexibility to those local government authorities that wish to use that flexibility, but they reassure local government in general that in some way there will be no skulduggery done in the way that the figures are handled. We will have the general purpose grant. We will have a portion that is identified as the road funds, but at the end of the day the judgment on the use of those funds will be exercised by the local government authority. I think that across the chamber there would be agreement that that is a fair thing. </PARA>

As a past councillor in a municipality, I know that a lot of the decisions, whether they be minor or major, are put under great scrutiny by local communities. Local government is a form of government where one has to be on one's toes. I think that that is a fair thing. At the end of the day it will be the judgment of the communities that are represented by local government authorities that will determine whether these funds are being used appropriately. </PARA>

They are just as important to the day to day lives of the people who live in my electorate as are other roads that have been mentioned here today.

When will the Prime Minister demand from Senator Evans a full report on his involvement in the Symons affair in the same way as he demanded explanations from Senator Richardson and Senator Sibraa?

The Leader of the Opposition said that this was a major issue for a month before Senator Evans was apprised of it. This is not so. It was desirable that Senator Evans's staff person who had contact with this material should have apprised Senator Evans of it so that in the event of Senator Evans being asked about it he could have replied more fully. The notion that the staff member should have been alert to a political issue much earlier than when it developed, as it did, is not to be sustained as an argument. Therefore, the requirement on any staff person who sees material which is not particularly in the public domain or is not particularly a public issue, given the hundreds of issues that any such person deals with, to have a meticulous knowledge of these things and to bring them all to the attention of the Minister, with the administrative complexity within this building, is basically not on.</PARA></TALK.START>

The responses relate to the letter by Senator Sibraa to our mission in the United States and subsequent replies. It does not go principally to the issue. The issue is one where Senator Richardson, not improperly but unguardedly, became involved in discussions with this person, Symons, and has paid a very high ministerial price for it. If people on the other side think that they can extract from Senator Evans some sort of a price on the basis of his being a Senate respondent and his not having an encyclopaedic knowledge of all these events and being able to roll off at Questions without Notice technical replies requiring a lot of information, I think they are mistaken&mdash;politically and in every other way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The BIE's report makes it very clear that the service sector is playing a vital role in providing new jobs in Australia and contributing to the improvement of Australia's balance of payments position. It is a fact that job growth in Australia in the past year has been particularly strong in two of Australia's service industry sectors; namely, the community services sector which saw employment growth of 4.8 per cent between February 1991 and February 1992, and the recreational and personal services area where employment grew by 6.3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the recreational services sector is overwhelmingly conducted in the private sector and is weighted towards small business activity. Because tourism plays a major role in this sector, it makes a significant contribution also to Australia's balance of payments. Of course, foreign tourists coming in are the equivalent of increased export earnings, and when Australians holiday within the country, rather than going overseas, this is the equivalent of reduced import spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national accounts figures show that the real GDP in the recreational services sector grew by 2.9 per cent for the six months from June 1991 to December 1991. That corresponds to an annual rate of 6 per cent and is the fastest of any major industry sector in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BIE report indicates that the economic outlook for the services sector as a whole is good, and the survey of business expectations in the sector conducted by the National Australia Bank in March indicated that 68 per cent of respondents expect demand to increase for their services over the next 12 months. Firms expecting profitability to improve over the year outnumbered firms expecting profitability to fall by a margin of 27 per cent of total responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that these surveys and these results relate to the current circumstances and the current taxation regime. But, of course, there are proposals to introduce a tax which would impact upon the delivery of many of the services which are provided by these rapidly growing parts of the economy. This is notwithstanding the fact that there are alleged compensations or offsets, because many of the providers of these services are small businesses and pay little or no payroll tax. Because the industry deals largely in services and in food and refreshments, it stands to gain little from any of its proposals to abolish the wholesale sales tax. Indeed, the Treasury analysis of the Opposition's particular proposals shows that Australia's tourism would be hit with price rises of between 8.4 per cent and 11.4 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government clearly supports the objective of an efficient, competitive and nationally focused electricity industry as a vital adjunct to Australia's international competitiveness. The national electricity strategy discussion paper, which I released yesterday, builds on the reforms to date and, in the Government's view, provides a blueprint for the future development of this important industry. The strategy is based on the premise that the full benefits of reform can only be realised through the adoption of a partnership approach between and across all levels of government and industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the strategy is the formation of the  National Grid Corporation, as foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his One Nation economic statement. I also repeat the agreement to the principle of separation of generation and transmission elements of the electricity sector, as successfully pursued by the Prime Minister at the heads of government meeting on 11 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that this type of structural reform provides the key to improved competition and offers major efficiency gains. The strategy also provides a range of other initiatives, including the establishment of a broadly based National Electricity Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is committed to working with the States and other key parties to realise these efficiency gains. Already our policy of working cooperatively with the States over recent years has produced significant improvements in the efficiency of the industry with average real electricity prices now at the level they were in the early 1970s. However, further gains are achievable and they are essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's planned and coordinated approach to structural reforms stands in stark contrast to the policies of the Opposition. The Opposition, in this context, talks big on micro reform, but it is lacking in substance. In terms of the Prime Minister's enunciation of some of the major reforms of this Government, I am tempted to ask members of the Opposition to name just one major area of micro-economic reform in their whole period of government. They cannot answer, of course.</PARA>

The purpose of that call was to ascertain whether or not it was possible for Mr Symons to enter into an undertaking to return to the Marshall Islands if, in fact, he did come back to Australia; that is, whether he could give an undertaking that he would not contest an extradition proceeding back to the Marshall Islands. Mr McPhillips, the Attorney-General in the Marshall Islands, indicated that such a procedure is available in the United States. The Marshall Islands being a United States protectorate, US law applies there.</PARA></TALK.START>

Later that day there was a second phone call along the same lines from a Mr Strauss, who was the defence counsel for Mr Symons, inquiring about the same matter&mdash;that is, the issue of whether or not some undertaking could be given whereby any objection to extradition could be waived by Mr Symons. He was advised in the same way: that there is no such provision in Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same conversation with the Department on 10 April, it was mentioned that it was a possibility that Mr Symons had committed offences in Australia in the course of the alleged conduct with which he was charged in the Marshall Islands. Mr Symons was believed to have performed certain acts in the course of that conduct that might be offences in Australia. Mr McPhillips said that in due course, if charges did not proceed in the Marshall Islands, it may be appropriate for that conduct to be investigated in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McPhillips was told that any such investigations would be a matter for the Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, and maybe State authorities, depending on where the offences may have arisen, if there were any such offences.

He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you see potential problems arising for this country in paying its pensions if we do not pursue some sort of compulsory funding type arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Knox said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think given the ageing population, the demographic situation if you like, then my answer is yes.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could argue that we do not need to do anything because we are going to have enormous increases in productivity and we are going to be able to fund the age pension in the year 2020. I do not buy that argument. I think if you do have significant productivity and it all goes to the age pension, then the workers are going to get a bit uptight about it. So I believe we do need to do something on a long term basis, on a compulsory basis&mdash;</PARA>

In other words, here is the person appointed by the Liberal Party to examine its optional tax-driven, tax-related superannuation scheme&mdash;opposing as it does the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;saying that he thinks we should have a compulsory system.

Is it also a fact that this information was conveyed directly to the office of Senator Evans on 6 April? Given that this file note has come to light only this afternoon in the Senate, does the Prime Minister agree that the involvement of Senator Evans, his Department and office indicates that relevant facts have been obscured over the last seven weeks since the telephone conversation took place?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the comments of the Housing Industry Association. They illustrate the dangers involved in seeking to make too much of one figure. Indeed, we heard something of that from the honourable member for Flinders in the context of uncertain recovery, which was the theme of his remarks yesterday. So it is important that from time to time we go back to authoritative sources, such as the Indicative Planning Council, which did meet last month and released a report on Sunday of this week that confirmed that housing recovery was on track. The IPC forecasts a 13 per cent increase in dwelling commencements to 137,000 in 1991-92, and a further 11 per cent increase in 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on short term prospects confirms the IPC's October 1991 forecast of modest growth. There has been speculation that recovery would overheat the housing market. However, the IPC's view is that this is unlikely to occur, as trades, labour, materials and land are in ready supply in the short term. This recovery, then, will return the benefits of steady growth rather than the windfalls that were gained by the fortunate few in the last housing upturn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments of those who would denigrate and those who would pick a particular statistic to create an atmosphere of uncertainty in relation to the housing industry are certainly unfortunate. In that respect, it is worth reflecting on a range of press releases that have come from the honourable member for Forrest: `Government threatens increase in building approvals', `Housing figures highlight volatile market', `Housing recovery not a sure thing' and `Minister wrong on housing'. The Opposition, through its spokesperson, through its shadow Treasurer, would say anything at all to understate, to undercut, to threaten the possibility of recovery. One has to reflect on the fact that affordability is at the highest level it has been for seven years, but for the last nine quarters there has been an improvement in the terms of affordability; that, essentially, the housing industry in this country runs on the basis of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get from the Opposition? There is not a jot of concern for those who need housing around this country, no concern for new home buyers, no concern about the recovery of the housing industry. All those opposite want to do is undercut the possibility of recovery; all they want to do is achieve a negative statistic that essentially will threaten the steady course that the IPC forecasts are about. That is extremely unfortunate because what that suggests is that as far as those opposite are concerned, they have not a jot of interest in terms of policy; the housing industry is of no concern to them. The honourable member for Forrest may be interested himself in property, but in terms of the nation's housing he has no special interest at all. That then translates itself into that kind of knee-jerk reaction. The Government has no intention of allowing itself to be distracted by that kind of talking down&mdash;</PARA>

In the light of this situation, is it your opinion that, in answering this question, the Treasurer met the spirit of the Standing Orders, which are aimed in particular at preventing Ministers from abusing Question Time with matters more properly dealt with, for instance, through a second reading speech available on the same day?</PARA>

This defender of the working men and women of Australia, this paragon of egalitarianism, this man who is supposed to defend the equality before the law and the equality in society of every Australian man, woman and child, apparently regards it as in some way dishonourable to be a `scrubber' or, indeed, anybody else from the western suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>

But, far from being political rhetoric that wounds the Opposition, it reveals him as being a mindless, class-driven politician still locked in battles which most of us regard as having disappeared in this country decades ago.

Just as we do not come to the issue of voluntary membership of associations with unclean hands and a warped, biased attitude, and as we assert that it is just as wrong to compel a man or woman to join the Law Society of New South Wales as it is to compel somebody to join the BWIU, so we will say to this Parliament that if Mr Gyles has found against the employers, they ought to be in the dock along with the trade union leaders.

The High Court of Australia upheld the legitimacy and the authenticity of the Troubleshooters hiring arrangement. Honourable members will remember that Troubleshooters was formed because of the appalling state of the building industry in Melbourne. If there had not been a BWIU thug in every building site in Melbourne, Troubleshooters would never have been formed: there would never have been a need for it.

It found that the men employed by Troubleshooters and hired onto the building sites were paid more than they would have been paid if they had been operating under an award. So much for a sham transaction. So much for sweated working conditions. So much for the oppression of the working men of Australia. No such situation arose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the High Court found was that it was a lawful and legitimate arrangement. It slapped damages on the BWIU in Victoria for contempt of court. When the union secretary wrote to his membership he said, `You are all levied an extra 10 bucks to pay the fine, but don't worry, brothers, I've been told by the Federal Minister that they are going to amend the Industrial Relations Act to overcome the effect of the Troubleshooters case'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this contractors legislation is all about. It has nothing to do with those migrant women as out-workers in the textile industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will be a crying shame for Australia because the home building industry in this country is one of the most efficient in the world. It is cost-efficient; it is productive; and it is relatively free of industrial strife. That arises from one very simple fact: the home building industry is built on independent contractors. It is built on the sweat, labour, initiative and competitiveness of small business men and women. It is not built on the union thuggery of people that Peter Cook used to represent and still does, but from a far more dangerous position. It is built on decent, hardworking Australians who believe in private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is too much for this corporatist mob opposite. Not content with wrecking the commercial building industry of Australia, they want to wreak the same havoc and wreckage on the home building industry of Australia. That is why they bring a Bill before the Parliament. There is no other reason. If honourable members do not believe me they should look at what the Secretary of the union said when he levied his members to pay the $300,000 that the union was fined by the Federal Court of Australia. He put it fairly and squarely by saying, `Don't worry, brothers. I've been promised that they will act to overrule the decision of the courts'. </PARA>

People end up disappearing into concrete pours on occasions in the building industry in Sydney. But what do those blokes opposite want to do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps at the outset in responding to the tirade from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) one should make any listeners aware of the fact that since this Government has been in office there has been a dramatic reduction in the level of industrial disputation in this country, not an increase as one would gather from his diatribe. The fact is that the amount of time lost in industrial disputes under this Government has been 60 per cent less than it was in the period of the Fraser Government. So let us start off on the basis of the facts, which are that this Government is very proud of the fact that its industrial relations record is infinitely better than its predecessor in government which had an appalling industrial relations record when the honourable member for Bennelong was a major member of that Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us start off on the basis of facts about what has happened with industrial relations in this country. The building industry has always been one of the most turbulent parts of the industrial relations scene at any time in our history. The nature of the business seems to lend itself to that kind of relative turbulence. So it is the case that, despite the fact that we can point to a very considerable improvement in industrial relations outcomes not just in terms of time lost in industrial disputes but also in terms of costs of wage increases, et cetera, in the building industry relative to other parts of the economy, the results are not as impressive. But, of course, we have shown concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was this Government that took action to deregister effectively the Builders Labourers Federation. The previous Government mucked around with the deregistration process for ages and got nowhere. It was we who eventually took the effective step of deregistering the Builders Labourers Federation, which was of course a very dramatic step. To be effective it required not just that the union be deregistered but that there be a preparedness of other unions to take over its members. There had been deregistration before; there had been deregistration of the BWIU for about a decade and a half. There had been deregistration of the BLF for several years in the 1970s. But in both cases those unions were able to survive pretty well because of effective agreements by other unions that they would not touch their members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregistration is effective in the case of the BLF because there was acceptance by the unions that they should not regard the BLF territory as inviolate and that they should take over its members. The consequence has been that the BLF in Victoria and New South Wales in particular has basically been wiped out. That is relevant to mention in the context of discussing a proposal for deregistration of the BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have not had time&mdash;and nor, I guess, has anyone in this place&mdash;to assess in any detail the findings of the Gyles Royal Commission. But one thing is for sure: if there is some idea that deregistration of the BWIU would be some cure-all for the problems of the building industry in New South Wales, a lot more thought ought to be given to that before people nail their colours to that mast. If there were no such agreement as there was in the case of the BLF, all that might happen could be that the BWIU could continue outside the system, effectively free of any constraint but still controlling most, but not all, of the territory that it had previously. That is something that the Opposition should perhaps consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that the honourable member for Bennelong effectively has misunderstood the Gyles report. It does not say, as he said at Question Time and sort of said in his address in this MPI, that the real problem is compulsory unionism, the no ticket, no start rule. That is, of course, not a Commission decision. There are no Commission decisions to give compulsory unionism. That is agreed at an enterprise or site level as part of the conditions of employment, in particular in certain parts of the building industry. But that is not something that is provided by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gyles mentioned it as part of the system in the Sydney major projects building industry. But his finding was not that that is the problem; rather, it was that the problem is with the BWIU officials themselves. I do not want to make any comment on that at this stage because we have had no time to assess the report. It came out last night. We saw it only a couple of hours ago. </PARA>

In fact, from what I have read in the time that I have had to read the report, Mr Gyles points out that in the civil engineering industry, where there is a high level of unionism, there is no such problem. So the honourable member should not say that this is a problem brought about solely by compulsory unionism or the no ticket, no start rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we put that to one side, the central point of the honourable member for Bennelong's comments, despite the fact that he does not understand the report, is that he says that we are trying to bring that system of industrial relations that prevails in the major projects sector of the building industry in Sydney and the other capital cities into the cottage industry, the house building industry. That is an allegation that he and others have made since this proposal for the independent contractors legislation, which is now in the Senate, was announced. It is utterly, completely and totally untrue. It is a complete fabrication by the honourable member for Bennelong and others who are making that allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) has gone out of his way to say time and again that this is not the intention of the legislation and that it will not happen. The legislation, which we are not here to debate in detail today, will not allow that to happen. Its intention is simply to address the circumstance where there are sham contractors, where people are seeking to breach award conditions by putting in place supposed contractor arrangements, not because that is the normal way in which business in that area takes place but to try deliberately to undermine and destroy the award wage system. Those are the circumstances that the legislation is trying to address. In doing that, it is not doing anything unique; it is not doing anything that is unknown elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is particularly interesting that all this has come from a report about the New South Wales building industry. This actual provision that the Opposition says that we are trying to use to bring the system that operates in the major building industry into the cottage industry exists in the New South Wales industrial law. It has existed in the New South Wales industrial law for years. In the new industrial law from the Greiner Government, it is still there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absurd situation. The honourable member for Bennelong is saying that we are trying to put something into legislation, bringing this total union system into the cottage industry, which will have this devastating effect, which will destroy the world as we know it, when virtually the same provision has existed in New South Wales legislation for ages&mdash;and it is still there, despite the fact that the New South Wales legislation was massively reformed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this proposal is so heinous, why did Mr Greiner&mdash;the same man who brought about a royal commission into the building industry&mdash;not get rid of it? If those opposite think this piece of legislation is so heinous and will have such terrible effects, how come the man who set up this royal commission still has it in the New South Wales legislation? It is absolutely ridiculous for those opposite to make this allegation. It is a complete and utter falsehood which has been refuted time and time again. The allegation just keeps coming back as though those opposite hear nothing and learn nothing. They keep making allegations which are made absurd by the reality of the situation as it exists in the New South Wales legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, by far the most important issue that this nation faces at the present time is the future of the industrial relations system should the Opposition become the government of this country. The fact that those opposite do not care about the independent contractor legislation&mdash;which, as I say, is meant to ensure that we do not have sham contractors destroying award conditions&mdash;the fact that those opposite do not want that legislation to come in, is entirely consistent with their approach which, effectively, is to destroy the award system. That is the Opposition's policy. Its policy is basically to do that. Of course, those opposite have not set out exactly the final form of their policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of this policy is designed to enable a massive breakdown in award conditions. Obviously it will not happen across the board. There will be areas of the economy where unions will be strong enough and where there will be enough demand for some workers' labour to ensure that that will not be the case. In other areas, where workers are weakly organised or where there is poor demand or poor bargaining power, the Opposition policy would open up massive exploitation. Those opposite know that to be the case. If that is not the case, why are those opposite proposing this? Why are they proposing something that would enable employers to provide for below award conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear those opposite say that we are going to have some legislation to ensure that there will be sick leave or annual leave entitlements of some unspecified nature and some minimum wage which the honourable member for Bennelong told Laurie Oakes could be below the award wage. So there is some sort of protection. How we legislate for that is another interesting point in itself, since it involves a big question of constitutional power. Assuming that we can get around that, the honourable member for Bennelong said that workers will have some sort of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about all the other award conditions which people now have which they would lose in those circumstances? The whole intention of the Opposition's policy is to push people into a position where the security, the safety net, that the Australian work force has always enjoyed is no longer there; where people's conditions would be at the whim of the employer; where they could lose their award entitlements; where they could be forced into some contract which says, `You can have a 44-hour week' or, `You have no overtime rights ever' or, `You have no lunch break' or, `You have no long service leave', or, whatever the employer wants to provide. That is the sort of approach the Opposition would allow to prevail. That approach to the work force indicates a great lack of concern for people who would be unable to protect themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite stand up in this place and say that they are concerned about the work force and that people will be free to bargain with their employers. It is great freedom for a kid who has just left school to work with BHP to be able to bargain with that company or to be able to go to the local milk bar proprietor and bargain with him. Who are they to bargain? How can people who are in weak bargaining positions bargain with an employer? The employer will simply say, `If you want to work here, this is how it is. There used to be award conditions. We do not have them any more. I will tell you the situation, and you will cop it or go somewhere else'. That is the situation that those opposite want to introduce into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, as the potential government of this country, is in an amazing position. It wants to walk away from the position that all conservative governments in this country have supported since Federation, as has been the case with all Labor governments. All of the coalition's conservative predecessors have maintained this system of safety nets, of award conditions. It has been a unique feature of the Australian system. It has meant that we have had protection, that we have not had the exploitation that has occurred in other countries. Yet those opposite, with this system that they would bring in, would open up this massive exploitation of the work force and force people into a position where the kinds of protection they presently have would no longer be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that the independent contractor legislation is bad legislation because it will bring the New South Wales building industrial relations system into the cottage industry is just absurd. Those opposite are against it because it is part and parcel of their whole position of opposing award conditions, wanting to break down the award system, wanting to ensure that in this country there is a system under which the vast majority of the people can be put onto lower wages and conditions. When those opposite tell people about Fightback giving them full compensation, the real joke is that not only does it not give them full compensation but also it means that under the industrial relations part of the package many people will be many dollars a week worse off as a result of what would happen to their wages and conditions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), talked of a reduction of 60 per cent in industrial action in recent times. I remind the Minister that it is a little like inflation. As Max Walsh pointed out, it is always low in a depression. I think it is fair to say that very few people out there are willing to risk industrial action in the current climate, for the simple reason that they are all too concerned about hanging onto their jobs. I do not know whether the Government can take any great credit for that, unless it really wants to boast about having brought on the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is untrue that the sham contractors legislation will not allow increased union coverage of contracting, I ask the Minister for Finance why it is that virtually all major employer organisations in this country are massively opposed to it and are preparing to mount an enormous campaign against the Government's legislation, against its intentions, because they do not trust the Government and they do not believe that anything other than industrial mayhem, restrictive work practices and a general winding back of productivity will result from it? I would suggest that the Minister's claims are blatantly untrue and unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the provisions of the legislation allow unions to recruit contractors, endow the unions with exclusive representation on behalf of contractors, allow the Commission to vary contracts&mdash;in fact, to make awards for contractors&mdash;and allow the Commission to prescribe the use of contractors. Those sorts of objectives go far beyond what the Minister and, for that matter, Senator Cook in the other place, claim are the legislation's limited&mdash;that is their word, certainly not ours&mdash;objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real lie in this is totally underlined by the reality revealed in the Troubleshooters case&mdash;that most contractors end up in a situation where they get better workplace outcomes than those whose outcomes are negotiated by unions. I would suspect that the unions' real fear in all of this is the loss of control which will result as employees come to realise that the best results, the best outcomes, are not as a general rule the product of negotiations by unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the matter before us, which relates very much to the Gyles Royal Commission and its findings in New South Wales, we need to keep in mind what Mr Gyles said of the unions. We really need to concentrate on the power of these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . nothing less than industrial anarchy in which any pretence of the rule of law or the application of principle has been abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. In the interests of balance, I will insert the following because it is only fair that I do so. He said of the employers that `a spineless and expedient approach to industrial relations' was in evidence. He went on to say that the most effective way to end weaknesses, inadequacies and compromise on their behalf is in fact to address the whole question of compulsory unionism, despite the denial of this by the Minister for Finance. It is quite interesting to read what he said. He recommended that the appropriate New South Wales authority move for deregistration of the BWIU in both the Federal and New South Wales jurisdictions. He specifically mentioned the Federal responsibilities in this matter, and for that reason it is appropriate indeed that we consider these issues here before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that he also observed the potential for disruption and, indeed, violence when these activists are confronted by those who have their own money at stake and either are not prepared or are unable to do the type of deal sanctioned by the major contractors. At the heart of all this lies the union commitment to militant direct action rather than compliance with the rule of law and the obligations of a registered organisation. He is basically referring here to the very union which Senator Cook, an ex-bureaucrat of that union, is prepared to bend over backwards for. For example, he has seen to its becoming a senior partner in the Building and Construction Industry Reform Authority, the much touted talkfest approach to solving the problems underlined by Gyles, who plainly regards it as inadequate. The New South Wales Government is surely correct in seeing it as nothing more than an attempt to pre-empt actions that are very damaging&mdash;if one happens to be on the side of the BWIU, as plainly Government members here are&mdash;to the interests of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Gyles went on to say that a comparison of the behaviour of the BWIU State branch with that of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is most instructive. What the latter did pales into insignificance beside the conduct referred to in these reports, yet its coverage was cancelled virtually peremptorily. That is very interesting. This Government's willingness, or lack of willingness, to act in this matter will indeed, as he points out, be most instructive. I would suggest that, as the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, they will in due course be responding to what has been put before them. I would suggest in fact that in terms of this alone there is an enormous responsibility on the Government to bite the bullet and not attempt to evade the issues raised. Commissioner Gyles went on to say&mdash;and this is interesting too:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be those who will contend that the plan of action that I have recommended for law enforcement is confrontationalist, adversarial, union bashing and a denial of various rights.</PARA>
<PARA>We are hearing all that dragged out, of course, by those who feel that their interests are threatened at the moment. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would be nonsense. I do not suggest any special remedies or powers be created or that anything be done which is not a normal part of the law. It is not in any sense unreasonable to expect that all should obey the law.</PARA>
<PARA>We would all, I hope, agree with that. But the fact of the matter is that Gyles holds out no real hope of this happening. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot but regard the policies and personalities of the New South Wales Branch of the BWIU as being a considerable impediment to genuine workplace reform for all of the reasons to which I have referred. The fact that some arrangements may have been reached with favoured companies does not alter my view. With a serious recession in the industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the point that I made a moment ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and much more scrutiny than usual, some tactical retreats have taken place, but I do not believe that there has been any change in strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> put it this morning, now comes the hard part. Now comes the responsibility to do something in the wake of a royal commission which has cost $25m, which has issued a report 5,000 pages long and which makes 62 recommendations. We really have to look at what is necessary now to overcome industrial anarchy of which the Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lack of integrity and respect for the law by a substantial cross-section of the companies, associations and unions involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Again we cannot escape the reality that Mr Gyles reserves his harshest words of criticism for the BWIU. He in essence blames it for the industrial mayhem which is reflected in the loss of time on major Sydney projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question becomes one of how this Government will respond. There are obviously other questions but, in terms of this debate here today, that is the question before us. It is unbelievable that the Government should put the interests of its mates in the BWIU before those of the economy and the people of this country, yet that is precisely what Senator Cook and the Government appear to be about to try to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more reassuring aspects of New South Wales politics in the last decade, as the Premier has steadily dragged the morality of the State and its institutions into a quagmire reminiscent of the nineteenth century with Parkes and Robertson, has been the continued preparedness of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to knife the Premier on all occasions because of their longstanding vindictiveness towards each other. So it is all the more touching that today he comes here in an attempt to contrive a very convoluted defence of the State Premier, who, as we would be well aware, is in the middle of an indictment on his ethics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have an attempt to prop up a red herring royal commission undertaken, as we well realise, by the very man who has taken up a brief for the Premier in defending himself against these charges before he brought down the report. That is the first thing that perhaps puts this Royal Commission in its proper context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when the Premier and the State Minister for industrial relations totally misconstrued the report with comments about a campaign of disruption and distortion, they went well beyond Gyles's allegations about his interpretation of industrial anarchy, et cetera. The attempt of the Premier and the Ministers to in some way impute dishonesty as being a motive for deregistration does not stand up to the light of that very inquiry, which states in its conclusions at page 130:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no acceptable evidence of widespread or serious corruption of full time union officials.One corrupt BWIU organiser was identified. He has not been employed by the union for some years, but he still purports to be able to arrange favours and rewards. There is no cause for complacency in the field, as there is ample evidence of the propensity of contractors and clients to offer money to officials of the union, whether for themselves or for the union.</PARA>
<PARA>In the last day or so the Premier has put a very strong emphasis on this issue of corruption. I think his own credibility with regard to morals, ethics, bribery, forgetfulness or whatever is very much in the public eye at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to minimal comments about the officials of the union, which I have just quoted&mdash;and there has been no serious evidence of corruption&mdash;a few comments have of course been made about employer thugs: people with known criminal backgrounds who have been brought into the industry by employers. On page 130, the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some involvement of persons who can be properly described as reputed professional criminals in the building industry. I do not refer to the many people who have been convicted of criminal offences who happen to have a job in the building industry. I speak of those who because of their criminal background and associations, and particularly because of their notorious reputation, offer services to those in the industry. These services include or purport to include infiltrating the workforce with sham unionists, intimidation of workers, union delegates and subcontractors by violence or the threat of violence;</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bennelong made the usual kind of comment about the MBA. He said, `Oh, we are going to get tough with the MBA. We are going to attack the lawyers. We are against forced unionism even in the private sector and even amongst professionals'. He delivered the usual throwaway lines in an attempt to compensate for this wholesale attack on the union movement and workers' conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This New South Wales Government which now talks about deregistering the BWIU came into power with the same kind of rhetoric about how it would deal with these professionals, whether they be architects or lawyers. The only pathetic performance it put on was a five-minute debate in its caucus and Cabinet concerning conveyancing, when the Minister was repudiated and forced to retreat because he dared to actually talk about doing something about conveyancing. That is the track record of this Government in New South Wales and that is the track record of rhetoric that the honourable member for Bennelong hides behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been stated earlier that the Federal Government's attempt to do something about independent contractors is connected with a long term conspiracy theory engineered by Senator Cook because 20 years ago he was an official of the BWIU or something or other. This is somehow connected with an attempt to impose those conditions on the home building sector. The honourable member for Bennelong has continually attempted to avoid the reality that, despite the draconian industrial legislation that the Greiner Government has introduced in New South Wales in order to try to undermine people's wages, annual leave and sick leave, section 88F is, to all intents and purposes, in existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member might be able to argue that it does not have provisions which deal with whether people can join registered organisations and a few other technicalities, but he well knows that that legislation is the basis for undermining sham contracts. He well knows that it provides the power to set aside those contracts. He well knows that, in actuality, this legislation is largely a continuation of the legislation which the Greiner Government still enforces in New South Wales. We can talk about section 275 and section 278 of the State Act and what the State Government has done about this and that. This is one area where it has not moved, and the honourable member knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A constructive element of the industry&mdash;not on the employers' or the employees' side, but the authority that is responsible for actually superintending the reorganisation of the industry&mdash;has had something to say about this situation in New South Wales. Mr Peter Barda, the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Construction Industry Development Agency, was not too impressed with this attempt to deregister the union&mdash;the same union that in 1986 the mob opposite was hoping would wipe out the BLF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to go through the speeches made in 1986, one would expect to see instances where one or two Opposition members had got up in here and said, `The BLF is not the whole problem in the industry. There are the building workers; they are just as bad really'. One would have expected that kind of ingredient to come into the debate, but not one of them said anything. If one goes through all of the speeches&mdash;even that of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who was the most clear cut of them all in that debate&mdash;one can see that there was a constant hope that the Building Workers Industrial Union would have the strength and the guts to actually take on and defeat the BLF and do the job that they wanted done. Not one Opposition member made any attack on the BWIU or said that it was a major threat in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had the opportunity to get hold of the State <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> in the last hour or so to repeat for the honourable member for Bennelong the ringing words of praise which came from the honourable member for Camden and the honourable member for Ku-ring-gai in support of the BWIU and the unions during a series of debates in that State House. As I have said, an authority involved in this industry which does not really have a vested interest in either side has commented on this matter. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CIDA takes a very different view. The Industry's representative structures are vital components of the reform and development strategy. Far from alienating them from the problems we are striving to involve them in the solutions. They are the signatories to the reform and development agreement together with client organisations and governments, and they have committed their memberships to its attainment.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people are trying to iron out the problems in this industry; they are trying to change work practices and they are working with employers and employees. That kind of organisation sees no valid need for this course of action; it sees it as undermining the reform process. As I have said, there are some points of interest in Commissioner Gyles's recommendations. I was particularly impressed by the racist attack on Anglo-Saxons and people of Irish descent in that report. Somehow it is a crime that four or five of the 50 or 60 officials of the union actually come from the United Kingdom and Ireland. At page 89, the Commissioner saw some great importance in this and commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my inquiry progressed I could not help but notice the number of BWIU full-time officials and activists who were born in Britain or Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the level of intellectualism that he was able to contribute to his analysis of the industry. In conclusion, the Government of New South Wales has continued the practice of undermining unfair contracts. It has attempted to make sure that people's wages and conditions will not be undermined in a period of recession by the continuation and strengthening of unfair practices in the industry. It is absolutely ridiculous for the honourable member for Bennelong to come in here and say that the Federal Government, in attempting to bring in similar legislation, is somehow attempting to act as a stalking horse for the BWIU. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes that today, 27 May 1992, is the 25th anniversary of the historic decision by the Australian people, voting in the referendum of 1967, to give the Commonwealth Government power to make laws about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to include them in the national census;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation and calls on all Australians to participate in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>On this day 25 years ago, Australians voted in a referendum by a 91 per cent margin to support change to the Australian Constitution. Some would say that such a level of support for constitutional reform would be worth commemorating in itself.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 May 1967, the Australian people gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to include them in the national census. As with many constitutional issues, the technical meaning of these amendments does not fully explain their significance. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and many other Australians see the referendum as a turning point in black and white relations. The result of the referendum&mdash;the 91 per cent endorsement of the proposition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were to be regarded as part of the Australian nation&mdash;signified the beginning of a new maturity of outlook and understanding of the position of indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the passage of the referendum is the very foundation of Commonwealth action in Aboriginal affairs. Without that change to the Constitution there would have been no legal or constitutional capacity for the national Parliament to make any laws directed towards Aboriginal people on a national basis, and in current times there would be no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and no action by the Australian Parliament to initiate the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quoting from the Yes case provided to voters 25 years ago illustrates the point. In clear terms, the pamphlet stated that the constitutional change to Commonwealth powers would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">remove words. . . which many people think are discriminatory against Aborigines. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable the National Parliament to make laws. . . relating to Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA>and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commonwealth's object will be to cooperate with the States to ensure that together we act in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is important for this House to reflect on how the overwhelming endorsement of the constitutional change came about, and on the lessons that we can learn as we continue to work towards justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give the House five brief quotes from the debate in this House on the Constitutional Alteration (Aboriginals) Bill 1967, as I believe that they raise important issues for us to consider today. In introducing the Bill, the then Prime Minister, Mr Holt, recognised the effective public campaign which had been waged by Aboriginal people and their supporters in support of that constitutional change. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A great deal of thought has been given, both inside and outside the Parliament, to the constitutional provisions relating to the Aboriginal people and there has been much activity by Government private members and organisations concerned with the welfare of the Aboriginals. In the light of this activity the government . . . has decided that an amendment to the Constitution should be put to the people.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to take this opportunity to pay a personal tribute to the courage, the tenacity and the dignity of all those people who worked tirelessly to organise support for that 1967 referendum and who were in every sense the driving force for the change. Another speaker in the House of Representatives debate was Gough Whitlam, the Leader of the Opposition at the time. He spoke very strongly in support of the Labor Party's support for the Bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of this Parliament will be able for the first time to do something for Aboriginals&mdash;Aboriginals representing the greatest pockets of poverty and disease in this country . . . Hitherto it has been impossible for the Commonwealth to do these things directly itself. Hereafter it will be possible for the Commonwealth to provide the Aboriginals with some of that social capital with which most other Australians are already endowed.</PARA>
<PARA>Three other contributions to the debate are especially worth remembering, being contributions from three of the great parliamentary champions of Aboriginal people. One of those was the then member for Mackellar, Mr W. C. Wentworth. I guess in those days, many of us on this side of the House would have had profound disagreements on a range of policy questions. In that debate, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people say&mdash;I think wrongly&mdash;that no discrimination is necessary in regard to Aboriginal people. I think that some discrimination is necessary. But I think it should be favourable, not unfavourable. . . It is not right to say to these people:  `We will treat you as we would treat any other Australian.' To do this would submerge and destroy their culture.</PARA>
<PARA>I should mention that Bill Wentworth's commitment to the Aboriginal cause continues to this day. He, of course, was one of the people from the conservative side of politics who attended a great day in Australian history&mdash;the handing over of Uluru to Aboriginal people and the return of that place to Aboriginal people. I was delighted to see him there on that occasion. In the debate in 1967, the then member for Wills, Gordon Bryant, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When all is said and done, this is only the first of three steps that will have to be taken. The proposal must first be passed by the Parliament. Then we must get the support of a majority of the people in a majority of the States. Then we as a Parliament and as individual members must take up the challenge on behalf of the Aboriginal people and recover the last 180 years. . . I hope honourable members will realise that it is not sufficient just to hope and pray that this referendum will be passed. We ought, in honour bound, to campaign with the full vigour with which we campaign to return ourselves to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>The final quotation is from what I respectfully consider to be the most powerful and far-sighted contribution to the debate on that occasion, and it came from the then member for Fremantle, Kim Beazley Sr. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the problem that as self-government has advanced in this country, there is no question but that the status of Aboriginals has declined. . . I believe that the Government of the Commonwealth, which is exposed to the conscience of the world and must answer to the world on these issues, should have this prohibition on legislating on Aboriginal affairs . . . deleted from the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say that the Australian people must be deliberately responsible. I believe their very security is involved in their being able to say to the world that this community will ensure sane and just race relations.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words are as true now as they were in 1967. The Bill was read for a third time and, following a division, the unanimous support of the House was recorded. Members of parliament from both sides of the House took up the challenge to join with community organisations and individuals, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to campaign for a yes vote. The question was put to the people, as I have said, on 27 May 1967 and received the overwhelming endorsement that I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential lessons that I believe this House and this Parliament should draw from the debate and the results are these: firstly, that the combined activity of members of parliament and community organisations concerned with Aboriginal people profoundly shaped and influenced the position of the government of the day and that of the Opposition in relation to the referendum; secondly, that the issues of justice for indigenous Australians ought to transcend party politics and party political point scoring and that nothing less than our identity as a nation and place in the world is at stake; and, thirdly, that the Federal Parliament has a consequent moral and political responsibility to act to redress Aboriginal disadvantage, and to seek to meet Aboriginal aspirations. If we can put aside our differences, find common ground and speak with one voice, then that leadership I believe sends a powerful message to the wider Australian community. I also believe that these lessons are of great contemporary importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, the desire to regain cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal affairs was one of my first goals as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Indeed, the desire to regain and re-build the overwhelming community support achieved in 1967 was fundamental to the strategy in developing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991. Honourable members will recall that Act achieved unanimous support of both Houses of the Parliament, and that the Act included a powerful preamble, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that as part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to cooperate and to coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>Unanimous support was achieved, by the passage of that Bill, for an Act which requires initiatives to promote a just reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider community; for an Act which requires extensive public education about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, culture, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage, and the need to address that disadvantage; and for an Act which places firmly on the public policy agenda of this country the question of whether or not that reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians must take up the challenge begun in 1967 and involve themselves directly in promoting a lasting reconciliation to the Australian community&mdash;a reconciliation which, as the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act commits us, as a Parliament, is based on justice and which has a major focus in local communities across this country. Over the last few days many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have asked themselves the question: where are we 25 years down the track, and what progress have we made in ending and addressing Aboriginal disadvantage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to use this occasion to be an apologist for governments around Australia for the things that remain to be done. Nor have I any intention of minimising the extent of outstanding injustice. As we know, the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody brought home to us how far we still have to go despite the great distance that we have already travelled. The Commonwealth has given support to 338 of the 339 recommendations of the Royal Commission which establish a practical and detailed agenda for change. On behalf of the Government, I take this opportunity again to express appreciation for the support given by the Opposition to the Commonwealth response to that Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has announced new funding to implement recommendations of the report and will be announcing further funding within the month to tackle the underlying disadvantages that the Royal Commission found give rise to overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody at such a shocking rate that we are all aware of. Importantly, the Government has established a rigorous and thorough regime of reporting and monitoring mechanisms. The regime is centred around monitoring by ATSIC and an annual state of the nation report to ensure that progress can be measured and that the response of governments to the Royal Commission will not be allowed to gather dust on a shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way we can keep our nation accountable for the implementation of the Royal Commission recommendations and for meeting those Aboriginal aspirations to which the Federal Parliament has unanimously committed itself in the reconciliation process as a national objective leading to the centenary of Federation in 2001. Support has now been forthcoming from the States and Territories for the reconciliation process, and the Commonwealth will continue to work with the States to give effect to the Royal Commission recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Royal Commission also made it clear how important attitudes of mind and heart are in underpinning the achievement of real social justice. As was the case in the referendum result of 1967, the lasting answer to achieving justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people requires a change in the attitudes of all Australians. From that referendum 25 years ago grew the acknowledgment that Aboriginal people themselves could and should set the agenda; that Aboriginal political, economic and cultural values have their own validity and place within the diversity that is Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been increasing recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be able to make decisions for themselves on their own future, as reflected I believe in what is now the cross-party support for the existence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves can take credit for changing the way we look at issues as they assert their aboriginality, their right to be heard, and to implement their own solutions to the issues that they face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there remains much to do and our speeches today should not be read by Aboriginal people, by Torres Strait Islander people, or by any Australians, as self-congratulatory. It is more a matter of acknowledging the first&mdash;but very necessary&mdash;step in formalising equitable relationships in this country. The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody brought home to us just how far we still have to go and how important attitudes of heart and mind are in underpinning the achievement of real social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) addressed the inaugural meeting of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in February. He said that, in his view, the current status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is awful and he suggested that the Council and, by implication, all of us, need to act in a practical and concrete manner to change the status quo. That indeed is the great challenge and the great opportunity facing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as it sets out on its historic task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience since 1967 has shown us that there is more to social justice than carefully designed programs of assistance. That is where the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has an important role. The Council is to be the catalyst in seeking a better knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, their cultures and experiences, so that there can be fundamental changes in attitudes, and therefore in relationships. When we have achieved that attitudinal change we may have discovered what are the missing pieces of the jigsaw that prevent us from completing the picture of Australia that we want to see and be part of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty-five years ago today Australians voted in a Federal referendum to break the nexus between the number of senators and the number of members of the House of Representatives; to allow the Federal Parliament to make laws relating to Aboriginal people; and to remove a section of the Constitution which prevented Aboriginal people being counted in the reckoning of the numbers of people in the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first proposal to break the nexus was defeated and yet, in spite of being coupled with this controversial proposal, the second and third proposals were voted on as one and received the highest support of any single referendum proposal in our country's history. Nearly 91 per cent of Australians voted yes; in my home State of Victoria the figure was nearly 95 per cent yes, and the lowest vote in any State was still over 80 per cent in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time events can gather their own mythology. Reading the newspapers today one can be excused for believing these proposals had something to do with Aboriginal people gaining the vote, equal pay, or full Australian citizenship. It was none of these. So what is it today that we are actually commemorating?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my way of thinking, the 1967 referendum did two things: first, it was a time when white Australia considered the situation of Aboriginal people and extended a hand of friendship. The Australian Parliament, and then the Australian community, stated very clearly that they wanted something done to assist Aboriginal people. Secondly, this was the first time that Aboriginal people created a role for themselves in the political process&mdash;people such as Charlie Perkins and Faith Bandler. Not only did they create a role for themselves; they created a positive outcome. Both these people have gone on to give a lifetime service towards advancing the welfare of Aboriginal people. So what were these two sections of the Constitution? Section 51 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Section 127 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems extraordinary that the founding fathers actually paid no attention to Australia's Aborigines in drafting the Constitution and that the only two references are highly negative in character. When one looks through the debates of Federal conferences and conventions of 1890, 1891, 1897 and 1898, what is surprising is that it was not merely that the founders treated Aboriginal questions as a matter for the States, but rather that the position of the Aborigines was never mentioned. In those debates no delegate ever suggested, even in passing, that there might be some national obligation to Australia's indigenous people. In the debates concerning section 51, the exclusion of Aborigines was never mentioned at all; it was simply taken for granted. In the debates concerning section 127, Aborigines were barely mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When giving evidence on Aboriginal questions for the 1927-29 Royal Commission on the Constitution, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia suggested that the inference of the founding fathers to such questions was due to two main reasons: first, there was no reliable counts of the Aboriginal population available at the time and guesses tended to grossly underestimate the likely numbers; and, secondly, it was thought that Aboriginal people were a dying race whose future was unimportant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair to our founding fathers, I must say that their original intention may not have been what we imagine today. Geoffrey Sawyer, then a professor of law at the Australian National University, wrote in the mid-1960s:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exclusion of the Aborigines may not necessarily have been against their interests in accordance with ideas at the time; while they might have lost the possibility of Commonwealth laws for their protection and advancement, so far as such laws have to depend on Section 26, they were also saved from the sort of laws against their interests which were uppermost in the minds of the delegates as likely to be passed.</PARA>
<PARA>Such laws against certain racial groupings were certainly common around the world at the time. Section 127 of the Constitution is even more curious. In every account that I have read over the last couple of days about the 1967 referendum, this is referred to as the section which allowed Aboriginal people to be counted in the census. However, this almost certainly was not the intent of the original draft of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one relates this section of the Constitution to the entire Constitution, one is faced with the question: under what sections of the Constitution is a reckoning of numbers of people of operational importance? This really applies only to section 24. This section relates to the calculation of the membership of the House of Representatives to be distributed amongst the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the constitutional debates at the time, one gets the view that section 127 was not a blanket prohibition on counting Aborigines, but it was related to the specific operational clauses of the Constitution. It would appear that section 127 related to the difficulties of calculating the entitlement of seats, and thus it only ever had a very restricted scope. Sadly, notwithstanding this, it became to be used generally. From an early date, Commonwealth authorities acting under the Census Act took the view that section 127 was a qualification on the census power and that accordingly, when taking censuses and publishing population figures, the Bureau must not include full blood Aborigines. This was clearly ludicrous. Nonetheless, in censuses published since the first census in 1911, a note to this effect appeared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No State ever felt bound by such a restriction and even though the Constitution did not provide any definition of Aboriginal native the census interpretation restricted it to full blood aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA>The ludicrous nature of the interpretation of the Bureau of Census was carried further when the Bureau presumed to count Torres Strait Islanders in the census but not Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was against this background that referenda proposals centred on removing the negative references to Aboriginal people in Australia's Constitution. This was not the first time that we had such a constitutional debate in this country. On 19 August 1944, under the heading `Post-war Reconstruction and Democratic Rights', the Australian public voted on 14 powers to be transferred to the Commonwealth for a period of five years. These included empowering the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to people of the Aboriginal race. This was a curious grab bag of proposals&mdash;some of which had been rejected as early as 1913; others, the so-called democratic rights, were rejected overwhelmingly by the people in 1988. This proposal was rejected. In 1944 Aboriginal people and Aboriginal people's involvement in that debate barely got off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate in 1967 was different. Aboriginal people were different in that they were vocal and they were participants. They had survived and their culture had survived. The day before the referendum, Faith Bandler wrote the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Aborigines an overwhelming Yes vote can mean a new life of hope&mdash;when you write Yes in the lower square of your ballot paper you are holding out the hand of friendship and wiping out nearly 200 years of injustice and inhumanity.</PARA>
<PARA>She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the Federal Government has the money and so  by  voting  Yes  you give the  responsibility to  the  National  Parliament  and  make  possible a real programme of equal rights and equal opportunity. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The ground swell of support for this proposal was so overwhelming that the Electoral Commission sent out only the yes case. When queried about this, it replied, `We have yet to learn that any opposition to the Aboriginal proposal exists from any quarter'. The rest is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we celebrate that hope and remember a time when the Australian population expressed a very clear wish for improvement in the condition and opportunity for Aboriginal Australians. Twenty-five years is nearly a generation. In fact, fully 60 per cent of Aboriginal people alive today were not born when this referendum was passed. It is worth reflecting today on where we are 25 years later. What has been achieved and what is still to be achieved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year following the referendum an office of Aboriginal Affairs was established and W. C. Wentworth became the first Minister with direct responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs. Commonwealth funding for Aboriginal programs has increased well over tenfold in real terms since 1970-71, when there was the first substantial budget allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entitled to ask: what results have we seen? The answer is mixed. There are some real achievements in education. We have gone from a situation where in 1972 only 72 Aborigines were in higher education in Australia to today, when we have nearly 4,000. We have gone from a situation where in 1967 there were absolutely no Aborigines holding positions in higher occupational status categories to today, when, although there are not many, there are some Aboriginal people at the top, and the number is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, there has been a dramatic success with the reduction of infant mortality. Twenty-five years ago in the Northern Territory nearly 10 per cent of Aboriginal infants died. Today that has been reduced by 70 per cent. While that is still high, it shows a dramatic turnaround. Aboriginal people are running successful enterprises and organisations. Fifteen years ago, the Aboriginal community of Warburton in Western Australia was mentioned in this Parliament on three occasions within a month as being one of the most desperate, violent and depraved places in the country. Today it is a model community which is quite distinguishable from its difficult past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal enterprises in Cardwell in north Queensland, Woorabinda in central Queensland and the Aboriginal communities at Moree and Port Lincoln all have one thing in common: they have happened when Aboriginal people have become tired of waiting and decided to do things for themselves. It has needed help, encouragement and patience from the broader community, but in the end it has been Aboriginal people doing it for themselves. In central Australia, the Tangentyre Council provides a model for Aboriginal organisations. It is currently looking to diversify its enterprise operations and to expand its financial base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the positive side, Aboriginal people are participating more in all aspects of Australian life. The Wiluna Shire Council in Western Australia is now Aboriginal controlled; it is the only shire council in Australia to be so. In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal communities have incorporated under the Northern Territory's Local Government Act and are managing their own affairs at a local level. This is an enormously exciting development and it will require just as much patience and sensitivity as we can muster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to pretend that many challenges still do not face us. Aboriginal health and Aboriginal employment, particularly Aboriginal self-employment, are areas where we have to say that to date we have failed. Even today in Australia, Aboriginal life expectancy of men and women is 17 to 18 years less than that for the general population. For the New Zealand Maori it is six years less. In parts of Australia life expectancy is actually decreasing. In parts of central Australia the life expectancy for an adult male is just over 40 years of age. It can be conclusively shown that this life expectancy has dropped every decade since the Second World War. All this is happening while Aboriginal infant mortality is improving. So clearly we have to be honest with ourselves here and realise that our efforts to date have not been up to the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal unemployment rate has increased from 18 per cent in 1976 to 24 per cent in 1981 and to 35 per cent in 1986. Employment as a percentage of the Aboriginal population is falling, whereas until recent times in the rest of the country it had increased. Only 2 1/2 per cent of Aborigines in Australia are self-employed, compared with 15 per cent for the rest of the population, and virtually nothing exists in this country to help them get the skills to enter business for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This takes me to the last point that I wish to make. It seems to me that there is almost no innovation in Aboriginal Affairs today. We have reached a point where much of the fire, the innovation and the dynamism of early days has gone. We have now created many Aboriginal organisations that, in effect, strangle the emergence of any new or competing organisation. This is a tragedy because it is just in that period of establishment in the early days of growth that an organisation is its most dynamic, productive and innovative. I still find it a tragedy that, in spite of 68 per cent of people in south-east Arnhem Land voting for their own land council in a plebiscite in 1990, those people have been denied it on a legal technicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar thing happened in central Australia, where an organisation representing the Arrente people had its funding denied lest it be a threat to established organisations. I was on the Gove Peninsula last week and met with the clan leaders of the 13 clans in the area. They are concerned that windfall royalty moneys coming from Nabalco are going to be used not to provide long term benefit to the clans in the area, but rather to expand land council operations. These are the same people who brought the bark petition to this Parliament in 1970, which, along with the walk-off from Wave Hill station, signalled the beginnings of the land rights movement. That bark petition is framed in this Parliament. The only survivor of the original signatories, Roy Marrika, is the senior clan leader in the Gove Peninsula today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He and 12 other leaders are once again to approach this Parliament to ask that moneys from mining be more directly used to the benefit of those affected by the mining, and to provide some long term security free of welfare. It will be interesting to see the reception they get, for, rather than fighting white insensitivity as they were 22 years ago, today they are fighting entrenched Aboriginal interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those comments and that background, I am here to celebrate hope. The hope was set alight 25 years ago. It has flickered and it has waned, but it is still alive. It is alive in a move to seek greater common ground in Aboriginal affairs; it is alive in the tireless work of ATSIC commissioners. The Royal Commission showed that there was considerable agreement on the way ahead in Aboriginal affairs, and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is a chance for Australia to examine the place of Aboriginal people in the Australian nation, and the type of nation we wish to be. We finally have a chance to put the neglect and insensitivities of the past behind us. We owe it to our future and our children not to waste this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA>This motion relates to the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre and the Air Force component of the defence logistics redevelopment project. The Navy and Army components of the project are yet to be fully developed and will be the subject of separate approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence logistics redevelopment project, which was announced by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in June 1990, implements a rationalised and centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. Substantial savings will be achieved through the reduction in operating and manpower costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Revenue from the subsequent disposal of redundant property at Randwick, Zetland, Regents Park, Broadmeadows, Tottenham, Banyo and Toowoomba will largely offset the cost of the project. A central part of this strategy is a modern tri-service storage and distribution facility, the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre, which is to be established primarily at Moorebank. Additional warehousing accommodation at Leichhardt, Regents Park, Bathurst and Dubbo will also be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concurrently, each service will improve its regional warehousing infrastructure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accommodation provided will be a combination of new facilities and existing facilities, which will be upgraded where appropriate. This will give the Defence Force a modern and efficient warehousing complex which will enable current technology and systems to be best utilised. The construction of the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre will allow the closure of warehousing operations at Randwick, Zetland and Penrith and will contribute to the part closure at Regents Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air Force component will enable the relocation of the majority of Air Force stocks to bases, and will involve the modernisation of storage and handling systems in warehousing accommodation at seven operational bases. This will allow the disposal of property at Tottenham, Toowoomba and Regents Park. Additionally, other activities such as one operational support unit and air training corps located at sites identified for disposal will be relocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental effects of the planned redevelopment works have been determined to be minimal as works are restricted to the confines of existing bases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is pleased to support this reference to the Public Works Committee because there is an urgent need to reform the logistics area of the defence establishment. The logistics area is a perfect example of the problems of defence which we on this side of the House have been highlighting for some time. According to Department of Defence figures, there are some 14,000 military and civilian people employed in defence stores and armaments depots, and nearly 7,500 of these people are in the Defence Force itself. That is, there are 7,500 uniformed people performing an essentially civilian job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's own figures tell us that currently some 14,500 service people are classified as having `front line combat' positions. So the ratio of front line combat people to people in the stores and depot areas is 1:1. We do not think that is particularly appropriate. Obviously, there is a need to reform this area of Defence, and we have been calling for a refocusing of Defence effort on building up the combat forces. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this reference, the Public Works Committee will consider the development of the National Defence Storage and Distribution Centre. The development of this centre will result in the closure of a number of single service stores depots and the creation of tri-service centres.

<PARA>This Bill gives legislative effect to a registration scheme for migration agents designed to improve standards of professional conduct and quality of service. I announced the proposed establishment of the scheme on 11 December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The registration arrangements are expected to begin operation in mid-September of this year. They are to apply to agents operating in Australia and involve defining a migration agent, establishing a Migration Agents Registration Board and adopting a code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative reflects the Government's concern over the level and nature of complaints made against incompetent or unscrupulous agents, complaints which would be familiar to many members of this chamber. It also recognises the fact that many of those who are likely to seek the assistance of agents are among the most vulnerable in our society, sometimes having a poor grasp of English, fear of authority or meagre financial resources. This is not to say that the great majority of agents are not honest and efficient. It is a sad fact of life that the activities of a minority have tended to tarnish the reputation of migration agents as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to list comprehensively problems which led to the development of the scheme, but some examples include agents having been paid to lodge applications and then failing to do so; lodging applications without paying the prescribed fees, thereby not giving effect to the application; lodging applications tardily in a way which adversely affects the entitlements of applicants; and holding passports as `security and then demanding extra payments'. There are also examples of agents providing incompetent advice because they lack even a rudimentary knowledge of the Migration Act and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems are not new ones and there have been attempts by previous governments to find legislative remedies. Up to December 1989 a registration procedure existed which required persons wishing to practise as migration agents to notify the Secretary to my Department. This practice provided no real basis for regulating the activities of migration agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sought to strengthen migration agent provisions in December 1989 when major amendments were made to the Migration Act, following its consideration of the recommendations of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, CAAIP. These amendments required migration agents not to engage in false advertising, to provide statements of accounts to clients and to not misrepresent their relationship with the Government and the Department. They were underpinned by appropriate penalty provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these were worthwhile initiatives, experience has shown that they have not gone far enough in addressing the problems. Accordingly, the Government had to look at formulating a more comprehensive means of regulating migration agents. This was not an easy task, given the complexity of the problems and competing interests involved. I also understand that Australia is the first country with a major immigration program to introduce regulatory arrangements of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considered a range of options and carried out extensive consultations with the Migration Institute of Australia, ethnic community organisations, community based migration advice agencies and the legal profession. These consultations have been very fruitful and an important step in the development of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of self-regulation was considered but rejected. This was because self-regulation assumes the existence of a well-organised and clearly identified group of individuals and corporations engaged in an activity. The reality is that there is a high level of fragmentation with professions organised into their own distinct associations, with a significant number of persons acting alone. Consideration was also given to a system where agents could practise unless specifically barred or, in more technical language, negative licensing. This approach was rejected for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was concerned that the lack of contact with migration agents involved in negative licensing would have posed significant difficulties. These included ensuring that people recognised when they were operating as migration agents, understood the code of conduct and the need to adhere to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also took the view that migration agents should meet the cost of regulation because they were likely to benefit from the development of a more cohesive and reputable industry, in the medium to long term, and because of the need for budget discipline. Part of the revenue from the registration fees will be provided to community based migration advice agencies. Fee levels are dealt with in the accompanying tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a need to minimise the risk of anti-competitive behaviour that might result from restricting entry into the industry. This has been achieved in a number of ways. Resources will be directed to the investigation of complaints rather than erecting in the legislation entry barriers at too high a level. The composition of the Migration Agents Registration Board has been deliberately mixed so that both industry and consumer interests are represented. Disclosure of interest provisions has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the details of the scheme. A central feature of the scheme is the establishment of a Migration Agents Registration Board, which will have the power to issue warnings, to suspend, to deregister and to refuse applications for registration. It will comprise ministerially appointed representatives from industry, the legal profession, the ethnic community, which has a strong consumer interest in the services provided by migration agents, and the Immigration Review Tribunal. It will be chaired by the Secretary to my Department or a nominee of the Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications and any consequential investigations will be conducted in the strictest confidence. The registration process has been designed to allow fast tracking of applicants by the Secretary to my Department. However, this can occur only in accordance with carefully specified circumstances involving little discretion. If any of a range of concerns are triggered, such as complaints being lodged against an applicant or questions of character being raised, then the board must deal with the case. Nevertheless, I consider that most applications will be able to be approved under the fast track route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A registration process involving basic checks of integrity will be introduced. To be eligible for registration an applicant must be at least 18 years of age; be an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident; be a person of integrity; and meet certain other entrance requirements. The applicant also must not be an undischarged bankrupt and must endorse a prescribed code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public will have the opportunity to lodge complaints within a six-week gazettal period before applicants can be registered. After registration the public will be able to lodge complaints at any time and will have the benefit of the code of conduct to guide their expectations of agent behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred above to a code of conduct. This is a critical element of the scheme. This document is still subject to refinement in the light of ongoing consultations. The code will go beyond a listing of general objectives often associated with such a document. It will delineate a range of unacceptable behaviour to provide a guide to agents and consumers alike. While the code explicitly does not seek to be exhaustive, its scope will be such that it would be difficult for those acting unprofessionally or unethically to claim ignorance as a defence. This should make it easier for the board to perform its functions and deter unacceptable behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code will be prescribed by regulation. It will be capable of adjustment in response to input from migration agents and consumers alike. Decisions on registration have the potential to very significantly affect the livelihood of individuals. Accordingly, the Bill allows for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where agents are dissatisfied with adverse decisions by the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has carefully considered the activities which should be regulated by this legislation. Broad definitions have been adopted to minimise avoidance. In essence, a migration agent is defined to be a person who uses knowledge of, or skill in, migration law and procedure to assist in the making of an application for a visa or entry permit or for refugee status. It extends to advice and assistance relating to adverse decisions on applications, whether in a court or before review bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the qualification of knowledge and experience is an important one because it excludes those providing more mechanical assistance, such as typists and interpreters. Because of the significant role played by solicitors and barristers in providing immigration assistance, those who provide such assistance will need to apply for registration. Clearly, a regulatory scheme which missed these members of the legal profession would be deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There also have been concerns that serious complaints have been made against some members of the legal profession without its self-regulatory mechanisms responding with adequate timeliness or vigour. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make one further point on the extension of this scheme to some activities of the legal profession. The registration arrangements proposed by the Government will be evaluated after two years. While there will be a range of issues that will need to be carefully considered at that time, the Government will closely examine any progress made by the legal profession in strengthening its self-regulatory mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, the Government hopes to maintain a close dialogue with the legal profession, which made some useful contributions to the development of the scheme, although it opposed any coverage of barristers and solicitors. Similarly, the Government will continue its close dialogue with the Migration Institute of Australia, which has already taken steps to develop training courses and a fellowship scheme that promises to lead to higher professional standards and improved self-regulation. The scheme is backed up by tough penalties reflecting the Government's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn briefly to a number of implementation issues. The Government has been concerned not to disrupt the activities of migration agents, many of whom offer a valuable service. This will be facilitated by the fast track provisions that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition provisions also have been framed to allow those who are currently practising as migration agents to lodge an application and to continue practising while their applications are being determined. This is because, like most such schemes when they are introduced, there initially will be a large number of applications needing to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that consumers and agents alike are aware of the scheme, extensive publicity is planned. Steps will be taken to provide agents with advance warning of changes to the code of conduct. In conclusion, this Bill arises because of problems that former legislative measures and self-regulation have not been able to remedy. Accordingly, the Government is taking on that challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the introduction of this regulatory scheme may well act as a catalyst in drawing together migration agents in a way which will encourage self-regulation and provide future governments greater flexibility in addressing the underlying issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House is in a cognate form. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill contain a number of quite significant clauses. I should say at the outset that the Opposition does not propose to oppose the legislation because some of the changes it contains are definitely in the interests of the beneficiaries of the various payments contained therein. Nevertheless, we will be moving a second reading amendment in relation to our grave concern at the failure of the Government's economic policies over recent years and the massive social dislocation which they have caused, and recommending to the Government that it should introduce as soon as possible the Opposition's Fightback plan which will undoubtedly help to rebuild Australia and get Australian families back on their feet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of items I would like to refer to briefly in terms of the two Bills, and I shall combine them for the purpose of the debate. The legislation contains a provision for the introduction of a telephone allowance. This we see as a step forward. There have been some problems with the previous system of giving beneficiaries access to telephone concessions which has resulted, regrettably, in many cases of misuse. The Bill introduces a telephone allowance which will replace the previous vouchers. The rate of the allowance will be $51.80 per household and the amount will be indexed yearly and made available on a regular basis to beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reform of some interest is the change to the bereavement provisions. The Department of Social Security currently grants a range of concessions where there is a bereavement and the Bill will implement a number of provisions in this regard. I should say, however, that the provisions contained are not as generous as those contained in the Fightback package where we have clearly enunciated the fact that where there are cases of financial difficulty we believe people should have access to an additional payment&mdash;that is, the combined married rate pension payment&mdash;for up to six months; whereas the Government is providing that payment only for a very short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further change which has caused some concern to both ACOSS and the Welfare Rights Centre. I refer to the removal of the Job Search and Newstart training supplement under the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. The Opposition is not opposing the Government in this area because we share with the Government some concern to ensure that the JSA payment structure does not introduce a disincentive for young people to undertake long term education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Welfare Rights Centre has put forward what I regard as a cogent case in this matter. It has raised a number of issues which perhaps need to be looked at in greater detail subsequently. For example, it claims that the policy assumes that JSA and Austudy have been equated in every respect and that there is now a nexus that cannot be broken without introducing inconsistencies and loopholes. It claims that this is incorrect, that only the rates of Austudy and JSA have been aligned, and that many other differences exist, especially in relation to income tests, which make such comparisons invalid. This is a matter which no doubt the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, will be prepared to explain to us in some detail at the cessation of this debate. The issues raised may have some substance although, as I have said, the Opposition supports the proposals at this stage because we do not want to introduce any disincentives for young people to undertake long term education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill contains a wide range of other significant changes to the system which we believe are an improvement. For example, the integration of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit results in a program totalling some $2 billion, assisting some 800,000 families or nearly 1 1/2 million children. In addition, the family allowance and the family allowance supplement will be amalgamated into a single payment, with entitlement calculated on a two-step income and assets test basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantage of the changes, apart from the fact that one could legitimately say that they are mainly really name changes rather than substantive changes, is that they take account of the fact that many low income families face the difficulty of receiving most payments more or less in one lot over a month period whereas, if they can break that into two payments of a substantive nature, that will help the families concerned to budget more effectively. We support that view. The additional family payment that will bring together the various income allowance supplements and additional pension benefits such as rent assistance, the guardians allowance and so forth, will certainly enable a second payment to be made during that period with considerable advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major advantage in the proposal is that it ameliorates to some extent some of the existing poverty traps that exist in the system where recipients of income support perceive that they have little financial incentive to increase their income from earnings. This proposal, therefore, does go some way towards overcoming some of those real problems and therefore encouraging people, especially single parents, to go into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is claimed by the Government that some 35 million families will receive additional family allowance as a result of the new data matching for families contained in these proposals. There is some concern, which has been voiced by some of my colleagues, about the extent to which the data matching of profiles will extend beyond the existing provisions. I understand that the Government proposes to make subsequent amendments to the appropriate legislation in this field. But overall, as I have said, while we will move a second reading amendment, we do support the proposals in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that 1.4 million Australians now receive welfare benefits in the form of unemployment, single parent or disability pensions. We are seeing today, despite the commitment made by the previous Prime Minister that by 1990 no child would live in poverty, the simple situation that, according to ACOSS, over 600,000 children are directly affected by poverty caused principally by unemployment or serious underemployment. The number of children living in families below the Henderson poverty line rose from 400,000 in 1989-90 to 600,000 in recent times, and the prospects are that the number could well be increasing. For example, the Salvation Army alone is facing some 6,000 client families and is unable to meet the unprecedented demand. The inner city crisis centres experienced a 100 per cent increase in numbers over the last 12 months alone. The Smith Family recently announced a 35 per cent rise in numbers seeking assistance over the past year, and 70 per cent of the increase consisted of families who had never before sought assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback proposals contain a very important additional support for welfare agencies in the private sector and for their clients. We will provide an additional $50m to welfare agencies so that organisations such as the Sydney City Mission, for example, will be able to directly provide additional places in their excellent training programs to help the many thousands of Australians who today face such serious economic and social hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that one in five children now live in families which do not have an adult in full time employment. As I have said, the real fear is that that figure will tend to grow further. We now face the situation, according to the official figures, of nearly one million people unemployed, and it is estimated that a further 500,000 are facing underemployment. That represents 10.4 per cent of the full time work force in April. At the last election in March 1990, which was not very long ago, the number of people unemployed was 512,000. In April 1992 it was 886,700. That represents an extra 374,000 unemployed in 25 months&mdash;an extra 3,416 unemployed a week, an extra 488 unemployed a day, an extra 20 unemployed an hour and an extra one unemployed every three minutes. So, while the audience in this House has been listening to this debate, we have already added at least another 14 people to the unemployed list on the basis of these aggregate figures. Regrettably, youth unemployment represents three times the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder, therefore, that in virtually every area of social policy facing this country, whether in terms of education, social problems caused by bankruptcy or family breakdown, the statistics are simply horrendous. We know that some 49,700 qualified young people missed out on university entrance places this year. That represents a shortfall of up to 70 per cent on last year. I ask anybody in this House representing the Government to give us a commitment here and now that we will not see an increase in that percentage at the end of this academic year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the problem of bankruptcy. In the December quarter 4,764 individual and business bankruptcies were recorded, which was an increase of 39 per cent from the December quarter of 1990. There were 13,700 in 1991, an increase of 50.3 per cent from 1989-90. In fact, the 1990-91 statistic represents the highest number of bankruptcies on record in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the field of family breakdown, a large component of which is clearly the result of economic dislocation and failure of families to find work, 44,913 children were dependent on parents who were divorcing in 1990. In the same year 42,635 families broke down according to law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation the Government has given families on incomes up to $60,000 a cash handout through the family allowance system. Why has it done that? Was it because it was sorry for the recession? Is that the best it can say? Surely that is not the way to get people back on their feet. What families are looking for today is some sense of hope and a belief that there is a plan in existence to lead this country forward and to give some prospect of a better future for themselves and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of Australian families, and especially their children, have become undermined and disillusioned not just by the recession, which is an absolute national disgrace, but by the fact that we have in Australia a government which is now in its tenth year in power. Despite all the hopes and expectations of the past, despite all the promises made by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), especially on the nights when he stood at the dispatch box in this chamber and told us of the glories of what he had achieved and what he would achieve in the future, it has all turned to dust in our hands and we now see an economy that is no longer capable of employing its people, no longer capable of giving a decent education to its children and, above all, no longer capable of giving them a sense of future, a sense of pride, a sense of belonging and a sense of worth. They are the most damaging legacies which will be left to the Australian people by this Hawke-Keating Government and which we when our turn comes will have a difficult road to build up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Fightback package is based on the premise that we are prepared to make a commitment that we will put back into employment at least two million Australians by the year 2000. That is still not enough; we accept that. But to get it higher than that will depend on the success and implementation of our blueprint, our economic and social plans for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government has fiddled around the edges with these amendments&mdash;that is really what it has done&mdash;the reality is that the stable door in so many respects has already been closed and, unfortunately, the horse of unemployment&mdash;and all the social dislocation and decay that it carries with it&mdash;has already bolted. So, while most of the amendments are worth while, regrettably they do not address the main problem, which is the social destruction caused to so many Australian families and their children by the recession. Regrettably, the Government is offering an unfunded conglomeration of half measures in the name of a One Nation package. We do not want fiddling at the edges. We want real answers and a real direction, and that is what is given by Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic plan, Fightback, will effectively create jobs. It is an active policy, not a reactive one. It will help people to help themselves. Australia needs an active plan, which clearly is not forthcoming from the Government despite the recession&mdash;nearly a depression in parts of Australia&mdash;created by its economic policies. In the welfare system, the unemployment policy of the present Government, in particular, is not working as efficiently as it should. Fightback will relieve most of the taxes on business, will reform the labour market and will create opportunities for employment to, above all, give employers a sense of confidence that they can employ more people, can develop markets, can create productivity and can cut their costs. That is why we have been prepared to make the commitment to create two million new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we heard from the Government? Not a word. There are no commitments in the so-called One Nation statement because the Government knows that it cannot build a successful economy on the ruins of the failure of the recent years simply by increasing national debt. Our role is to pay off our national debt and get Australia back to self-sustained economic growth as soon as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the Fightback package offers families significant personal income tax cuts, increases in family allowance benefits and increases in the dependent spouse rebate. It offers tax credits for private health insurance; superannuation reforms; significant reductions in the costs of fuel in terms of production as well as for the ordinary person using a car; a first home owners scheme; a tax free savings scheme; a tax rebate for child-care; and a zero rating in terms of GST on health and education, and some other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To us, jobs are a fundamental priority. This is the key to the Australian people regaining self-respect. It is the only way of ensuring that families have any sense of security for the future. We believe Fightback will create jobs by cutting $20 billion from taxes on business and reforming the labour market. The only real way that employment in Australia can be increased is to let the private sector feel that it has a future, that investment in Australia is worth while and that in the long term we can be a society that is better off and can look to the future with some confidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did hear from the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), about the dependent spouse rebate. That was yet again a further indication of how out of touch many of the people on the other side of the House are. It may be of interest were he to note that those families in Australia who have a male breadwinner, a female spouse at home and children, represent 19 per cent of all Australian households. The Arnott's biscuit advertisement with the picket fence and the male breadwinner does not even represent 20 per cent of Australian households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we should also ask why this great burgeoning of the dependent spouse rebate, which will help a mere 19 per cent of Australian households, is touted as some great and momentous occasion. When we look at the changes to the integrated family payment system which will occur from 1 January 1993, we will see that we are targeting all sorts of families which make up Australian households. We have recognised that these families exist. Such payments are an acknowledgment of the demands and the needs which children in our families have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the rationalising of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement means that payments will be made weekly to families to enable them to make the kinds of commitments and the kinds of payments which they would like to make. The legislation also covers the rent assistance package and assistance for guardians. It will ensure that people understand the sorts of payments that are being made to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date very many people in our community do not understand that they are in receipt of two payments for children, or that these payments are available to working families. This legislation creates a single visible family payment. It is that recognition of a commitment to families which for so long has been the hallmark of this Government. Our contribution is not just to families, but also to veterans and other recipients who are overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 81 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill amends section 1208 of the Social Security Act to provide that an agreement on social security between Australia and the Republic of Austria is a scheduled international social security agreement for the purposes of the Act. Because the agreement on social security between Australia and Austria had not been signed at the time the amending Bill was being drafted, it was not possible to insert the text of the agreement as a schedule to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement on social security between Australia and Austria has since been signed and is expected to come into force on 1 October 1992. That agreement can now be incorporated into the Act by way of a schedule, which was the method by which such agreements were included in the Social Security Act 1991. Consequently, the Government proposes to move an amendment in the Senate to omit clause 81 of the amending Bill and insert the text of the agreement on social security between Australia and the Republic of Austria as a schedule to the Act. This will also accommodate the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It can be seen that our commitment to social security extends across the whole international sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of these Bills addresses the veterans community. One of the changes which directly affects both the veterans community and the age pensioner community relates to telephone allowances. It might be worth reminding honourable members of our commitment to veterans. There are three rates for telephone allowance: the World War I rate, which is equal to the annual telephone rental charge&mdash;we believe our World War I veterans and mariners are entitled to that; the $51.80 per year rate for all eligible disability pensioners, war widows and single service pensioners; and the $29.50 per year rate for all eligible service pensioners who have a partner who is also eligible. We acknowledge the needs of our veterans community, but we also recognise that those needs vary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting and important aspect of this change in the Veterans' Affairs Bill enables a pensioner who pays for access to a PABX telephone line in a nursing home to now be eligible for a telephone allowance. As honourable members would appreciate we have many veterans who are quite aged and in need of some special treatment and who live in nursing homes. Those people will now be able to participate in, and take advantage of, the telephone allowances scheme. That is surely a very important aspect of our commitment to our veterans' community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other group of veterans who were addressed under this legislation are those who are part of the peacekeeping force in Cambodia. All of us would recognise that the role of Australia's Defence Force in keeping the peace would seem to be a much more important role than in securing war. We take great pride in the commitment of those veterans. We recognise that service and so grant them their entitlements under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately these Bills acknowledge the role that is central to the Social Security Act, that of putting families, children and the care of children in a central focus. Indeed, I despair of the Opposition spokesperson, who said that Fightback was about helping people to help themselves. We know that and we know what it was like to try to help ourselves for all the years we worked and lived under a Liberal Party regime. We know that the reason that the Opposition intends to make payments to the Salvation Army and various other groups is that people are very often not able to help themselves and so have to rely and depend on those wonderful community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Social Security Act does, and what this Government does, is make a commitment to provide income support to people within our community who are in special need or deserving of the taxpayer dollar. It is in that context that we make our commitment to Australian families, youth, veterans and aged pensioners. It is with those people in mind that we make these amendments. We do not and will not charge them an extra 15 per cent for every sliver of food that goes into their mouths or piece of clothing that goes on their backs. That would grind them down. How it would help them to help themselves I have not worked out, but I am sure that various honourable members on the other side of the House will explain that 15 somehow equals four, in the words of Andrew Denton, or that a 15 per cent GST is definitely helping people to help themselves. On this side of the House, we are not so silly. We make a commitment to humanity, egalitarianism and a society in which everybody has a place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate. Initially, I would like to make a few comments on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. As has already been indicated, the Opposition supports this legislation, as most of it is of minor significance. The amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to extend benefits to Australian Defence Force personnel serving in Cambodia recognises Cambodia as an operational area for the purposes of veterans' benefits. Clearly, Australians serving in Cambodia are at risk and we most certainly agree that they are entitled to commensurate benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has consistently expressed concern for the safety of our troops in Cambodia. Unfortunately, until recently Parliament was not kept well informed about the full role of our troops there. Parliament must be kept informed&mdash;it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that it is kept informed&mdash;about the role of all our troops overseas if bipartisan support for our involvement in these vital peacekeeping operations is to be maintained.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a matter of some pride that an Australian, General Sanderson, is the military commander of the United Nations forces in Cambodia. I know that Australian soldiers there will acquit themselves well, as they have always done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill is ostensibly about helping families. To the extent that it does, we support it. We welcome, in particular, the Government's new approach to intra-family income distribution, particularly in respect of low income families. We support the Government's approach to concentrating benefits towards the primary care giver in low income families&mdash;and that, of course, is usually the mother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of families in Australia today as a result of this dreadful recession that we are experiencing is indeed serious. Many families are in dire straits. The legislation that we are dealing with here tonight does nothing substantial about this situation. This Government's policies, despite what we hear from it day after day, have actually destroyed many families. This Government's policies have created a situation where unfortunately it is almost necessary for both parents to work. For many families it is a matter of survival for both parents to have to go out to work. The social costs, particularly where young children are involved, will be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's only solution to this, of course, is to rapidly expand the availability of child-care. Desirable as that may be, it is, in my view, second-best. The best child-care, particularly for young children, is parent care. But this Government's policies have put that beyond the reach of many families and the children of these parents are suffering and they will suffer in the future as a result of this second-best option for taking care of children in their tender years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also created a situation where family allowances&mdash;however termed; whatever the semantics&mdash;are regarded these days generally as welfare and recipients of that assistance are treated as if they were recipients of welfare. This completely overlooks the original intention of family support and the real reason for it, which was, of course, to take cognisance of the special place of the family with children in our society. Yet this Government's policies have threatened those sorts of families. They have not encouraged people to have children and have made it difficult for people with children to survive as a family. I think that a legacy of this Government in that respect will be one that we will have to live with well into the next century as children grow up not having been properly cared for in their early years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, if we go into the figures, to note how significantly the value of family allowance has in fact declined under this Government over the past eight or nine years. Despite what we have heard from the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) here this afternoon, the Opposition has a real and measurable commitment to family. Of course, that is outlined in detail in the Fightback package. If the honourable member for Forde cannot understand or chooses not to try to understand the effect of the GST&mdash;she talked in glib terms about how 4 per cent could be 15 per cent&mdash;I am happy to spend time with her explaining in detail the effect&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining to me I just talk about the Opposition's commitment to family, that real commitment that is outlined in the Fightback package. I am proud to stand here as a member of a coalition government which is able to demonstrate to the people of Australia that we care about families. We care about traditional families. We want children to grow up being properly taken care of, ideally by one of their parents in their early years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have demonstrated that commitment in Fightback by proposing to double the family allowance where family income is less than $30,000 a year. That, of course, is a significant increase in family allowance and will more than take account of the effect of inflation over the last 10 years. For families earning between $30,000 and $40,000 a year, we will increase family allowance by 50 per cent. The dependent spouse rebate will increase from $1,379 to $1,679 a year for eligible families with children. Eligible families with incomes of less than $30,000 will receive tax credits of up to $400 to assist them with the cost of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given more time, I would like to have gone on to deal in great detail with the other parts of the Fightback package which benefit families. I challenge members of the Government to refute in any cogent or meaningful way the fact that the Fightback package is demonstrably, clearly and overwhelmingly pro-family. I do not have any hesitation in saying that. I am particularly pleased to be a member of a Party which is pro-family and will attempt to repair the damage that this Government has done to families over the past nine years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a long time since I have heard such a patronising contribution to debate in this House. But I thank the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for it nonetheless, because it shows quite starkly the difference between the Opposition and the Government on matters relating to families, women, working, child-care and taxes on food and clothing.

I am absolutely amazed that somebody in this House would go back to the stage of expecting women to be barefoot and pregnant and be asking women to stay at home to look after children just because he thinks that is the right thing for them to do. It is absolute foolhardiness to be telling women in the 1990s to stay at home and look after their children. If they wish to do that, they will do that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care, the family allowance supplement, and social security payments to families are important matters in the Australian community. I defy the honourable member for McPherson to go out into his electorate and tell all of those people who are receiving the family allowance supplement&mdash;which will now be a combined family payment, thanks to the endeavours of the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett)&mdash;that they are not entitled to that payment any longer; nor are they entitled to child-care any longer; or, if they are entitled to child-care, that they will now be paying a 15 per cent sales tax or GST on it, thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is important that we understand that people in Australia who are receiving a family allowance supplement get that payment only if one or other of the members of the family is already in the work force. This is not welfare: it is a supplementation of the family's wage earning ability precisely so that one member of the family can remain at home to look after the children if that is the family's choice. </PARA>

I have said before that when I was not a member of this House I implored one of the Liberal Ministers of the time to create a payment like the family allowance supplement. That, of course, did not occur. Our Government was the only government which had the nous to realise that if people were going to be better off on welfare than they would be in the work force, it was required of the Government to provide some supplementary benefit or payment which would attract them into the work force to earn a relatively low wage.

I condemn the perpetrators of the horrific violence which took place in Bangkok at that time. At the same time, just over the border, and partly resupplied through Thailand, are a number of guerrilla forces in Cambodia. The Australian peacekeeping force is in an operational circumstance. This legislation recognises that operational circumstance in Cambodia. I believe that as such it is welcome in the benefits which are allotted and other anomalies which are rectified by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is as follows: I am not aware of the facts relating to the allegations the honourable member for Kooyong made about the date of payment of $25,000 by Gregory Symons to his trustee. Further, I am totally unaware of Mr Symons's private financial affairs and I cannot speculate on what reasons there may or may not have been for his alleged financial transactions. However, I can inform the honourable member for Kooyong that the EMDG grant he refers to was paid to Mr Symons on 2 December 1991. This is some six weeks after the date when the honourable member alleges Mr Symons paid his trustee the amount referred to. Therefore, the EMDG grant was not directly used to discharge his bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, these allegations and questions regarding Mr Symons's private affairs are irrelevant to the substantive part of the honourable member's question which related to the payment of EMGD entitlements to individuals who are involved in proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act. EMDG payments are an entitlement following eligible expenditure under the Act, just as a tax rebate or child endowment is an entitlement. EMDG grants are made available in the financial year after the eligible expenditure is carried out. The financial situation of any EMDG claimant may wax or wane after the eligible expenditure has been made. Anyone who has been in business knows this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of any change in economic circumstances, an EMDG entitlement is still valid and must be paid under the Act. In the case of bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership, any EMDG entitlement constitutes an asset of the eligible EMDG claimant and may be directed to any purpose the claimant sees fit. As I pointed out to the honourable member for Kooyong in my letter of 26 May, yesterday, the EMDG Act was reviewed in 1989, and in 1990 the EMDG Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 was supported in both Houses by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point again, as was made earlier today with the wool legislation, that this is very important legislation for one of the major agricultural industries of Australia and we have a guillotine in place that will provide less than an hour for debate. This is important legislation because it will carry the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry in particular through to the turn of the century and beyond&mdash;that is 70 per cent of the industry in Australia with over $700m of exports. It is the most significant regional industry in Australia, employing about 100,000 people directly and indirectly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate happens to be the most significant dairy production area of Australia particularly for the manufacturing sector and for exports. The Shepparton Kyabram Rodney Development Corporation prepared a report in relation to the Industry Commission recommendations indicating the significance of the industry to this part of Australia. It said that if the Industry Commission recommendations had been accepted in toto&mdash;which presumably means the State and city milk sector as well&mdash;it would have had an impact of $160m a year on the industry in that area. So that indicates the significance of the industry and the importance of this legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will refer to that in a couple of minutes. The dairy industry has also been very adept in changing its market strategy for exports from the old, traditional markets of Europe to Asia and the Middle East, and particularly Asia, where the majority of our dairy products are now exported. It is also the most significant agricultural industry with regard to value adding or further processing. I do declare an interest as I have a dairy farm and supply a cooperative factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation replaces what has become known as the Kerin plan. It has been a basically successful five-year program which has given stability to an industry through the all milk levy and other components. At the same time there has been very rapid rationalisation and increase in productivity in that industry. People tend to forget that the Kerin plan bears very little relationship to Minister Kerin. The original proposal he brought to the Parliament was held up for 12 months and considerably amended by a combination of my predecessor, Ralph Hunt, the then honourable member for Gwydir, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the Dairy Industry Council. I remind people that the five-year program owes its success very much to the Opposition as well as to the Government. The dairy industry has made it very clear that it does not want any delays to the legislation, and the coalition agrees with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members look at my electorate where there has been continuing significant investment, and I have eight major dairy factories in the electorate, they will see that it only needs the right signals in the market&mdash;domestically and internationally, with some stability and commercial relationships with exports&mdash;to realise that there is far more investment ready to take place in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the normal practice, whether it is a Labor or a coalition government in office, there was an Industry Commission inquiry into the industry. One of the major aspects of the Industry Commission's recommendations related to city milk. Of course, that is regulated by the States. The States said that they were not going along with that particular part of it. So that has been put to one side, as I think everybody anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the manufacturing sector, the Government has basically followed the recommendations or direction of the Industry Commission, with two exceptions. The Industry Commission recommended a phase-down starting with 20 per cent support through the all milk levy for the coming season and going down to 5 per cent by July 1986. The Government, through the legislation, has recommended a 12-month delay or holding at the present 22 per cent level, down to 10 per cent by the year 2000. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has said, this is the equivalent of about a 5 per cent support arrangement because of the mix between the domestic market and export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that underwriting and the all milk levy, to a certain extent, serve the same purpose. That is, they can have a similar impact in the sense of providing stability in the export market. I suppose it could be said&mdash;that may be the reason the Government made that the decision; it is for the Minister to say&mdash;that to a certain extent they cancelled each other out and that the slower phase-down was the reason the Government did not proceed with underwriting. But it is for the Minister to say why that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's decision is basically in line with general coalition policy, that is, that all industries should be down by the year 2000 to a negligible or 5 per cent level of tariff or its equivalent. I remind people that the Government, in this case, has actually treated the dairy industry harder than it has some other industries, for example, the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the motor vehicle industry. By the year 2000 they will be down to tariff levels of 25 per cent and 15 per cent in each case. The fact that the Government is not treating those industries in the same way as it is treating the dairy industry and many other industries adds to dairy farmers' costs. The dairy farmers of Australia are well aware of that. They know very well&mdash;I am not sure that many other people in Australia know very well&mdash;that there are absolutely no tariffs on imported dairy products, and there have not been for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if there were tariffs on dairy products imported into Australia from other countries, the fact is that under closer economic relations with New Zealand there are no tariff restrictions on product from New Zealand; there are no dumping or countervailing procedures on product from New Zealand. New Zealand has, in overall terms, the most efficient manufacturing dairy industry in the world. I say that coming from the Goulburn Valley, which many would claim is the equivalent. But I believe that New Zealand has some advantages, particularly now that the New Zealand Government has undertaken some very significant industrial relations reform so that there is greater efficiency in its factories;  greater efficiency in its transport; and particularly greater efficiency on its waterfront. It is said that the average New Zealand dairy farmer is $3,500 a year better off than he was before these reforms, purely because of the genuine reforms that have taken place on the waterfront. The Australian dairy farmer has not had that equivalent advantage.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand dairy farmers also have the advantage of a goods and services tax, which reduces their cost of production and assists them with exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that the presence of New Zealand limits the ability of the industry, irrespective of any other arrangements, to increase the price of dairy products sold on the domestic market in Australia, that is, butter, cheese and so forth. There are absolutely no impediments to those products coming in from New Zealand. I know that some people would add other arguments that there are benefits for New Zealand because of its pooling arrangements and the special access it has to the European Community, still at quite a high price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, I commend the dairy industry leadership in this country. I commend Pat Rowley, John Watson, Michael Taylor, John McQueen and others for the very positive and sensible way that they have negotiated this with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I commend the Minister because I believe that it is a successful negotiation and he has been prepared to listen and to learn. I make that point with regard to my area because I know that he came into it at the invitation of the industry. I think he visited the factory that I supply and it was one of a number. I make the point that I believe we have a good example of an industry leadership that has worked its way through government in a sensible and pragmatic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major feature of this legislation is the all milk levy. It provides the stability with regard to export assistance or incentives, which maintains the stability on both the domestic market and the export market. That is paid for by every dairy farmer in Australia. It is not paid for by government under any budgetary arrangement. The maximum is 45c a kilogram fat and the maximum level of theoretical assistance was 30 per cent, but it is at 22 per cent at the present time and I have indicated that it is coming down over those next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry has suffered more than any other agricultural industry in Australia from unfair trade practices internationally. The European Community got to a surplus position with the dairy industry over 10 years ago. It was well ahead of the grain industry, the sugar industry, the beef industry or any horticultural industry. In fact, there have been countervailing actions against those European export subsidies for quite a few years. At the same time as we have given this unlimited access to European cheese, provided it is on a fair trade basis, the EC has restricted our access, to a far larger market in Europe, to 3,000 tonnes a year with a 24 per cent common external tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the countervailing action that is still in place was undertaken against not just the European Community but other European countries as well, and it was not the first action that had been taken. At that time, through its subsidised exports, it had gained about 20 per cent or more of the domestic cheese market, and the Government reached agreement with it after the EC had been proven to be dumping&mdash;perhaps that is not technically the right term where there is an export subsidy; it shouldould be `export subsidisation'&mdash;and settled for a tariff quota. That was a pretty soft decision in favour of the European Community. For 11,500 tonnes it was required to pay a tariff of $96 a tonne. For anything above that, it was $2,100 a tonne, which more correctly recognised the very extensive level of export subsidy that is provided. If one multiplies the difference between $96 and $2,100 by 11,500 tonnes, it means that the Europeans have been gaining, if you like, $23m better access in the sense of what they have not had to pay one way or another. We, through Customs collections, have lost. So they have got out of that pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Government has accepted the advice of the Senate Committee and, after pressure from us, has now changed its previously absurd three-year sunset arrangement when there is any dumping or countervailing action to a five-year arrangement, which allows for the case to be looked at again to see that, if subsidisation is continuing, the countervailing duty also continues. The industry does have a dilemma: does it go back to trying countervailing again or does it stick with the current arrangement? That is a difficult decision for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point too about the pressure being on the dairy industry longer than on other processed agricultural industries in Australia. It was probably the first to be put under pressure by the supermarkets for generic or home brands. That has been coupled also with pressures on imports by some of the supermarket chains. It is one of the problems that the industry faces at the moment, in spite of improvements to the fair trade procedures. In a coalition government, as we have indicated publicly, we would have far tougher criteria on this question of material injury, which would allow a shorter time span before an application was made and then halve the time after that application was made for both tentative and final duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There still is a problem, and I think it is something that we in the Opposition and the Government have to face up to. It is not just unique to the dairy industry and the case it has with Dutch Edam, which definitely is being export subsidised and sold at far less than a normal selling price here in Australia at the moment. The pig industry and other industries face it. Even when one has a wider ability for an industry to make an application&mdash;that is, one that is affected, such as the farmer with dairy or the pig producer with pork&mdash;unless the processing sector is prepared to provide the necessary information on costs and, therefore, work through to a selling price, et cetera, or unless the supermarkets, if they are the straight importers, are prepared to provide that information, there still is a difficulty in really making the application and reaching a just decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both sides of this House still have to face up to that, and I hope they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Food standards is another area in which the dairying industry was probably subjected to some of these problems earlier than others. The States have been very lax in their determination of these standards. Preservatives which have been banned in Australia because they are supposedly cancer forming have been allowed in imported cheeses. We are never told publicly about the degree of listeria that is uncovered in tests on imported cheese. I am pleased that we now have a National Food Authority and are making progress. I acknowledge that it is up to the States, as the component parts of the National Food Authority, to push a damn sight harder than they are at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor in relation to this legislation is underwriting. The Industry Commission recommended that underwriting be continued. It was the Industry Commission that invented this in the first place, quite a few years ago. The underwriting for dairying is very market-related. There is an eight-year trend line and then 85 per cent of that, and then the IC also recommended a $22m ceiling. I personally support that because I believe that underwriting, when it is in a market related form and whether it is for dairying or for wheat or whatever, is a sensible thing to have in place to provide stability when something happens unfairly in the international market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised that a black hole could occur, and therefore government&mdash;whichever it is&mdash;should be required to act. But usually that is not as immediate or as automatic as if we have something in place. The industry has recognised that, although it would like underwriting to continue, it is not possible to successfully amend the legislation. We could move an amendment, and if it went through the Senate it would mean that the termination date was not proceeded with. But that does not require the Government actually to implement underwriting. The industry, as I said, was aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has made it very plain that it is not prepared to accept the stage management of moving amendments by certain political parties in the Senate to pretend that they are doing something to assist the industry when in reality they cannot, and that it wants the legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underwriting has been triggered only once in the last five or six years&mdash;at the $22m mark in 1991. That was the year in which the Europeans increased their export subsidies, and the bad year for grain. That would have provided a maximum of $4,000 for Victorian and Tasmanian dairy farmers, who are the major beneficiaries of underwriting because they have the greatest export exposure. Let us compare that with the coalition's Fightback policy on reducing costs to farmers by the removal of fuel excise, payroll tax and sales tax. Every year farmers will have their costs reduced by $8,000, and it will not matter whether they are Victorian dairy farmers or Queensland dairy farmers. That is the positive that puts us far ahead of Labor when it comes to total policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also committed to implementing a far better income equalisation deposit scheme. I hope the Government itself is doing that because, although there is stability in relative terms in the dairy industry compared with some others, there still should be better incentives to encourage farmers to take out their own self-insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has obtained the approval of the industry for an increased promotion levy. I know that the industry wants to tread very cautiously with that because there is still very restricted access to Asia for branded and value added products. There are bans on UHT milk in some countries. Companies cannot do their packaging in Australia with their own brand and gain access to some of those markets. There are also higher tariffs. I hope that the Government and the Minister will be sensible with regard to putting pressure on the industry with increased promotion levies, and will work very hard bilaterally as well as through the GATT to overcome some of the restrictions on access to those markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has acknowledged that he is prepared to do some work with regard to getting some uniform State cooperative legislation. I fully support him in that because I have also been having discussions with some of my State colleagues. Cooperatives are essential, I believe, in both the horticultural and dairy industries to provide some leverage and reasonable power for producers. The State restrictions we have at the present time do not allow cooperatives to become national in a sensible way. We all know some of the examples of State legislation having prevented sensible amalgamations of cooperatives from taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties support the legislation because it provides further rationalisation of the industry in the sense of moving to a more internationally competitive position in relation to what it is producing. But we recognise that if anything like a level playing field develops internationally over the next few years&mdash;whether it is for a commercial price for dairy products as distinct from the corrupt price at the present time, or for access on a fair basis to those markets&mdash;the dairying industry in this country has a very great future as an expanded industry and one which will play its part in further exports. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill are focused on the means by which the dairy industry is best able to progress in coming years. They provide a framework for the industry to become more productive, to become more competitive on an international basis and, indeed, to become more aware of and focused on opportunities for the industry to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that the dairy industry has made significant progress in recent years, particularly since the introduction of the Kerin plan in 1986. The aim of that plan was to reduce the level of assistance and to encourage the industry to become more efficient and more competitive. The great majority of people connected with the dairy industry would support the view that the Kerin plan has been greatly successful. National production has increased at the same time as productivity has increased. There has been a moving of the focus of the industry away from bulk commodities into the marketing of more value added products. This gives the industry greater protection from the peaks and troughs of world prices and enhances greater price stability for the products of the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although great progress has been made, to say that the status quo should remain is really to say that further progress cannot be made. Further progress towards greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness can be made. The Government's continuing objective is to develop a more efficient and profitable dairy industry, an industry which is able to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to changes in technology. Only by way of this type of strategy can Australia hope to have a dairy industry that is as large as possible, whilst at the same time viable at an acceptable rate of industry assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to aim our development at both the domestic market and the export market. The local market needs a system that maintains the dominance of the Australian dairy industry through improved competitiveness. In the export market there needs to be a direction that expands our exploitation of the profitable export markets. On the same basis, it means that there must be an ability to identify those export markets which are not profitable in the net sense and turn away from those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills give the dairy industry the direction and the certainty&mdash;and they do so with clarity&mdash;by which it can attain that progress that will maintain its position as a very important and integral part of Australian industry generally through the 1990s. One of the very important aspects of this legislation is that it has been arrived at through negotiation and cooperation with the dairy industry. That process has been noted by the hard work put in by the industry leaders, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and other members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's second reading speech, he compliments the Chairman of the ADIC, Pat Rowley, for the work he has put in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also know that the Caucus primary industries committee met on many occasions with dairy industry representatives from many parts of Australia. I myself met on a number of occasions with dairy industry representatives from the north coast of New South Wales and brought their interests and views to the Minister. The Minister also met with those north coast representatives of the dairy industry at both Casino and Grafton. The ability to negotiate, to give reasonable weight to the just arguments of the industry, was only possible because the Government was not tied to the Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry itself was not able to live with the Industry Commission report. In fact, the Industry Commission report scared the hell out of the industry people whom I spoke to on the north coast of New South Wales. The Government says, as it now says with the Industry Commission report on sugar, that this is not a report which the Government sees as a benchmark or a way of going. The Government said that the Industry Commission report is a document which, while it needs to be considered, should only be considered with reference to and consideration for the way the industry sees itself progressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government did not lock itself inextricably into the Industry Commission report. That the negotiations were successful does credit to the response the industry made to it. The result of those responses is this legislation, which few in the dairy industry have a problem with.

<PARA>He did express some concerns about underwriting. The Government's position on that is that the Commonwealth has contributed to the underwriting of export returns of traditional dairy products when the annual average export price for the product is less than 85 per cent of the trend price for the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underwriting is a conservative mechanism. It has only been used once in the six years of the Kerin plan. Underwriting provides little protection from world price changes as exporters continue to face substantial price movements. Benefits from the new package far exceed those that were given under underwriting. The policy direction of the package is to maintain and promote the health and development of the dairy industry rather than to insulate a few inefficient parties from extreme conditions. Discontinuing underwriting is consistent with Government policy for rural industries exposed to export price variations to take responsibility for their own risk management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the measures in these Bills have a bearing on both assistance and market development. There will be no reduction in market support for another 12 months. There will then be a lowering of market support in equal instalments up to the turn of the century. The market support in that time will be reduced from 22 per cent of parity to 10 per cent of export parity. That is a long way from the figure which was set by the Industry Commission and which is expounded by the Leader of the Liberal Party towards eliminating tariffs, to which the Liberal Party and the National Party have nailed their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the dairy industry has taken note of the Industry Commission report recommending that the cheese tariff quota not be renewed when it ceases on 30 June 1992. The Industry Commission report also recommended that assistance be reduced from its current rate of about 22 per cent above average export price to 5 per cent in 1996. These Industry Commission recommendations are a good distance from the legislation and are much more in line with how the industry sees itself making progress. Of course, those are the things that would have been in place had the National Party and the Liberal Party had their way, tied as they are to the Industry Commission report and to zero tariffs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quorum was called because the honourable member for Page (Dr Harry Woods) misrepresented the Opposition's position on tariff levels in the dairy industry. I will refer to that later in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry faces a very positive future with strong leadership, aggressive marketing by those people involved, and a balance between the domestic demand for milk products and the export potential. After all the debate, the dairy industry in Australia has managed to limit its production to 6.5 billion litres. There have been dramatic changes over the last decade at both the farm and the processing levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when the Kerin plan was introduced in this House in 1986 a similar situation occurred then as is occurring now. The debate was run at the last minute and the guillotine was applied. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, has allowed that to happen again, six years later. This important debate is being guillotined yet again. On the previous occasion the Minister kept putting off the arguments and brought up the legislation at a late stage of the parliamentary sittings. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has a great interest in these matters and is unable to make a contribution to the debate. There are many dairy farmers in his electorate and they are interested in his views. The Minister at the table has ensured that very few speakers will have a go in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bonlac Cooperative, which is an important dairy manufacturing company based in my electorate of Corangamite and the electorate of Wannon, comprises a number of small cooperatives which have merged over the years. Between 1960 and 1980 the Camperdown, Cobden, Glenormiston and Colac cooperatives joined together to make a more efficient operation. Shepparton, Stanhope and Ibis combined in the northern part of Victoria with Amcal to make their operation more effective in that irrigation area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 all those cooperatives combined under the one banner of Bonlac Cooperative. This meant that they had the productive efficiencies of western Victoria, the irrigation area and Gippsland. I note that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) is in the House. The advantages of these cooperatives&mdash;the weather, rainfall, irrigation, proximity to the fresh milk market, the pooling of management resources and the vigorous marketing approach of Bonlac overseas&mdash;have been to ensure that Bonlac is a force in the dairy industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has changed dramatically over the last decade. It has been subjected to many political influences over the last 30 years&mdash;it has now moved away from that&mdash;and government subsidies. The fresh milk market pricing debate which had been going on around capital cities has been sorted out to a lesser or greater degree. There has been a remarkable change in the industry. In 1970 there were 43,000 farms; in 1980, there were about 20,000 farms; and in 1991 there were 15,000 farms working very efficiently. In 1970, production was about 7 billion litres and, in 1991-92, 6.5 billion litres. The industry was hoping to achieve a balance between domestic demand and overseas export possibilities. There are bigger operators in the industry, there is more productivity, there have been improvements in breeding and there have been dramatic improvements in the processing technology at the various cooperative plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairy products are worth about $1.7 billion. Victoria is a key part of the dairy debate, as the Minister at the table would be aware. It accounts for 60 per cent of the production and 12 per cent of that goes to the fresh milk market which is mainly in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. That has always been a threat to the Sydney fresh milk market. To a lesser degree there would be a threat to the Brisbane and Adelaide markets if the market arrangements broke down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victorian producers are world efficient&mdash;as the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has indicated&mdash;because of the climatic conditions. One interesting feature is that members of the Victorian and Australian dairy industry do not house their cows for 4 1/2 months a year as their European competitors do. That is something which we tend to overlook in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Europeans require these massive subsidies to compete at anywhere near the levels of the grass fed animals in Australia. Our new modern processing plants are also making the Australian dairy industry more competitive. Eighty-eight per cent of the product in Victoria is processed into butter, cheese and buttermilk for both the home market and the export market. The Australian industry has been very aggressive in exporting its product overseas and, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said in his second reading speech, 67 per cent of the product is being exported to Asia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Singapore in an aggressive fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important feature for members of this House and the dairy industry to note is the problem of world pricing because of the massive influence of the subsidies of the European Common Market. There are 23 million head of dairy cattle in the European Common Market, a similar number to the total cattle population in Australia. The European subsidies create the world export price and Australian manufacturers are competing with this price. That is the basis of our problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have alluded to the fact that it is important to note that the Australian dairy industry has no tariffs on any imports to Australia. Sometimes in the debate the fact that there is no import tariff quota is overlooked. The base price is created by the very efficient New Zealand industry, which is well organised and has some interesting comparative advantages in terms of rainfall, soil type and the productivity of its dairy herds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key argument relates to the market milk price for domestic consumption and the way in which it is set and the world price of manufactured products which is dominated by the EEC arrangements. The argument then revolves around the all-milk levy of 43c per butterfat kilogram paid to exporters who aggressively sell their product to these markets which have been corrupted by the EEC's operation in setting the world price. The Victorians gain most from this all-milk levy. The counterargument is that the all-milk levy ensures that the Victorians will not predatory price into the more lucrative fresh milk markets in New South Wales and, possibly, other capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate six years ago, the Kerin plan tried to achieve an annual Australian production of 6.5 billion litres. That is a balance between the amount of milk for domestic demand and the amount of milk that can be exported at this stage at a reasonably profitable level. The 43c butterfat figure represents about a 22 per cent tariff support price which will be reduced to about 10 per cent by the year 2000. We have had a vigorous debate about this in the past few minutes. That is compatible with the coalition's negligible tariff levels by the year 2000. That is our policy, and the Minister agrees with it. The coalition has been quite up-front on its position about tariffs in other industries. The Minister made it very clear in his speech that the tariff arrangement is compatible with our position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry requested some underwriting that would give it catastrophe cover. However, that underwriting was utilised only on one occasion in 1991 when $22m was required to ensure that the subsidies of the European Common Market which caused a dramatic fall in the world price were used up. We on this side of the House agree that there is no real need for underwriting because, hopefully, the industry will have its house in order, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a number of discussions with the dairy farmers in Victoria on the fresh milk pricing arrangements. There has always been a major debate about the mechanism for setting the fresh milk price and the contract system which has been removed in Victoria but remains in New South Wales. A statutory authority fixing the price of fresh milk is a problem that will be resolved over time by a more market orientated mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fact that the Victorians became more efficient and had a chance to put pressure on the interstate milk market is demonstrated very well by Mr Davey from the New South Wales Dairy Corporation in his paper to the National Agricultural and Resources Outlook Conference 1991 entitled, `Responding to challenges in the fresh milk market'. I believe he summarises the whole argument with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian challenge is inseparable from other challenges and pressures on the NSW dairy industry that began developing in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most pressing are the demands from retailers and other interested parties for a more flexible system of supply and pricing. Supermarkets' early demands for house brands, 2-litre plastic containers, refrigerated deliveries, centralised billing and volume discounts have been met: they still desire direct access to processors and more flexibility in pricing, and thus support deregulation of zoning and pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a wider perspective, the federal and NSW State governments' thrust for microeconomic reform and deregulation has undoubtedly been part of the impetus for planning more flexible systems. This is clearly the greatest `policy change' that the industry, for so long regulated and protected, must face over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that summarises the arguments that have been going on between the State and Federal Ministers on the balance between fresh milk pricing in Victoria and New South Wales, and the pressure on the threat to changes that were brought about in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the cheese quotas and tariffs, other honourable members have presented our position. We agree with the Government's view on the matter. I draw the attention of the House to the difficulties that the dairy industry has in raising a countervailing duty claim for processed cheese. I make the observation that the whole arrangement where we are competing with the highly subsidised cheese products of Europe and the difficulties of the industry in running these countervailing duties makes it very difficult to handle the products. I also agree with the shadow Minister that the labelling and health standards make it very difficult for the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry faces a very good future, in my view. It has an aggressive marketing attitude in selling its product overseas. It has an attitude that it needs to look after the customer, unlike the wool industry where there is an attitude of mind that those people who buy the product are the villains in the piece. I do commend the dairy industry for its attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The on-farm productivity has been raised dramatically. We now have a situation where there are 300-cow farms and where productivity at the farm level has, as I say, increased dramatically over the past 10 years. We have world standard processing plants that are up to date, that meet standards in hygiene and processing and that will compete with anyone in the world. We have less government involvement. By the year 2000 under this legislation we will have no government involvement at all, and the industry will be standing on its own two feet&mdash;hopefully, profitably, efficiently and viably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that some time has been left for some Government members to respond to some of the comments that have been made in the debate tonight. I am quite pleased to join in this debate on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill. The dairy industry, I guess, goes to the very heart of my electorate on the far north coast. These changes that have come in have been welcomed by the industry. Following my election to the seat of Richmond, the dairy farmers there were one of the first groups to come and compliment me on the action and the results that the Kerin plan has brought to the industry&mdash;the steady nature of the industry and the way it functioned during the time the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, then the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), was overseeing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the dairy farmers did also point out was the fact that the Kerin plan was going to run out very shortly and they were very concerned about the changes that might come in and destabilise that industry. There is no doubt that they were concerned when the Industry Commission report came out and they were most concerned about its recommendations. My colleague the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and I managed to communicate quite a deal with the dairy farmers and the industry leaders on the north coast. I would like to say that we took the message very strongly to the Minister, and I am very pleased that the Minister was able to take on board very strongly the concerns of that area. After all, the north coast dairy industry does face different situations from those faced by the rest of the dairy industry, particularly the Victorian industry of which the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), is part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say that the changes are not all the doings of the north coast industry, though in particular I must say that the changes that have occurred there have essentially been the result of the State governments as it is the State governments throughout Australia that control the marketing of the bulk milk section of that industry. The Victorian industry is essentially organised around the manufacturing side of it and has balanced its industry along those lines. The north coast industry at one stage was written off, much to the chagrin of the dairy industry on the north coast. The one-time Leader of the National Party simply told the industry back in the late 1960s or early 1970s to get big or get out. That was the kind of support that the dairy farmers got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What saved the industry up on the north coast was the State Labor Government with Don Day as the member for Casino who actually got the north coast dairy industry into the Sydney bulk milk market. The industry was saved in those days by the State Labor Government and certainly the industry takes on board that in fact the group of people that has responded again to its interests has been a Labor government, in this case the Federal Labor Government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to read out a few comments from Alan Hoskins, the General Manager of Norco, a major employer in my electorate and the electorate of the honourable member for Page and a great survivor in terms of an employer in the industry. He is a very innovative marketer and certainly a leading light in terms of value adding industries in the dairy industry. Alan Hoskins's comments were printed in the latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Norco Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, some of which I will pass on to the Minister and the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry leaders agree that Mr Crean deserves recognition for his support to an industry which is extremely efficient, which is of major economic importance to this nation. From the industry's standpoint, however, special recognition and thanks must also go to Mr Pat Rowley who has worked tirelessly to drive industry into developing proposals for the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rowley and other members of the dairy industry have been paid due recognition by other speakers tonight and I would like to pass on my compliments to the leaders of the dairy industry for the way they have responded to the IC report and the way that they have put their proposals. I am glad that the Government has been able to take these on board. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the strategies involved here are different from what is involved in the IC report. I would like to pass on the comments of dairy farmers in my electorate, as did the honourable member for Page from his electorate, and their compliments for the way the Government has reacted to this. It has not brought in zero tariffs. It listened to what the industry was after. The industry certainly does retain some fear about the removal of the underwriting&mdash;that being taken out&mdash;but it is certainly prepared to live with that, as it has said. It is pleased that the retention of support is there. The comfort clause obviously has been removed but that is something that it is prepared to live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the National Party also made the comment that the tariffs on cheeses are being removed. To save my getting telephone calls and so forth tomorrow or later tonight from concerned dairy farmers, the tariff at $96 a tonne or the equivalent is to be retained, which is about 2 1/2 per cent. He also mentioned that the cheese tariff quota on overquota cheese, of over the 11,500 tonnes, at $2,100 per tonne, is to be retained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have the grand total time of two or three minutes to try to address this very important and complex Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill before the House. If any of the thousands of dairy farmers in my electorate of Gippsland ask me how much attention the Parliament paid to the most fundamental change to their industry in the last few years, I will tell them that the Government allowed 60 minutes. The Government has allowed 60 minutes for the most structural, fundamental changes to the dairy industry for several years. The Government's contempt for the dairy industry, as for most of the rural industries, is very obvious. Earlier today it allowed 50 minutes for debate on the wool tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have an export industry of $700m per annum, encompassing some 15,000 dairy farmers. It is shameful that a mere 60 minutes have been allowed to publicise many aspects of the dairy industry that need airing and need the attention of the Parliament. The dairy industry gets precious few opportunities to dominate the agenda of the Parliament in the way that is presented by this legislation. It is a tragedy that that opportunity is being lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation represents a tremendous change for the dairy industry, but the dairy industry is used to that; it is nothing new. The dairy industry more than any other industry that immediately springs to mind has been determined to restructure, to become more efficient and to be able to compete on world markets. It has had no choice, naturally, because, if it had not rationalised and restructured, quite frankly it would not be able to compete in the way it is required to do. So there has been a drastic change in the last 15 years or so to the dairy industry, and much of it very painful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There ought to be a recognition by the national Parliament that the dairy industry is at the forefront of changes that will allow it, firstly, to adopt international best practices and, secondly, to compete on a world market. After all, it was the Industry Commission itself that made the point that the most significant source of price competition comes from New Zealand. New Zealand, as we know, is the most efficient manufacturer of dairy products in the world. As there are no tariff or anti-dumping restrictions between our countries, that means that our domestic dairy products are limited to the import parity of the New Zealand product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If time had allowed it, the coalition would have tackled those other worries of the dairy industry, such as the fixed costs. Some 70 per cent of a dairy farmer's costs are beyond the farm gate over which he or she has no control. So it is no good just tackling the legislative framework within which the dairy industry must operate. There is also a need to lower the input costs, whether they be in transport and handling, on the waterfront or on the factory floor itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, which will abolish $20 billion of business taxes, will provide that low cost environment within which the production side of the dairy industry, beyond the farm gate, can cope with the competition, particularly from world markets. So the legislation before the House is supported by the coalition, as it is by the dairy industry. It is a hard-won victory for the dairy industry and is a testimony to its determination to press on legislators the need for this legislative framework. Nonetheless, there still remains the critical factor of what happens beyond the farm gate. Nothing in this legislation will tackle that. Indeed, nothing in the much touted One Nation package, or any other action by this Government, will do anything to increase the profitability of the dairy farm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill. I will deal with the health aspects of the Bill and some of my colleagues will address the other issues a little later, sadly not in depth because of the restraints put upon us by the guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues related to the health portfolio are addressed in this Bill. Many of them are fairly straightforward and have our support. For example, we certainly accept the payment of an increased fee for longer and more complex pathology services. It means that people in intensive care units, for example, will get much better care, something for which we have been pushing for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in the regulations about the ordering of radiology services and the investigation of this to reduce overservicing, fiddling and rorting have always been part of the principles that we would want to reduce the number of fiddlers in the system, the people who waste our money, the people who utilise taxpayers' money for no good purpose. We support these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial penalty on pathologists who fail to advise referring doctors about the fact that their services do not attract Medicare benefits again is something that we have been pushing for and we are happy to accept the legislation as it is proposed. There are some technical amendments which acknowledge health funds now as registered health benefits organisations, which, of course, are fairly straightforward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we need more detailed discussion on some of the issues raised here, some of them fairly straightforward, some more complex. One of the straightforward ones, again a victory for the coalition, is the extension of the PBS safety net card to cover pharmaceuticals dispensed by States in their public hospital systems. Previously, individuals could face two safety nets and pay up to $255 before the safety net came in. As a result of this legislation, which is consequent upon pressure from the coalition, pensioners will now pay up to $135, obviously a more sensible figure. The integration of State and Federal safety nets is something which should have occurred months, if not years, ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some changes refer to the Baume report recommendations. As I think the House is aware, we have generally supported the Baume recommendations. We have been a bit critical lately about the speed of implementation of the recommendations, but we are glad to see that the Government to some extent has listened to some of our criticisms. For example, the redrafting of the TGA regulations followed more or less our suggestions. These relatively minor amendments are quite worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the availability of an AAT appeal if the evaluation is not done in time, but we are still concerned about the relatively poor state of the evaluation process and the times involved in this. For example, a number of drugs are still creaking very, very slowly through the evaluation system, in spite of the recommendations in the Baume report. I could list probably a dozen or so without any trouble at all, but let me focus on two particular issues and one general area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised in this House before the question of neupogen. On a previous occasion, I mentioned that this drug allows cancer treatment to be much more effective&mdash;indeed, it can be potentially life saving&mdash;and the fact that it had a very slow progress through the TGA bureaucracy. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) actually accused me of waving the shroud. Let me say that neupogen has now been approved&mdash;there are at present no funds for it, but at least it has been approved. Sadly, however, it was too late for the lady that I mentioned in the House, Janty Nicholson, who had breast cancer and needed the drug; she was unable to get it via the system and had to bypass it. Janty died about two weeks ago as a result, indirectly, of not being able to get access to neupogen. With great sadness I inform the House of Janty Nicholson's sad death and offer my condolences to her lovely family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the question of Intron A. Intron A is a drug which is the only available treatment for hepatitis C. It has been approved in some 17 other countries and in many countries has been available since 1988. The application to Australia's ADEC was made in December 1990, over 365 working days ago. That far exceeds Peter Baume's recommendation that the evaluation of this class of drugs should take 195 days; so it has taken over twice as long as recommended and still there is no completion in sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even worse because Intron A has been approved for a number of other conditions&mdash;hairy cell leukaemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, genital warts and basal cell carcinoma&mdash;so there is no question about the drug being safe; it is a perfectly safe drug, but the bureaucracy cannot plough through it quickly enough to approve its use for a condition where it is clearly indicated and for which there is no alternative treatment. Something like 100,000 patients in Australia are currently suffering from the condition, which may in many cases be a potentially fatal disease. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very strict criteria for genotrophin, a synthetic growth hormone. A young boy in my electorate called William Somadelis has had trouble with access. He is a short child, but he does not satisfy the strict criteria. Although all his doctors believe he is a genuine candidate for genotrophin growth hormone, he does not satisfy the wording of the criteria. His parents have found the resources to pay over $5,000 for a course of this drug. Fortunately at this stage he has had a good response to it. He is starting to grow and his height may become within the normal percentile, but it is very sad that the guidelines in this particular case are so restrictive that his parents, who are not well off at all, have to find thousands of dollars and indeed in this situation are having to face mortgaging their house to raise the money to make sure that their child reaches normal height. This should not happen under any health system, particularly under one vaunted by the Government as being good for the whole population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue in general terms is the question of therapeutic devices. The device manufacturers tell me very categorically that since the recent changes in the introduction of fees the processing time for their approvals has actually increased, it has actually deteriorated in many cases. On top of that they are now being faced with increased fees over the next couple of months. I understand, if my information is correct, and I understand it is&mdash;it comes from a very reliable source; it certainly does not come from the Government, which never takes the trouble to inform us of these proposed changes&mdash;that the Government is proposing in some categories a 200 per cent fee increase for the approval processes in different categories of therapeutic devices. So in effect they are paying 200 per cent more in some categories and an increase in most categories for a worse service. Our view and the view of the industry is that it is happy to pay increased fees if it gets a better service. Sadly in this situation they are not only getting a worse service, they are also having to pay more for it. That is entirely inappropriate. </PARA>

We believe that the rights of Parliament in this case should be paramount. We would oppose these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issue, however, is of course the question of the co-payments. I do not have to deliver the details of the saga about the co-payments to this House. Honourable members are fully aware of the humiliating somersault that has been forced upon the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. The Minister said early in August that Medicare was `unsustainable'&mdash;I use his own word&mdash;without these changes;  that the co-payment was indeed the cornerstone of the Government's reform; yet he has had a humiliating backdown, a policy somersault, forced upon him by the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as part of the deal for his ascension to the Prime Ministership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some great ironies here because the factional deals involved an assessment by many in the Labor Party that the public would so much abhor a fee for service and the absence of free medicine that there would be an electoral backlash. The AGB survey figures indicate that 70 per cent of the public actually supported a contribution, and 61 per cent specifically supported the $2.50 charge and thought it was reasonable. Thirty-four per cent thought it was unreasonable, but 69 per cent of pensioners thought it was reasonable. This is an indication of the common sense of the general public in Australia. The other problem to the Government is that this humiliating backdown, this policy somersault, which is one of the last nails in the coffin of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, will cost the taxpayer $707m by 1995. Just think what could be done with $707m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another interesting AGB survey report, 53 per cent of those surveyed and 73 per cent of pensioners reported that there was no increase in the fees charged by GPs after the appropriate time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other myths still being propagated which are not being addressed in this Bill. The Medicare levy provides for only about 18 or 19 per cent of the costs of health in Australia. There is an appalling lack of funds. There is a major crisis in the Australian health system. At the recent Australian Health Ministers Advisory Conference there was a revolt by both Labor and Liberal State Health Ministers in regard to that. The three conservative Ministers for Health refused to support the principles of the Medicare agreement. Keith Wilson, the Minister for Health in Western Australia, was critical then and was even more critical at a meeting in Melbourne today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seriously sick Australians are daily unable to gain access to needed hospital treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tragedy is that the people who are most affected are the aged and those on low incomes with chronic disease. What we are seeing is the growing failure of Hospital Medicare to protect the most vulnerable members of the community&mdash;the exact opposite of the original objectives of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that the number of people on Perth teaching hospital waiting lists since 1988 has grown by more than 40 per cent. Currently 11,500 people are waiting for treatment in those hospitals. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that hospital Medicare is not the fair and just system that it promised to be, and has not been since its inception.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not some right wing propagandist; this is not a right wing think-tank or a Liberal or National Party member; this is the Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia, supported by his own Department and by his Premier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else is happening that is worrying? There is a campaign by the Private Hospitals Association against the current system. More interestingly, there is a campaign by the Public Hospitals Association and the AHA, the Australian Hospitals Association. It has about 650 members, about 620 of which are public hospitals. The Labor Party now says that we need to emphasise private health insurance, that we need to encourage people to look after themselves. This, of course, is the very thrust of Fightback in general and of our health policy in particular. We will remove the pressure from the public system and increase the occupancy rates of the private system to the benefit of both systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent AMA conference, not entirely attended by AMA members, supported the coalition's health policy very strongly. Something like 90 per cent of the attendees of that conference supported the principles of the coalition's health policy: that there should be a pricing on it; that there should be a review of the medical benefits system and that there should be incentives for private health insurance. There seems to be little doubt that the right way to go is the way in which we have pointed. There should be an indication that there is an incentive for taking out private health insurance to look after oneself, to take people off the waiting lists, and to move them away from the overcrowded public system into the private system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AHIAA figures indicate that there is about 82 per cent public support for rebates for private health insurance premiums.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighty-eight per cent of the people surveyed believed that more people would take out private health insurance if tax rebates were offered.

All we have is more blunders from the Minister for Health; we have a litany of blunders. </PARA>

He blamed the incorrect figures on his Department when that was clearly not the case; he just did not understand what was going on. He subsequently put out press releases on the wrong figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand in strong support of the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which incorporates significant aspects of housing, aged care, Medicare and health services in Australia. My colleagues will touch on some of these issues. I will address one of the most important facets of this Bill&mdash;the reforms and forward planning arising out of the Disability Services Act, adding another major step to those taken in recent years to correct the century long neglect of people with disabilities in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since taking office in 1983, the Government has been instrumental in making Australia's commitment to the rights of people with a disability a reality. Sweeping reforms have been introduced to enable people with disabilities to have exactly the same rights, opportunities and freedoms as those which are generally available to the Australian public. These have been a direct response to increasing calls from the community for a greater focus on individuals and greater control over how services are delivered and public resources used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the report of the handicapped programs review, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Directions</EMPHASIS>, set out a range of proposals for the improvement of services for people with disabilities. This was followed in 1987 by the enactment of the Disability Services Act, along with its principles and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Disability Services Act has led to the development of services which not only provide basic support for people but also, by law, enhance the dignity and worth of individuals. The Government's commitment to social justice and human rights demands that we begin to shape systems to fit the needs of individuals rather than try to shape individuals to fit the systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 12 months the focus of the disability services program has shifted, quite properly, from a concern about how services and supports are provided to asking what individuals with a disability need and want, and how they might be assisted in meeting their own goals. As well as providing better chances for people with disabilities to gain employment, the disability reform package makes certain that people with severe disabilities, those who may have more limited job prospects, will receive adequate and secure income support. The employment initiatives developed under the disability reform package are the surest way out of poverty and social marginalisation for people with disability. They are also the most effective and image-enhancing way of removing barriers to participation and enabling people with a disability to play an effective and valued role in the society's work force. This will surely enrich the whole society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will highlight some of the changes. The reform is designed to provide income support for those who are unable to participate in the labour market and every encouragement and opportunity for people with a disability to participate in society and to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The employment services funded under the Disability Services Act are an integral part of the reform package. The package includes 4,000 new employment places in Commonwealth funded services and 4,500 new places under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service over the three years ending 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1990, minimum standards for all services, known as minimum outcomes, were established. These minimum outcomes are designed to ensure the protection of fundamental human and consumer rights in the areas of grievance mechanisms, privacy safeguards, individualised planning, decision making, choice and employee rights. Over 99 per cent of services have now said either that they now meet the minimum outcomes or they will meet them by 30 June 1992. The Government welcomes this news. This represents a significant increase in the overall service quality over the last 18 months. For those few organisations that have not met the minimum outcomes by that deadline, it is important that they know that they will not be closed down. Rather, departmental officers will work closely with the organisation to help it establish the framework for the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drafting of the second stage, which builds on the minimum outcomes, was commenced last year. Again, the families, carers, advocates and service providers will be asked to express their comments. Services will be assisted to meet the second stage of standards, set for 30 June 1995. This process reinforces the Government's confidence in service providers, their abilities and their commitment to providing the best possible services for their consumers. The Government remains committed to increasing the quality of service for people with a disability and to a broad quality assurance approach. The introduction of service standards and ways to check whether services are meeting these represent only the core elements of an effective and comprehensive quality assurance system that protects the rights and the quality of life of people with a disability and drives for continuing improvement. This is a key element of the Government's ongoing social justice commitment in the area of disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment about sheltered workshops. In spite of the Government's achievements, the Opposition has tried on a number of occasions to amend the Disability Services Act in ways which would reduce the opportunities for people with a disability and which would waste the resources set aside for supporting people with a disability. One example is its insistence on specifically including sheltered workshops as an endorsed model of service delivery under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that for some people, such as those who have been working in sheltered workshops for over 20 years, the transition to employment is very difficult. Such people will not be left without a service or forced into an employment option against their wishes. However, to suggest that resources should be directed to providing more sheltered workshops is wasteful. Against any measure, open employment services are a far better investment of Commonwealth moneys, especially considering that sheltered workshops and open employment services assist people with a similar support-need profile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cost efficiency helps no-one, least of all the people with a disability for whom services are provided. For instance, according to the 1991 census of disability services, the Government provides an annual average of $1,800 per consumer placed in open employment service and $2,400 per consumer in a sheltered workshop. But the average weekly wage for persons with a disability in open employment, the cheaper service, is some $217, whereas in the sheltered workshops, the dearer service, it is around only $41. While the Government's assistance is for support costs and not for wages, it is interesting to note that, for every dollar the Government provides for assisting someone into open employment, there is another amount for&mdash;excuse me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The Minister did not type this. For every dollar the Government provides for assisting someone into open employment that person receives, on average, $6.26 in wages. I am sorry, I lost that figure for the moment. Yet for every dollar given to sheltered workshops the consumer receives an average of only some 88c in wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For existing sheltered workshops, the Government wants to work with them to continually improve service quality. The Government is not about closing down or defunding services and consequently leaving people with a disability without support. Neither, however, is it about locking service providers into a particular method of service delivery which is not appropriate to the needs and aspirations of people with a disability. New employment services should ensure the rights which we all enjoy and expect as Australians: a fair day's pay for a fair day's work; a safe working environment; and respect for labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any employment service, regardless of the model of service delivery, which meets the standard and the principles and objectives can be funded under the Act. The Government is not about dictating to individual services what particular model or approach to service delivery they should adopt. However, the Government does have clear expectations about consumer outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what does the Bill do in the area of standards, quality assurance and equity? Despite the massive increase in funding in past years, demand for disability services still exceeds supply. Given this, it is vitally important that services are accessed by those most in need and that the resources of the disability services program are allocated as equitably as possible. The existing submission based system of allocating resources has resulted in an unequal distribution of disability services across regions and among social groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer focused funding approach, CFFA, and needs based planning are two initiatives which are being developed to address this inequity. Needs based planning involves the collection and analysis of information on where people with a disability live, what their needs may be and the existing supply of services to meet those needs. This information, in conjunction with community consultation on needs, will give the program a better idea of those areas which have the greatest need for resources. Under CFFA, the level of funding for new service providers is based on an assessment of the type and level of support required by each individual using that service. Funds may not be used for any other person and may transfer to another similar service if the person with the disability chooses to receive assistance from another agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for me to note that the Government recognises that there are needs for people 18 years of age and over. There are other needs outside those which we are addressing. It is important for to us fill in the gaps of neglect that have existed over the years. We are doing so energetically on a one-to-one basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of reforms continues the original vision of the Disability Services Act.

I am very pleased to be following the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) because later I will touch on some of her scurrilous accusations about our amendments. I believe it would be useful to run through some of the background to the proposed amendments to the Disability Services Act and to give the coalition's position on the Act since its implementation in 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act was passed in December 1986 with the support of all parties. The Act replaced the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974. The Disability Services Act was accompanied by a statement of principles and objectives, setting out the right of people with disabilities to individual respect, freedom of choice and fulfilment of their individual potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act came into effect on 1 July 1987. The key element of the new program was integration of the disabled into the community through increased independence and greater employment opportunities. It was proposed that implementation of the Act would take place over a five-year period to 30 June 1992, during which time consultations would take place with all people concerned with disability services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as 1988&mdash;just one year after the Act came into effect&mdash;the coalition, particularly the then shadow Minister for community services, my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), cautioned against too quick a change. He said that for some it would take time to adapt. That note of caution was not heeded by the Government, and it is pleasing to see some of that concern being addressed in this Bill. In 1989 the honourable member for Dawson spoke about the concern and confusion among relatives of people with a disability and service providers during the transition period of the DSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of the Act presented considerable difficulties, not least because of the inflexible interpretation of the Act by the bureaucrats, their insufficient depth of understanding of the legislation and their lack of skills to implement the requirements in both the government and non-government sectors. Other reasons included the uncertainties of funding during the transition period; the fact that changes in concepts and principles have created fear and confusion amongst parents; the lack of communication and understanding between governments and the non-government sector; and the fact that the Department for Health, Housing and Community Services has undergone almost continuous and massive restructuring since 1984, which has created considerable tension with the voluntary organisations, and a lack of continuity and consistency of departmental decisions. Also it has tended to leave the departmental staff less professional than required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989 the coalition has attempted to provide solutions to these problems. In November of that year the honourable member for Dawson presented a draft Bill to Parliament proposing amendments to the Disability Services Act. In November 1990 he presented a private member's Bill proposing similar amendments. In September 1991 he again presented this Bill proposing the same amendments, but the Government provided no opportunity for its fuller debate and acceptance. In April this year he presented the Bill yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For almost three years, on behalf of people with disabilities, parents and service providers, the coalition has been pressing the Government to accept the fact that the 1986 Act was not immutable, that change was needed and that a greater degree of certainty and compassion is required in the administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intolerable that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has allowed so many carers and people with disabilities to suffer for so long the stress of not knowing whether their services will continue after June 1992 and what service guidelines will follow. As the architect of the Act, the former Senator Don Grimes, said as recently as February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles and objectives that were set out in the disability services legislation in 1986 are as clear and as sensible as can be found in most places. But I must remind those involved, as I used to at the time, that they are but standards and guidelines to help in the development of programs to assist people to fill their developments in society. They are no more than that.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Government, the Minister and the bureaucracy have set their own agenda, creating uncertainty and risking the lifestyles of so many disabled Australians. The coalition has continually urged the Government to amend the Act to provide more flexibility and more certainty to people with disabilities, their families and their service providers. We proposed that guidelines be formulated and brought before Parliament for debate, and amended if necessary, so that the criteria for funding of services would be clearly laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also proposed that the transition date, the period in which financial assistance for prescribed services and for upgrading prescribed services is payable, be extended to give existing services more time to adapt to the requirements of the DSA. Our amendments also provided for security of contracts between the Government and the service provider, and an appeals procedure. We also proposed that the service-type `supported employment services' be amended to include specifically work crews, small businesses, enclaves, individual supported jobs and sheltered workshops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act has opened up new options for people with disabilities, and this the Opposition applauds and approves. However, we believe that there is still a need for services such as sheltered workshops, hostels, nursing homes and activity therapy centres to be able to coexist alongside the new service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has stated that he and his Department are examining alternative services for people with severe disabilities who will never be able to participate fully in the open work force. Until an alternative service is in place, we strongly believe that, if sheltered workshops were not an option, it would be denying many people with disabilities the right to work, the right to training, the right to gain living skills and the right to a choice. They would be sentenced to an existence of boredom and frustration at home, with the consequent stresses on their families and carers. The honourable member for Lilley said that our amendment does not address this problem and that we would be denying these people access to those services. That is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last November the Minister outlined his blueprint for action for disability services. He stated that he would amend the Disability Services Act. He told the ACROD conference that the transition date of 1992 would be removed but that he would require all types of services, including sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and large accommodation services, to meet certain standards by 1995 in order to continue to be eligible for funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also stated that he would formulate and table the section 5 guidelines. One of the major amendments proposed in this Bill recognises that the five-year transition period was not long enough to deal with the complexity of change required. The Bill removes the transition date and provides ongoing funding to prescribed services&mdash;that is, services in existence pre-1987, such as sheltered workshops, accommodation services and activity therapy centres&mdash;provided they meet minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents and disability service providers welcome this amendment. Section 14(1)(a) of the amending Bill provides a safeguard for those who believe that this amendment will take away any inducement on the part of services to progress and offer greater educational and training opportunities to people with disabilities. This section provides that the Minister may terminate funding to a prescribed service&mdash;presumably, if it is not meeting required standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill removes the restriction on funding for profit organisations. This allows the Minister to fund, on a case by case basis, services that are provided by other than non-profit organisations. Some organisations in the voluntary sector are concerned about this amendment and believe it to be unnecessary. The Minister states that it will assist in the provision of attendant care services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out that under existing legislation there should be no reason why non-profit organisations approved by the Minister should not engage in private for profit attendant care services in meeting service delivery needs in accordance with their contract with the Government. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary organisations such as the Endeavour Foundation provide immeasurable support to the disabled and their families. The Endeavour Foundation is 76 per cent self-funded; the Government's contribution amounts to 24 per cent. This figure reflects the determination and commitment of the volunteers and representatives of the Foundation who tirelessly coordinate continual fund raising projects. I cannot speak highly enough of all such voluntary organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the objects of the Disability Services Act to clarify that the disability services program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are assistance programs that operate within budget constraints. For any government there is only so much money available, and there will never be enough to fund all programs to everyone's satisfaction. Much as we would like the disability services program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to be entitlement programs, in reality they are not, and cannot be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we would request clarification of the new subsection 5(g)(2)(b) which states that due regard must be had for the need to consider equity and merit in accessing these resources. We hope that this applies to the actual services provided, and that all people with disabilities requiring a service will receive a service, but that those services for people with severe and multiple disabilities that may require substantial resources are still able to have access to those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has stated publicly that he will formulate and table guidelines under section 5 of the Disability Services Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in entering the debate on the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. This is an omnibus Bill which makes a series of amendments to a raft of legislation in the areas of health, housing and therapeutic goods. Included amongst those amendments are important amendments such as giving legislative base to the agreement between the States and the Commonwealth about the safety nets to achieve a joint Commonwealth-State safety net for pharmaceutical drugs. This is important from the aspect of clarifying for the patients&mdash;the consumers&mdash;how they can go about getting proper treatment, and not leaving them to worry about which sphere of government has the constitutional responsibility for the institution from which they are getting treatment or drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I wish to discuss the disability services aspects of this legislation. May I say from the outset that yet again the honourable member for Maranoa, in leading for the Opposition, has used the type of tactic that we see often in discussions on disability services matters and matters of aged care policy, where we take what is perceived to be a vulnerable group and use that sort of scare tactic in discussions in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go to the basis of the Government's actions in the disability services area, what has to be remembered is that this Labor Government has brought with it into office a vision for social justice; a vision for a fairer, more prosperous and just society in which every Australian receives a fair share of the nation's wealth. This vision remains unaltered. It is the light on the hill that the Labor Party has worked towards over the past 100 years. It calls for a society with an equitable distribution of economic resources; equality of civic and legal rights; fair and equal access to essential services such as housing, health and education; and the opportunity for every member of society to participate in community life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One measure of our maturity as a society is the extent to which disadvantaged groups are encouraged and are able to share in the responsibilities and benefits of society. In this context this Government has done more for people with a disability than any government before it. The Disability Services Act of 1986, which was introduced by this Government, is regarded internationally as a great step forward in legislative support for people with a disability and the services that support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against many other competing priorities, the Government has increased funding for disability services since 1983 from $104m to $279m and will increase this further to $383m by 1996. This represents an increase of over 60 per cent in real terms, and an almost fourfold improvement in dollar terms towards the provision of practical support for people with a disability. The introduction of the Act has seen an unprecedented number of people with a disability receive support under Commonwealth funded programs and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's 1991 census of disability services reports that there are more than 94,000 consumers of Commonwealth funded disability services. This is a 173 per cent increase over the 1986 census. Ultimately, we are striving towards social justice for all Australians so that people with a disability can participate fully in economic, social and political life and can determine and control the direction of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now contrast this with the Opposition's vision and an Opposition agenda which wishes to save money. This Government's achievements and vision stand in stark contrast to the Opposition's proposals. While the Government sees the achievement of human rights for people with a disability as a necessary investment for Australia, the Opposition's agenda appears to be to return Australia to its inefficient and paternalistic past&mdash;as the honourable member for Lilley put it earlier in the debate, a century of neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Opposition wants to spend less on programs for people with a disability is a matter that is on the public record. For instance, the explanatory memorandum relating to the private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the Disability Services Amendment Bill 1989, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . expenditure . . . would not exceed current intended expenditure, and may well be less.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Maranoa in his contribution tonight even confirmed that and suggested that more funds are unlikely to be put towards disability services. Not only does the Opposition want to cut expenditure on programs for people with a disability; it also wants to put unworkable administrative arrangements in place. For some time now the honourable member for Dawson, in his former capacity as the Opposition spokesperson in this area, had been proposing amendments to the Act concerning the details of funding agreements between the Commonwealth and service providers. The proposed amendments would limit the areas which may be covered in such funding agreements. Whatever the intent of these amendments, their outcome would result in the maladministration of Commonwealth funds. The Opposition's proposals would prevent the Minister making terms or conditions of grant to cover those situations where the welfare and safety of service users is jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the great majority of service providers are working in the interests of the service users, unfortunately there have been occasions where service users have suffered abuse. In such a situation, the Government needs the power to terminate the grant and transfer the funding to another agency in respect of the service users. Under the Opposition's amendments, the Government would be bound to continue funding the abuse of people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only would the Government be unable to address a proven case of abuse, but the Opposition's amendments would also prevent the Government from reviewing what is being achieved through the financial assistance it is providing. Departmental officers would be unable to inspect a service, organisations providing services would not be required to take out appropriate insurance, the Commonwealth would not be indemnified or protected from misrepresentations and so on. Such provisions in funding agreements are the backbone of sound financial management. One can easily imagine the outcry if a similar legislative requirement were placed on all commercial contracts. Why, then, place it on the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people with interests in this area have expressed concern about the consistency of decision making under the disability services program and have suggested that decisions under the Act be made subject to review by the AAT&mdash;the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The introduction of administrative guidelines and clear objective standards under the Act will result in fair and consistent decision making. In addition, the Government's Bill will establish an independent disability standards review panel to provide an independent merits based review. This will apply in those situations where the Minister plans to sanction a service provider that he or she considers is not meeting the applicable standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with respect to funding decisions, the Attorney-General's Department has identified a number of situations where an AAT review is inappropriate. These situations include decisions which grant financial assistance to States or Territories and decisions made against a finite or limited amount of money where a review decision to give money to one applicant would affect the decisions to grant money to the other applicants. Grants under the Disability Services Act can be made to States and Territories, and funding decisions are made against a fixed amount of money. Consequently, AAT review is inappropriate for funding decisions under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's amendments go beyond proposing AAT review of funding decisions. They propose both AAT review and review by the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of decisions made in connection with the administration of part 2 of the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer burden of this requirement would smother productivity. Written statements of reasons could be sought or appeals lodged over any administrative action: for instance, `Why did the departmental officer not visit my service?', `The departmental officer did not provide me with enough assistance in writing a funding application', `Why does the Government not review my service every six months?', and so on. As a consequence, departmental officers could spend all of their time dealing with appeals and statements of reasons. No time would be left for assisting people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to achieve meaningful and enduring reforms, there must be cooperation and participation in the reform process at all levels of society. In Australia an unprecedented partnership between people with disabilities, their families, all spheres of government, service providers, employers and unions is resulting in a significant change in opportunities for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is committed to providing people with disabilities with the same rights and opportunities as are available to other Australians. The Government's reforms are not isolated initiatives which will have only a transitory impact on the lives of people with a disability. They are the foundations of this Government's vision for a fairer and more just society in which people with disabilities are equal participants. The Government's amendments to the Disability Services Act will continue this vision of justice and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility of all Australians to work together to achieve a society in which people with disabilities are accepted as ordinary citizens with the same rights as all others in the community, in which they can gain and hold meaningful employment with wages and career opportunities which reflect their abilities, and in which control by people with a disability over their own bodies, lives and futures is assumed and assured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill in relation to aged care and nursing homes. First of all, I pay tribute to my predecessor in this portfolio area, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who is present in the House and who put forward a private member's Bill in the area of disability services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has seen fit to make a number of party political points relating to proposals put forward by my colleague. The honourable member for Dawson has discussed these matters quite extensively with the providers and the consumers of services in this disability area and has not taken a partisan political view on these matters. As everybody knows, the Government's proposals in this area&mdash;and, more particularly, the way they have been administered by the Department, with particular views taken in the Department&mdash;have been a matter of considerable difficulty. Anyone listening would not understand from the speech made by the honourable member for Scullin that the proposals put forward by the honourable member for Dawson had overwhelming support from those actually involved in the delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to take a party political view on the proposals put forward by the Government within the area of nursing homes. In fact, the Opposition will support these. The problem of care of the aged is a national problem, one on which there has been quite a deal of agreement across parties. It is an area which I know reasonably well, having had the responsibility for administering nursing homes as Minister for Health in the Fraser Government and understanding the difficulties we had with the 1973 legislation and the changes that had to be made after we left. It was a pity there was a gap of about two years after we left in which virtually nothing was done and we lost a lot of ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the specific proposals in the Bill to which I wish to refer relates to pre-admission leave for nursing home residents. Currently, nursing home residents have the capacity to take 28 days of recreation leave a year without the proprietor of the nursing home losing any nursing home benefits. Unfortunately, none of these days of leave are available to the person on immediate admission to the nursing home. This means that, unless a person is able to take up immediate residence when notified that he or she is able to go into a home, there is a loss of income to the proprietor. This proposal quite sensibly says that they can take some of the 28 days&mdash;I think up to two&mdash;getting themselves ready to go in. It is a perfectly sensible proposal, which we support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item refers to the disclosure of information to prospective purchasers of nursing homes. If a person is about to buy a nursing home, he really needs to know something about it. Currently the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act prevent the disclosure by the Department of information relating to a nursing home to a prospective purchaser. This Bill, quite sensibly, makes that information available. Obviously, if a person is going to buy a nursing home he does not want to buy a pig in a poke. He needs essential information from the Department, and this allows that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) a very important concern of purchasers of nursing homes relating to validation problems. The system of validation means that, after the expiry of a particular period of funding, the Department is called upon to examine the accounts of the nursing home to see whether the moneys which have been advanced have been properly expended. It can call upon the nursing home to return moneys which are not properly acquitted. Because of backlogs and so on in some cases it will be a number of years before this takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present arrangements the purchaser of a nursing home is held liable for moneys which need to be returned following a validation which has been unsatisfactory from the proprietor's point of view. This seems to me to be a problem that the Government ought to look at. It seems somewhat unfair&mdash;even after this disclosure, which we support, has been put in place&mdash;that there could easily be information which would not be available until after the validation has taken place. It is probably more equitable if the original proprietor were liable for the shortfall rather than that being applied to the incoming proprietor who may have had no knowledge of the underlying circumstances of that shortfall. I ask the Minister to look at that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point relates to records to be kept by the former proprietors for 12 months after sale so that they can be inspected. That is a perfectly reasonable provision, again which we support. The fourth item relates to the transfer of nursing home beds. When approval in principle for transfer of beds from one nursing home to another is asked for, it will be subject to a condition that the proprietor of the home yielding the beds continues to comply with nursing home conditions of approval. I am a little at a loss to understand why this is necessary because the Department can impose these conditions anyway. It has to supervise the standards of nursing homes and it can withdraw approvals for them if standards are not right. In this case, I suppose it gives extra leverage. If a person wants to dispose of a nursing home, he is prevented from doing so if he does not fully comply with nursing home conditions. One would think that, if he was not complying with those conditions anyway, other action can be taken. Nonetheless, we support this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth item relates to the divulgence of information to receivers or liquidators. Again, the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act prevent the Department from letting receivers or liquidators know very important information about the operation of a particular nursing home. Similarly to the second provision on disclosure of information to prospective purchasers, it would seem that the Department should make this information available to receivers or liquidators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested in the fact that this item has been put in at a time when the Minister is denying that receivership or liquidation is very much a problem for nursing homes. At the moment because of the funding arrangements and the inadequacies of the SAM component, if I can use a technicality&mdash;the overhead component of nursing home funding&mdash;a number of nursing homes are in serious threat of receivership or liquidation. Some of them are already in that position. The Minister is denying that that is the case. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that there is this particular provision in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking on the fifth aspect of the Bill, I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are serious inadequacies in the present funding proposals. They are still unresolved after a very long period of negotiation between the nursing home associations and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of nursing homes in three States are in dire straits because the matter has not been resolved. We think that the Government is looking at it. I will be very interested to know exactly how the Government will deal with this matter. It strikes me that the underlying reasons for this difficulty are more complicated than the Government is prepared to admit. I am not sure how it is going to deal with it within the present framework of funding for nursing homes. I merely advise the House that the Opposition expresses grave concern about the inadequacies of the SAM component of funding and that it is quite sceptical of claims made by the Minister that the matter is truly under review and will be dealt with as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are on the very verge of bankruptcy. The major problems seem to be in the State of Victoria, although there are problems in two other States, as I am informed. I press the Minister, in his reply, to give some information as to the progress of the inquiry because people really are at the abyss in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not taking a highly partisan view on this extremely important matter of care for the aged. Generally speaking, the proposals for change made by the Government are practical and sensible ones. Unlike the honourable member for Scullin, we do not seek to make political points but support sensible changes&mdash;as the Opposition is always prepared to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As other speakers in the debate have mentioned already, the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill that seeks to amend a number of Acts in that portfolio area. For instance, part 2 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 which are designed to improve the standard of service provided to disabled people by Commonwealth-funded organisations. I note that my colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) spoke on that matter earlier. I also understand that the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) spoke about the aspects of the Bill which deal with disability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 covers amendments to the Health Insurance Act to discourage excessive ordering of diagnostic imaging services by practitioners, more broadly defined; and part 6 extends the safety net arrangements contained in part VII of the National Health Act 1953 to enable medication supplied through outpatient departments of State public hospitals and repatriation hospitals to be counted towards the threshold for the issue of concession and entitlement cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is part 7 of the Bill that I want to concentrate on this evening. I note that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) also referred to it when he discussed the administration of nursing homes under the aged and community care program. I am delighted to support the measures in that part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's record of achievement in aged care is outstanding. We inherited a system that was lopsided, inequitable, costly and ineffective. It is no accident that we now have a network of aged care services that is the equal of anywhere in the world and better than in most other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a few short years this Government's aged care program has been able to develop the type of care that most frail elderly people need and want&mdash;and indeed the families of most frail elderly people would want such care for them&mdash;that is, the care to help them remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The home and community care program has enabled vital services, such as home nursing, home care, meals on wheels, home maintenance services and transport services to expand significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1984, expenditure on the home and community care program has increased by a massive 240 per cent. I point out to honourable members in the House&mdash;although I am sure that many of them are aware of this&mdash;that the home and community care program is very popular in the community. Although some old people who live in their homes are not aware of all of the services that are available&mdash;the home maintenance service, for instance, which is often available through local councils&mdash;this is because the council has not publicised the service sufficiently, not because the service is not available or not being funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that there are now small hostels in the community where people who are suffering from senile dementia, for instance, are able to be looked after and supervised but not treated like invalids. That is the distinction which used to be made&mdash;they were either treated as mentally ill or as invalids. Neither of those forms of treatment were very suitable for a person who was frequently hale and hearty physically but not always able to remember and, in a continuing fashion, not able to function as well as they previously could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my constituents, who is a blind man, has a wife with senile dementia. He has to try to look after her. It causes him considerable anxiety. He is comforted to know that should he ever require her to be placed in a hostel to relieve the stress on him, that would be possible. I commend the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) for the changes and the improvements that have been made in that area of home and community care and in hostel care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the program has enabled the pressure to be taken off nursing homes. Many frail aged people are now able to stay at home rather than go to a nursing home when they do not really need to. That is a much more appropriate care for the person, as well as being cheaper in terms of the cost to the community at large. Nursing home care is now more readily available for the seriously ill or disabled older person who genuinely needs around the clock nursing care. It is horses for courses; the right sort of care for the person's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aged care measures in this Bill are particularly concerned with nursing homes. Not long ago our society regarded such homes as places where people went to die. One euphemistic description which was used was `God's waiting rooms'. We all now believe&mdash;I think we always should have&mdash;that our aged citizens deserve much better than that. A person who enters a nursing home should be able to do so in a dignified and self-respecting manner. A nursing home resident should be able to maintain as normal a life as possible and still be able to feel that he or she is part of the wider Australian community. Often, this means that residents will need help from the home's staff, their families or friends. It also means that the resident will have to feel secure in their new home and free to move between the nursing home and the wider community as they desire and as their frailty allows. This is definitely improving. This Bill helps that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the Government has introduced several important initiatives to ensure that the care that our older Australians receive in nursing homes is of the highest standard. Many of these initiatives have seen Australia leading the world in this most important area. For instance, from 1987 outcome standards have been introduced to see that the quality of care is of a uniformly high standard. I recall that Senator Pat Giles was very involved in a Senate committee which undertook a study in this area. The quality of care in Australian nursing homes was not uniformly good, but legislation is now there to ensure quality of care. I think that all people who have elderly parents or elderly relatives would be relieved to see that that occurred some time ago.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment is now available. With staffing levels being improved, nursing home staff can ensure that all residents with the same level of dependency receive the same level of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing its program of aged care reforms, the Government has also been aware that the final decisions as to how to deliver the care should be made only by those in the best position to do so. The people who should make these decisions are, of course, professional and very dedicated people who staff nursing homes and the residents themselves. It has been easy in the past for people not to consult with residents in nursing homes and to believe that they are somehow incapable of deciding, or are disinterested in, their own welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's aged care program is designed to allow nursing homes and residents as much flexibility and freedom of choice as possible. It is also designed to allow residents to enjoy a life that is as close as possible to their previous life outside the nursing home. I point out to the House an example in my electorate&mdash;I am sure that other members would have similar examples in their electorates&mdash;of an Italian nursing home called Villa Terenzio where almost all of the residents in the hostel or the hospital speak Italian and many of the staff also speak Italian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family visiting arrangements and the open days at that nursing home and hostel are wonderful to see. These people take great care of their relatives and constantly attend the hostel and the nursing home to make sure that the feeling that the residents have of the nursing home is as close as possible to the feeling they have for their own home. That is a very good thing for people who are old and who do not want to be treated as though they no longer matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current leave arrangements for nursing homes allow residents to go on leave from the nursing home to receive treatment in hospital or for personal and social reasons. That is an improvement which the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has overseen in recent years. Residents are able to take this leave to return to their families for special occasions or even just to have a break away from the nursing home. While residents are on leave, the Government continues to subsidise the nursing home for their beds, which must be available when they return. This is a sensible arrangement that was not always available. That meant that frequently people were afraid to go out of the nursing home&mdash;even for serious problems that required hospitalisation&mdash;because they feared that their bed would not be available when they returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1990 the Government introduced unlimited hospital leave for both nursing home and hostel residents. This is in addition to an entitlement of 28 days each year for social leave. This latest government initiative to allow residents two days of preadmission leave represents a further enhancement of the leave arrangements for aged people in residential care. I believe this Bill, whilst being an omnibus Bill containing a lot of other aspects of legislation, covers some very important territory in the areas of nursing homes and aged care, and I commend it to the House, without amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleagues have already pointed out, the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill makes a number of changes to a range of Acts which fall within the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio. Because of the large scope of the Bill and the limited time available in which to discuss it, I intend to confine my comments to those provisions relating to the Disability Services Act and the First Home Owners Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read the proposed amendments to the Disabilities Services Act 1986 my thoughts automatically reflected on a group of parents within my electorate who have been in constant contact with me over the past three years. The parents, all of whom have children with intellectual disabilities, came to see me initially not because they objected to the Act itself, but because they were frightened by the big brother attitude of the Government, an attitude which I might add appears to be at the point of forcing the closure of sheltered workshops Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parents argued that unrealistic guidelines were being rigidly enforced without proper consultation or consideration of how difficult it would be for sheltered workshops to comply. These guidelines had not been asked for by those with intellectual disabilities or their parents or their service providers. Indeed, the vast majority of those who were directly involved in community services had neither volunteered nor been asked for their views. While the parents felt that their objections would probably make no difference to a government that could not be bothered to ask and rarely ever listened, they resolved to give it a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it transpired, my constituents were not the only ones prepared to stand up and be counted. The parents in my electorate were joined by hundreds more from all over Australia, and a powerful lobby group was eventually formed. There is no doubt in my mind that the amendments before us are as a result of the actions of this group. Changes to the disability services require time, patience and an open-minded approach in order to succeed. Clearly, any plan to integrate disabled people into society, where they compete for jobs on the open market, cannot under the present economic climate succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With close on one million people unemployed, jobs are scarce and competition is fierce. Employers can pick and choose from a bottomless pit of applicants. Only the best qualified can hope to win. Did this Government seriously intend to force our intellectually disabled, who are totally unprepared for such a change, to compete in such a climate?  Did the Labor Party's ideals, which seek to control every aspect of our lives, override commonsense and social conscience?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments go part of the way towards the apology due to this particular section of our society. They represent a clear backdown by this Government, an admission that its high-handed attitude has backfired. I note that this Government has also yielded to Opposition pressure for amendments in a number of other areas. In particular, it has yielded to our calls for an appeals procedure, for full consultation with service providers and receivers and for more flexibility in its guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing firstly with the provisions of an intermediate level of service standard and attainment, the establishment of so-called transitional services, I would be interested in learning how many funded services will actually meet the guidelines set down by the Government by June of 1992. I suspect it will be very few indeed because, realistically, as the Government was warned repeatedly, the guidelines were too rigid to be attainable. In spite of this, I welcome the amendments which will give valuable breathing space to sheltered workshops, which feared their funding would be cut at the end of June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the Government's intention to incorporate an appeals procedure, I hope that the proposed disability standards review panel comprises a balanced cross-section of service providers and receivers. Similarly, we must be sure that everyone concerned with this section of society is given the opportunity to have a say in the future moulding of services for the disabled. This is not only a courtesy; it is also a necessity if our disabled are to be provided with the best possible lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a world of difference between government assistance and government interference. There are a number of first-class sheltered workshops operating throughout Australia which would undoubtedly benefit from assistance. Instead, they are struggling to cope with interference. It is the Opposition's view that efficient services which provide the best practicable lifestyle for particular people should be left in place. Most importantly of all, we must be absolutely certain that these amendments are not designed to create a false sense of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister retains the power to determine clear and objective standards. In other words, he can, to a large extent, still pull the strings. I would therefore like to pass on to the Minister, as a gentle reminder, the views expressed to me by that group of parents three years ago. They told me they never had any concerns with the Disability Services Act as legislation. However, its implementation had amounted to `bureaucracy gone mad'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill deals with a second group of people who also deserve some consideration from the Government: young families, especially those on low incomes who are struggling to buy their own homes. To this extent, part 3 of the Bill makes an amendment to the First Home Owners Act 1983 to provide for the reinstatement of payments to beneficiaries under the first home owners scheme once they have supplied their tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move in to discuss this particular amendment in more detail, it is appropriate that I outline to the House a little of the background of the scheme. The first home owners scheme, known as FHOS, was first introduced by the Hawke Government in 1983. It replaced the three programs put in place by the Fraser Government to encourage home ownership; namely, the home deposit assistance scheme, the special tax rebate for first home owners and the general tax rebate in respect of interest paid on housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collective annual expenditure on the Fraser Government's programs was around $360m compared with the $120m spent by the Government on FHOS during its last full year of operation. Regardless of this, FHOS was successful in the early days in helping young families into their own homes. In 1984-85, for example, the scheme provided funding for around 88,000 young individuals and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a tightening of the eligibility criteria, the Government's consistent refusal to index the eligibility threshold and a reduction in the grant provided, the impact of the program fell off significantly. Indeed, the number of families assisted dropped from 43,000 in 1986-87 to 36,000 in 1988-89 and finally to 25,000 in the year 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The culmination of all of these changes and the dramatic reduction in the numbers assisted was, in the end, the Government's decision to abolish the program on 21 August 1990. In fact, this decision, plus the deliberate high interest rate policy of the late 1980s and the subsequent decline in housing affordability, signalled the end of the Government's commitment to home buyers. Significantly, along with the impact of poor economic policies, it also illustrated its lack of commitment to the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Government has maintained the status quo in regard to housing policy over the last couple of years. This is in spite of the growing power of the Labor Party Left&mdash;its social conscience&mdash;and all of the hand-outs and pork-barrelling contained in the One Nation statement. In fact, from where I stand, the Government's only initiative in the whole housing area has been the creation of the national housing strategy, a hugely expensive bureaucratic extravagance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the coalition which has retained its commitment to Australia's young families and to helping them realise their dream of owning a home. More importantly, we have had the courage to demonstrate our commitment by putting in place tangible measures to assist home buyers. To start with, the coalition will reintroduce the first home owners scheme. Low income families will receive a one-off payment of $2,000 to help with their first home purchase. Home buyers will be given access to their accumulated superannuation funds for use as part or all of the deposit on a home. They will also be able to earn up to $2,000 interest on their savings completely tax free, while their housing affordability&mdash;that is, the buyer's capacity to pay off a home loan&mdash;will be dramatically boosted through massive cuts to income tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill we are debating this evening does not address these issues or any other relating to home ownership in any way, shape or form; nor does it outline the Government's intention to give more young families access to their own homes. What the Bill does do is correct an anomaly created by previous legislation which had the effect of depriving FHOS recipients of their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of the Government's data matching program, FHOS recipients were given 60 days from the date of request to supply their tax file numbers. If the tax file number was not provided within the nominated time, payment of the benefit was cancelled. However, an unintended consequence of the amendment was that benefits could not be reinstated once the tax file number was supplied. This legislation corrects that anomaly by providing for the restoration of benefits. It also brings the treatment of FHOS recipients into line with that of other welfare pension recipients to whom data matching systems apply. As such, this amendment will restore payments to some 500 FHOS recipients who inadvertently or for some other reason did not furnish their tax file numbers within the required 60 days. The Opposition welcomes the restoration of these payments and hence will not oppose this section of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill to talk specifically about community services, although it could be just as accurately said that I could address myself to some of the aged care concerns that came up with the Bill. What I say at the beginning is that I regret the manner in which two Government members have addressed themselves to this Bill, to really put at risk those people who are the most vulnerable within this community&mdash;the disabled. To suggest that the Opposition at any stage has considered using the disabled as political pawns in an argument is quite mischievous, it misrepresents the situation, and I would expect any honourable member who is doing his job in this House to check the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have continually said that the aged and the disabled within the community should not be subject to any political manipulations. If there is one thing in this House we should come together on, it is the interests of the aged and the disabled because they have no other forum to appeal to than the parties that form this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the amendments that we have had placed on the record in the past two or three years, begging the Government's intervention to pick them up and do something with them, were of a political nature is something which I resent most thoroughly. The honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) came in here and made speeches that could have been prepared from within the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services or, if not from within the Department, from the office of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). It reflects poorly on those members that they did not check the facts beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Minister was invited by me nearly two years ago when he first took office to adhere to the principle that the Opposition was not in this for politicking but for the interests of the disabled and that the Government should pick up these amendments and talk about these things in a calm and comfortable fashion. That offer has not been taken up. Why is it that now, two years later, we have rushed into this House a series of amendments&mdash;some of which follow our suggestions&mdash;without any time to debate them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister, the Government and those in the Department consider this to be social justice for those people who are estranged and in most need of care, then I think they ought to redefine social justice. The two members of the Government who have spoken tonight talked of social justice and equity&mdash;a fair return from an inequitable society. They are the people who have denied social justice to these most needy persons within the community. They have denied it in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They talk of the number of people who have been helped through the programs to date. They do not talk about the number of people who have not been helped. Unfortunately, as medicine improves and society's expectations grow, we will have more of these disadvantaged people within the community to look after, yet the program has been administered&mdash;as good as the Act was&mdash;by people who have no reaction and no feeling for what happens out in society; in other words, they are not grassroot operators. They are people who are secure in the Public Service, in a secure job with the Department, but who know nothing or very little about the reaction of people out in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It horrifies me to think that the Minister and the people within the Department who are making these decisions are on record as saying in some cases that they do not know what a sheltered workshop is about; they have never visited one. That is the absolute truth and I can verify that; I would not say it unless it were the truth. During my time as a shadow Minister, I continually went around and saw what happened within the sheltered workshops and the efforts of the volunteers who are doing their best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people within the industry who stand over the providers and authorise the payments and adjudicate the contracts have never had their fingers soiled. In fact, it would not be a bad idea for public servants to have a two-year leave of absence from the security of their jobs so that they can get out into the workplace and find out how the industry works. If they did, they would understand the stress on an industry provider who has been denied a contract or who has been contracted only for 12 months. They are subject to guidelines which are so flexible they change from one moment to another. It is on record that programs have been approved within the period of a month or two months only to be rescinded by the same people who approved them or to be discovered in Canberra that permission was not granted. It was not granted on the basis that the program was not good enough; it was disregarded on the basis that the funds were not available within the Department for that particular allocation of the program because too much was taken up in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take umbrage at the suggestion that the Opposition would defund the programs. How that assumption was made really beats me. We have said in Fightback that the two areas in which there will be unaltered financing are aged care and disability services. We have gone further: we have said that any savings effected within the administration of the Department would be returned to the services, not used in some way to reimburse the Treasury, which is functioning at this moment with a severe deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make those two suggestions&mdash;firstly, that we are playing politics with the aged and, secondly, that we would defund the programs&mdash;is quite mischievous and misrepresents the situation. It is interesting to note that the two honourable members who made those allegations are no longer in the chamber. I believe those two speeches were prepared within the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the Australian people saw disability services for what they are. It is an opportunity for each of us to consider those people who have a disability and to do something about it. It is interesting to note that this Saturday McDonald's is conducting a nationwide fundraising campaign the proceeds of which will go back to disabled children. In that regard, I think it is worthy of the assistance of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that not only have these amendments been on the public record in this House for the last 18 months to two years, but also they have been thoroughly canvassed by people in the field. It is interesting to note that one of the honourable members who spoke tonight&mdash;the honourable member for Lilley&mdash;is on record as having attacked the work of the volunteers from the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table, might indicate whether I am incorrect, but I believe he is also on record as having attacked some of those voluntary organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that we came to realise that these people should not be subject to the politics of the day. They should be given some security, and the amendments we proposed were in that vein. The Act has been in place for five years, and for five years the Government has said that there should not be any changes. Yet for five years we have been waiting for guidelines, the laying down of principles. None have come before the House. This is only because the Minister and his Department have sought to use them as a flexible way of funding some programs and not others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has already said that he would not defund any of the sheltered workshops. That is not true. A sheltered workshop within my area was defunded and could remain in funding only by going to an alternative program under HACC. Yet the organisation which was funded in its place is draining scarce dollars from the other organisation's pocket and also that of another organisation in the same region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time for this Parliament to operate as the auditor of the affairs of the Department. I believe those guidelines should come before this Parliament, not as regulations which have to be approved or disapproved in total, but as guidelines which can be debated to show the people of Australia that we in this Parliament do consider that there has to be some social justice for those people out there&mdash;and social justice includes being able to get a fair deal from the Department and the Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have laid down in the amendments, which we will be debating later on, the need for guidelines to come before this House because we have not had any for five years. I ask the people within the Department: why has it taken five years to set down the guidelines?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been beseeched to not include in those amendments the laying down of the program for sheltered workshops. Do honourable members know why we are doing that? It is because the Government has come to us at this late stage, with no guidelines laid down and without any idea of where it is going, and said, `Trust us; we'll do these things'. As far as the Opposition is concerned, we have given too much trust to the Government in the administration of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by somebody that if he were writing a history of the Disability Services Act of Australia, he would claim that it was the most mismanaged Act of any Act within the Commonwealth. That speaks for itself. Why should we not have the parliamentary purview of it? Why should we not have an appeals mechanism? Why should we not have certain contracts? Only at this late stage have we removed the threat of transition by June 1992. That stress has been playing on many of the clients in Australia, many of the advocates, many of the parents and many of the industries which service this disability area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time I have left I would like to say that I believe the services function only because of some well meaning and well trained volunteers in the field who have changed with the times. They now provide a service in Australia&mdash;not because of the DSA, but because of themselves&mdash;which is superior to anywhere else in the world. It is not a time for us to be bogged down in the pedantics of the Department, making decisions on which it does not follow through. That is why we have proposed our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments are almost a replica of the amendments we laid on the table in this House about three weeks ago just to keep our position on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and to keep faith with the providers and the clients of disability services in Australia. They are complete, except for one matter which has been taken up by the Government in the form of the transition date being extended beyond 1992. We had suggested that the extension be granted in various phases to 1997. The allegation was made in the debate on the second reading that we had done this with a view to turning back the clock for a century as far as disability services are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I readily remember that, when we suggested an extension of the transition date, we did it with the view that there should be a discipline within the Act to maintain the pressure on people to try to bring these clients to a level or standard of service to which they could aspire. We did not suggest at that time that the transition date was there as a protection, a cover or security for those people who did not want to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were quite specific on that, and that is why we chose a date of transition so that the services would still have the pressure on them to raise the quality and standard of the service for the individual client who could aspire to something better. On this occasion the Government has said that it will remove the transition date and impose as a form of discipline a monitoring of the outcomes, yet we have not seen specific guidelines for these outcomes. However, if the Government chooses to remove the transition date, the Opposition finds nothing wrong with that. I just wanted to stress yet again that we were not letting the service providers off the hook completely; we want them to be able to assimilate that action over a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of these amendments is specifically to formulate guidelines. Right at the commencement, the Minister was to formulate guidelines and set out the principles and the ambitions that he and the Department had for disability services. As I have said, we have seen an abuse of that principle, because the guidelines have been so flexible that they have changed from one month to another and approvals have changed from one person to another.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill, incorporating a number of changes to tariff rates, many of which have been introduced by customs tariff proposals. It includes the imposition of a proposed $12,000 per vehicle tariff on second-hand car imports. Because the Government cannot manage its own legislative program, just as it has not managed to run the country over the last few years, I will not have time tonight to debate many of the changes proposed by this Bill, particularly as one amendment proposed by the Government represents a major shift in policy. That change&mdash;the proposed $12,000 additional tariff on imported used cars&mdash;deserves a full debate by itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before moving on to that part of the Bill, however, I will quickly skip through the coalition's position on some of the amendments. We support the full extension of the automotive export facilitation scheme to component producers so that they can use export credits directly. The coalition, I might say, is not a member of the facilitation cheer squad, exactly. In fact, it is my view that, whilst encouraging exports, the scheme is also equally encouraging imports and that some Australian part manufacturers will disappear as a result of the scheme. But we consider that, as it is in place, it should be allowed to continue and wind down in tandem with the tariff cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the proposal to allow state-of-the-art capital equipment to enter Australia duty free is welcome&mdash;and a welcome recognition of the costs imposed on producers by the tariff system. The same principle is apparent in amendments which allow all aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair and the maintenance of the same to be imported duty free. In addition, there is duty free entry of certain chemicals and textile fabric for use in chemicals, plastics and bookbinding industries, and that will assist these sectors to become internationally competitive.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tariff on a number of steel products will be reduced from 10 to 5 per cent to ensure that Australian producers have access to competitively priced steel in the wake of BHP's takeover of New Zealand Steel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes, if nothing else, demonstrate how greatly the edifice of protection has hindered rather than helped many of our industries to become world competitive, and demonstrate precisely why we must continue to phase down all tariffs and other protective structures for all industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of the principal Act is amended to redefine off-road and passenger vehicles. The new criteria are supposed to be more straightforward, but they will mean that more vehicles attract higher duty rates of 35 per cent. The coalition requests that these changes be monitored to ensure that genuine commercial vehicles are not subject to the passenger motor vehicle rate of duty. A number of other changes in the Bill are essentially housekeeping: the insertion of tender quota rates for duty for TCF goods for the final year of quotas, the lifting of the so-called footwear price line, and an amendment to ensure that the same duty is paid on the so-called short pack bicycles as complete bicycles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the tragic situation in Yugoslavia, changes have also been made to the developing country schedules, not without some problems, which I understand the Government intends to rectify in another place. The coalition has circulated an amendment which makes it absolutely clear that the former Yugoslavian republic known as Macedonia has not been recognised as an independent state of that name. My colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) will elaborate on this part of the Bill in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come to the proposed additional $12,000 per vehicle tariff on second-hand motor vehicles. The coalition regards this part of the Bill very seriously; the Government clearly does not, giving me realistically not more than five minutes or so to debate this Bill, or this part of it at least. This decision seemed simply to come out of the blue last December. There was no consultation with anybody as far as we can gather. No information was provided so that we and other people could make a proper judgment&mdash;absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the car buying public&mdash;or not so car buying public these days because cars are expensive and the public are broke&mdash;are presumably meant to meekly and mutely accept this new arrangement. On the basis of such contemptuous treatment alone, the measure should be opposed. But the coalition has spent a lot of time since the announcement trying to ascertain some facts on which to make a response. All we found was that nobody in government or the industry has done the work to find out whether such a measure should be introduced. We believe, therefore, that the Government should agree to hold a full Industry Commission inquiry to look at all aspects of the issue before any action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, that this is what the Government is required to do under its own legislation&mdash;the Industry Commission Act, section 10, subsection (1). We all know that this subsection does not render tariff changes illegal, but certainly the imposition of a $12,000 tariff flouts the spirit of the law which was intended to ensure that decisions were based on the facts and that people had an opportunity to put their view. Senator Button is apparently unmoved. He is on record as saying that he would increase the $12,000 tariff if it proved inadequate to stop these imports. That is all very macho of him, but it does not make for cool decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking for no more than is required by the Government's own law. There are a number of matters that need to be clarified on this issue before anybody can make a sensible decision on the matter. First, whether car registration and arrangements for road worthiness in Japan accelerate the depreciation of older vehicles, thus depressing their resale value, and the extent perhaps of any effective subsidy involved to the Japanese car producers; second, the potential impact of second-hand imports on the Australian automotive industry most certainly needs to be looked at; third, the potential impact on car prices, car safety and car emissions; fourth, the impact on Australian consumers; fifth, whether imported used cars under the current arrangements meet all the design, safety and consumer requirements imposed on local producers and dealers; sixth, whether the import of used cars from Japan creates value-adding jobs in Australia; and, finally, whether the import of used cars from Japan is likely to replace new cars from Australia or, perhaps more likely, old cars from Australia or even new cars from Japan. Who knows the answers to these questions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most certainly the Government does not know. Most certainly the Department did not know in the Senate Estimates hearings on this subject. Our senators asked questions of the Department, and gave the Department ample opportunity to provide information at those hearings last month. Quite frankly, the replies from the Minister's Department were quite pathetic. I will read from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 April. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SENATOR BISHOP&mdash;. . . you have done a study of what happened across the Tasman in New Zealand. I wonder whether you could tell me when that work was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bell&mdash;My comments were really just intended to help the Committee. There was no study done . . . I was simply informing the Committee of the situation of which we are aware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SENATOR BISHOP&mdash;Dr Bell, you said, `We found when we looked across the Tasman'. If you found it, presumably you did a study. Did you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bell&mdash;No, you just have to look, Senator. You do not have to do a study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SENATOR BISHOP&mdash;. . . What I would like you to go and find out for me, Dr Bell . . . is who compiled a report which may or may not have contained information from the Department of Commerce in New Zealand. Was it a result of an inquiry from DITAC?  What date did this occur and what was done with the information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bell&mdash;Nobody made a visit. There was no report. We have a file with some information on it that has come in from various sources, including the Department of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA>The written responses to questions taken on notice are even more revealing. Amongst other things they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no detailed analysis of the relative impact on balance of payments, employment or value-adding of importing a new Mazda compared to imposing a second-hand Mazda . . . Given that the actual level of all future imports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of second-hand cars&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could not be identified precisely, a detailed cost benefit analysis could not be undertaken .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered that, on the strength of information available&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>what little there was&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to it there was sufficient reason to know before an unmanageable problem arose.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the decision was made on a large polyglot of statistical vapour, a factual vacuum: plenty of emotion and no facts. Whilst we are on the subject of facts, I might say that the accuracy of the facts that we have been presented with from the automotive industry sadly, I have to say, leave much to be desired. The only documentary evidence available has been supplied by the importer, Taiyo Corporation, which shows an FOB value ex Japan for Mazda Capellas of around $2,200, freight of $1,000, duty and sales tax of $1,300 and modification costs to comply with ADRs in this country of around $3,000, a total of some $7,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there has been shaky reasoning, but that is not the only problem. There is no reason blindly to assume that what has happened in New Zealand would happen here. We have a completely different range of Australian design rule compliance procedures which are not imposed in New Zealand. I am concerned that the Department itself may be releasing misleading information about the number of used cars currently entering Australia, and I would ask the Minister to provide details to the House of the numbers of high volume used cars that are coming in. I would also ask him to explain the definitions of high volume and low volume. There is no definition in the Bill and there seem to be a few variations floating around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question mark about the timing of the $12,000 tariff announcement. Apparently the day that the Taiyo Corporation complied with all of the things that were requested of it was the day on which this announcement was made. We want to know the facts. We really want to know as well, as I mentioned before, whether any of the arrangements in Japan effectively subsidised its exports of new and/or old cars into this country. It might be useful to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to know whether such imports might reduce the age of the Australian car park, where the average age of the private fleet is currently running at 17 years. Surely this information is absolutely essential. I therefore urge the Minister to withdraw the relevant amendments in this Bill and agree to a full inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the coalition will not oppose this Bill. But if the Government does not agree to an inquiry into the second-hand car issue, I will be moving an amendment&mdash;that is, if we can have a committee stage&mdash;to delete all reference to the additional $12,000 per vehicle tariff. </PARA>

Schedule 1 is operative from 1 July 1990 and subtracts the customs duty component from the New Zealand rate of duty for tobacco products of chapter 24&mdash;an amendment to that part. The amendment is made in the context of Australia's obligations under the 1988 closer economic relations protocol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedules 2, 3 and 4 contain amendments to concessional items in schedule 4 of the principal Act. In particular, schedule 2, which will operate from 1 January 1991, amends item 41A. This will allow motor vehicle component manufacturers to directly use import credits which they earn under the motor vehicle export facilitation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 will have effect from 12 March 1991. Item 56 will allow certain capital equipment which is technologically more advanced, efficient or productive than equipment available from Australian manufacture to be imported duty free. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) said, that certainly makes sense; it is a very good move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 will take effect from 1 October 1991. The provisions of item 31 have been expanded to allow all aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft to be imported duty free. The only exceptions are goods which are used for servicing aircraft. Again, this affirms our objective to develop and maintain an international competitiveness for Australia's aerospace manufacturing and aviation industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sunset clause has also been removed from item 36B, which allows certain chemicals to be imported duty free for specific end users. Item 57 has been created to allow certain chemicals and textile fabric to be imported duty free when used in the chemicals, plastics, bookbinding and allied industries. This action will also assist the international competitiveness of these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly item 57 is important to me. I have a very successful company in my electorate in Bundaberg known as the Bundaberg Bag Co., which is doing extremely well. This item will allow it to be more competitive in using some of these products and to value add and sell the finished product not only to the Australian market but also to the expanding Asian market. Indeed, I was very pleased to discuss with the management of the company only recently the output and the way in which the company is going economically. I am pleased to say that, in 14 years of operation, the last quarter is the best quarter that it has ever had, and that will make a great contribution to management's understanding of and cooperation with all its employees from management down and the progressive and loyal way in which it puts Australian industry and, particularly, Bundaberg first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to schedule 3 of the principal Act involve the treatment of motor vehicles. The definitions of off-road and passenger motor vehicles in additional notes 4 and 5 to chapter 87 have been amended. Item 57 in schedule 4 has been altered, expanding the range of raw materials and intermediate goods available as duty free imports for the chemicals, plastics, bookbinding and allied industries. As I said, this creates a more competitive market for our manufacturers and producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 8 will operate from 1 July 1992. It concerns the duty on cold-rolled and clad, plated or coated and flat-rolled steel products of tariff headings 7209, 7210, 7211 and 7212. They will be reduced from 10 to 5 per cent. For specified products this represents an acceleration of the phasing down of general tariffs announced in the 1991 industry statement. The tariff rates for goods from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan province will be maintained at 5 per cent in line with measures also announced in the industry statement. We all recognise that these Asian tigers certainly do not need the preference they had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one controversial aspect in regard to both our side of the House and the Opposition side. That is in regard to the imposition of a duty of $12,000 per vehicle in addition to the duty already in place in relation to high volume imports of used or second-hand passenger motor vehicles. There is a concern&mdash;I know that the previous speaker touched on it, but not with the same point of view&mdash;which I certainly share, about the high volume of imports of motor vehicles from Japan through the importer Taiyo Corporation. In my view, and in the Government's view, that would flood the Australian market and cause massive dislocation of the Australian motor vehicle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think people in Japan would be able to quibble, given the high tariffs they have in industries such as the rice industry. I think that, by putting the Australian motor vehicle industry first, we have done the right thing. I know from speaking to the dealers in my area that they are very supportive of that fact. They have indicated to me that it is the best thing we have ever done for the motor vehicle industry. I will conclude now because of the time limitations and because there are other members who wish to speak on this Bill. I am hopeful that the Opposition will support these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My purpose was originally to speak against the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, inasmuch as it would have granted de facto recognition by Australia of the former so-called Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. I am extremely pleased that, following my letter to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), the Minister has seen the error of his ways and decided to amend his own amendments. In sum, although it may be embarrassing for him, the Minister has had to make arrangements to ensure that Australia does not grant recognition to a former Yugoslav republic such as Macedonia in an underhanded and unjust way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The said amendments would have had Australia, for the purposes of its customs procedures, incorrectly treat so-called Macedonia as an official political entity. It would have bestowed upon the former republic centred on Skopje the same status as that enjoyed by other former Yugoslav republics, such as Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Essentially, these amendments sought to pre-empt any officially completed diplomatic procedure and/or Government decision to grant recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House knows well that, largely on a bipartisan basis, Australia grants recognition only after both a careful analysis of a given country's fulfilment of the internationally accepted criteria and a thorough assessment of our own national interests. To the great disappointment of many, this norm was completely deviated from by the content of these customs amendments, which took it on themselves to grant recognition by virtue of bureaucratic fine print rather than established practice and public debate. Clearly, these amendments were procedurally wrong. They were also in direct contravention of the public policies of both the Government and the Opposition&mdash;policies determined to protect Australia's national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps unbeknown to the Minister at the time, both the Government and the Opposition have outlined the parameters for the recognition of the former Yugoslav republic in question. Firstly, the name issue must be resolved by the Skopje leadership. The usage of the term `Macedonia' by it creates tension in the region and does not bode well for the neighbourly cooperation its young state would need. Secondly, Greece's real concerns about future territorial claims on its northern province must be resolved by Skopje. Thirdly, Skopje must satisfy the international community on the question of protection of ethnic minorities such as the Albanians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own perspective, I believe that there is an overwhelming historical case to be made against Skopje's use of the name Macedonia and overwhelming foreign policy arguments in favour of standing by our long-time ally Greece, with which we have such strong political and cultural ties. As I have said before and will continue to shout from the mountain tops, Macedonia was Greek, is Greek, and should remain Greek. I am grateful that I have been able to play a small role to ensure it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for me, however, to surmise why the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs would have tried to slip in this de facto recognition of an entity called Macedonia against both the tide of established practice and our policy approach. I do not know whether the Minister was poorly briefed, too busy to read his own legislation or just plain incompetent; or whether he did not read the fine print of the amendments prepared for him by the Government bureaucrats and inadvertently let the recognition of `Macedonia' slip past, or did not bother to check with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) as to his own Government's position on the question of the recognition of the former Yugoslav socialist republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to me today the Minister claims that Macedonia is added in this legislation under the section dealing with places, not independent countries. Sadly for his argument, however, the three other additions as so-called places rather than independent countries are Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, all three of which have been recognised by Australia as independent countries. Why put Macedonia in this group unless it is an attempt to subvert the process and admit recognition of Macedonia by backdoor means? Or does this nonsense mean that the true Macedonia&mdash;the northern province of Greece&mdash;should be treated as an independent developing country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the reason, the fact that these amendments came before this House and are to be corrected only at the eleventh hour remains unchanged and is unpardonable. It is an example of truly bad law making. The Minister is responsible for nearly sneaking by us all a foreign policy blunder. He may well have committed our Government to major embarrassment overseas and perhaps even worse consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the proposed changes, the Government only suffers the deserved disdain of all Australians. The Minister should be brought to account for what has nearly happened and nearly tragically transpired in this House. I call on him to immediately and publicly state how these amendments came to be in the first place and why they were allowed by him to proceed so far down the track. If he tries to put the blame on his public servants he must answer why he is being run by the bureaucrats rather than doing his job and running them. Contrary to what his Government would like to think, he cannot fool all the people all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, because of time constraints imposed by this Labor Government, I cannot go into this matter more deeply at present, but I will certainly take the opportunity to do so on a later occasion. I wholeheartedly support the coalition's amendments which are to be moved in the committee stage, the first of which will omit the word `Macedonia' and substitute the words `the former Yugoslavian republic known as Macedonia'. This amendment, together with two other amendments to be moved by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), have my wholehearted and complete support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been mentioned, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992 is designed to cover a number of issues, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers. First, I wish to refer to the amendment under schedule 7, operative from 1 April 1992, which amends the definition of an off-road vehicle. This is an attempt by the Government to be more specific, considering how many vehicles of ordinary passenger style are four-wheel drive. Considering the additional safety that these sorts of vehicles provide, it seems a pity that they will be taxed at higher rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point that strikes me is that the Government is still grappling with the definition of a four-wheel drive for duty purposes. It still grapples with it for sales tax purposes. I guess any of us who have any remote association with fishing communities in particular know that there has been a constant outrage from fishermen that they are denied the right to sales tax exemption on four-wheel drive vehicles while those on farming properties, which I also represent, have had that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in stark contrast with the circumstances that will apply when the coalition is in government and its Fightback policy applies. It will not matter then&mdash;be they fishermen, small businessmen, farmers or anybody else who is a registered GST taxpayer&mdash;because they will pay no wholesale sales tax on these sorts of vehicles since it will not apply. By the year 2000 they will pay no customs duty on these vehicles&mdash;this legislation is still struggling with that&mdash;and they will pay no GST because they will be able to deduct it from their collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress the word `collections'. When addressing the responsibilities of the business community under the GST there is too much talk about what they will pay. They will pay nothing. They will collect taxation in the course of their business and they will deduct from that any amounts that they have paid. As there would normally be a surplus, they will send the balance to the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, whilst the Government still struggles with a new definition of a four-wheel drive, it is certainly not the first for Customs purposes. They will not be problems under the proposals that will be put forward by the coalition when it is in government. I am sure that will be of considerable interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to schedule 8, operative from 1 July 1992, which phases down tariffs on certain vegetables, including potatoes. There is no opposition to this proposal from this side of the House. I am reminded&mdash;and I think it is worth putting on the record&mdash;that we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at Question Time today screaming off again the list of the various achievements of his Government from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he overlooked the fact that these proposals were frequently opposed by the Australian Democrats and supported by the Opposition. In other words, we gave him the opportunity to achieve reform in this country in areas that we thought were appropriate and proper&mdash;something which, from my recollection of the period that I sat in this House in government, he never afforded us once. The question was never the national good; the question was always: how much can I screw out of this politically? It was interesting to note, in terms of excise and customs duty, his original reaction when certain additional taxes on fuel were opposed. He accused us of making every bowser a tax collector and later refused to lower excise when there was a substantial drop in the international price of fuel to which a certain number of those excises were paralleled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the Opposition parties will give support whenever it is appropriate to measures of this nature. I have within my electorate a number of potato growers and a processing works called Southern Processes&mdash;it is just outside my electorate&mdash;which services potato and pea growers. They come to me constantly complaining about the level of import competition they are now receiving from New Zealand. It is not a matter of considerable concern because I would imagine that under the CER arrangements these tariffs in their reduced form would not apply to the trade that we have with New Zealand under CER. However, it is worthy of note that those people complain to me that they are having severe competition from the New Zealanders because their waterfront is more efficient and their currency is of a lower value. They are, in fact, more efficient producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is interesting because we hear from day-to-day in this place what a dreadful place New Zealand is. We hear that the New Zealand work force is being ground into the ground. Yet New Zealand's Statistician has just announced that real wages have grown by 1.3 per cent. This is how tough things are for the New Zealand work force under the new arrangements: it is getting real increases in wages, confirmed by its own Statistician. We also read recently that the New Zealanders have just achieved their first trade surplus for 20 years. It was only $80m but, when one compares that with a typical Australian trade deficit of $700m, $800m, $1,000m and $1,200m, it appears that they are doing something right over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) referred to the Government's attempts to impose a duty on the import of second-hand cars. In fact, it had nothing to do with imposing a duty on the import of second-hand cars; it was just a crude mechanism to determine that it did not happen. I have had representations on this matter over a couple of years and on every occasion the people concerned seemed very determined to do things properly. They have never argued that they should not have to meet Australian design rules. They were treated very flexibly originally and the Government obviously thought that it could keep to its principle of low tariffs. I think that at that stage the Prime Minister was arguing for the abolition of tariffs altogether. That is my recollection of what he said on the John Laws radio show. That was one of his principal platforms. The Government clearly did not want the embarrassment of being found, at a time when its rhetoric was all built around minimal or no tariffs, to be applying a tariff to second-hand cars, so it threw the Australian design rules book at these importers and the net result was that most of them gave up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of this group, some of whom reside in Western Australia, did the right thing. They are people I have known, the Moores. In fact, I remember them when they were involved in the whaling industry in Carnarvon. They had the testing and everything done. They were able to prove that at least one of these vehicles could be imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another interesting aspect of this. They were basically offering a low cost, low mileage, relatively young, second-hand vehicle at a very reasonable price. I would have thought that the people most interested in such a vehicle would be those on salaries substantially below average weekly earnings&mdash;those people who traipse off every morning to those sorts of jobs and regularly vote Labor when the elections come around. I would have thought that if any government was interested in this particular proposal&mdash;considering its constituency and its needs to get reasonably priced transport&mdash;it would have been the present Labor Government. I would have thought that it genuinely wanted people to be able to purchase cars at a reasonable price. Here is a once in a lifetime opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my observations, because of the very nature of Japan and the concentration of vehicles, cars spend more time on idle than at speed. That is what makes them very low mileage and very under-utilised cars. They should be able to be imported to Australia. This Government, having attempted to avoid this situation of imposing a tariff, was confronted by people who met its other requirements. It has now turned around and will impose a flat $12,000 duty on each of these cars&mdash;it does not matter what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker has quite properly raised concerns about this. We want to know what real effect it might have on the industry and a few other things in this regard. It is quite improper to bring this proposal to the Parliament without some consideration. Most importantly, it is quite improper for the people of Wills and the people of the Deputy Speaker's electorate to tell them that this opportunity will be denied them, as will cheap petrol. Those opposite do not give an unemployed fellow the opportunity of a cheap motor car and cheap fuel so that he might be able to drive a bit further to look for a job that they have destroyed. The Government does not want to do that; we do, we want to give those people a go. Many of the proposals that we have in our policies will help them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not accept that the Government will deny people this sort of vehicle at that price unless it produces the evidence. The honourable member for Barker was quite correct in demanding that this matter be withdrawn until the Parliament is properly informed of what is going on or whether it is just another call from Bill Kelty or the President of the Vehicle Builders Union saying, `Fix it. Jump&mdash;and as high as I tell you'. That is the situation. As there is an agreement for some time to be allowed for discussion in committee, I conclude my remarks at this time. </PARA>

I clarify the fact that when this proposal was first introduced as from 1 January neither Croatia nor Slovenia was recognised as a country by Australia; they were recognised on 1 March 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two amendments really come together and concern the omission of the $12,000 punitive tariff to which we have referred a few times in this debate. It really is quite unconscionable that such a tariff be put on cars. There is absolutely no doubt that it is supposed to be a preventative tariff and that no studies or work have been done on this matter. I have set out a number of points that I hope the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) will take into account. Not the least of these is whether, in doing some of the work in bringing these cars into Australia, the value adding would provide work for Australians; and whether it would mean the removal of old cars from the bottom end&mdash;the older end&mdash;of the car park, as it is referred to, where cars are 17 years old in the private fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw a number of other matters to the Minister's attention, not the least of which is that it is patently obvious that the Government has done no work on this matter. It is simply a knee-jerk reaction. As was pointed out in this debate by a Government speaker not long ago, there have been lots of representations made, of course, by the car industry. However, I might point out that the Automobile Association of Australia, representing 5 1/2 million car drivers, opposes this $12,000 tariff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill implement changes to the tariff concession system, broadly as recommended by the Industry Commission, and also implement changes to anti-dumping and countervailing procedures announced by the Government last December. Overall, the Bill represents an improvement in both these areas, but in the anti-dumping and countervailing areas, in particular, the Government has a long, long way to go to ensure that adequate remedies are available to Australian producers against unfair trading practices. I will come to that part of the Bill later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the Bill is concerned with the tariff concessions system which allows goods not produced in Australia to be imported free of duty. There have been complaints for many years from local producers that they cannot obtain tariff concession orders to import special equipment duty free because the local manufacturer objects on the ground that he or she could produce the item, or something similar, but seldom manages to produce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes to the TCO system should make for more balanced decisions where a local producer will have to demonstrate in the future a capacity to produce the items in question. Of course, as protection winds down, the use of the TCOs will also decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, this Bill firstly introduces a new definition of substitutability between goods, replacing the current goods serving similar functions test. Secondly, it provides that where no substitutable goods are produced in Australia in the ordinary course of business, or are produced in the ordinary course of business but the granting of the TCO is not likely to have an adverse impact on the market for these goods, a tariff concession order may be granted. These changes weaken the current tests, thus making it easier to obtain a TCO. Thirdly, the ordinary course of business test is also expanded to ensure that local producers must do more than merely claim they could produce the items in question. For example, they will now need to show that the items have been produced at least two years before the application was lodged or that they have been produced and held in stock and that they are prepared to accept such an order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processing time limit of 150 days is introduced. New limited and definitive grounds for the revocation of TCOs are introduced to address concern amongst users of tariff concessions about possible arbitrary revocation. Applications must be lodged by producers who claim to be producers of substitutable goods. The Industry Commission actually recommended the removal of the revocation option and the proposed changes represent a compromise position. The Comptroller is given greater powers to investigate applications for TCOs and applications for revocation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, new internal review mechanisms are established and the so-called merits review process is two-tiered involving, firstly, internal review and, secondly, review by the AAT. These changes, as I mentioned earlier, should make for fairer decisions under the tariff concession system and I sincerely hope they will at least help producers importing specialist capital equipment and parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the Bill implements changes to anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements announced by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) last December. As far as they go, the changes mostly improve the current arrangements, but they do not go anywhere near far enough. Briefly, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act is amended to allow reviews of measures in place to determine whether the measures should be extended. At least eight months before the new five-year time limit is reached the ADA must publicly announce the forthcoming expiry date and invite interested parties to apply for continuation of the measure within 60 days. The ADA then has 120 days to make a recommendation to the Minister. This measure was proposed by the coalition more than a year ago and its eventual adoption by the Government is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life of the ADA is extended until 2001. As well, the Minister, rather than the Comptroller, will now have power to decide whether a processed agricultural food is related closely enough to the raw agricultural goods so as to give the agricultural producer good standing to bring a dumping complaint. Effectively, this change will give the Anti-Dumping Authority the power to review a decision by the Comptroller on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment flows from the changes made last year for all material injuries suffered by producers of raw materials which are being dumped in a processed form to be taken into account. That move was welcomed by the coalition, but it has been brought to our attention by pork producers that it remains virtually impossible for raw material producers to launch a successful complaint without support from processors. I raise this matter with the Minister so that he is aware, as he may well be, of these concerns and I seek his advice as to whether the changes introduced last year are working adequately and effectively and whether that situation could be reviewed. As well, new procedures are introduced dealing with the lodgment of anti-dumping and countervailing complaints to speed up inquiry times. For example, applications may be faxed. That is a productivity increase which I am sure the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will report to the House tomorrow. We could surely do a little better than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get to the point about the maximum time period for the processing of claims to the prima facie stage. I notice that the Government is reducing the time from 35 to 25 days. I believe this represents a negligible improvement at best, and it is not good enough. I will be moving an amendment later to bring the prima facie inquiry period into line with the coalition policy&mdash;that is, five days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, Customs is now permitted to use information not contained in the application to determine whether a prima facie case exists. Presumably, this will help to speed up inquiries. However, we are concerned to see that there is a facility for applicants to be advised of just what this other relevant information is. Applications received by the Customs Service must be presented in a way which facilitates rapid processing. This will be achieved via up-front assistance through the customs business liaison units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period of time for which a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice or an undertaking remains in force is extended from three years to five years&mdash;again, in line with longstanding coalition policy. I am glad to see that the Government has taken up this suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act is amended to facilitate findings and remedies in cases where both dumping and subsidisation exist and which jointly are causing material injury. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992 implements complementary amendments to effect this particular change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year and again in January this year the coalition set out a new anti-dumping and countervailing system. Amongst other things, that system will significantly reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping and countervailing cases. Five working days will be allotted to determine whether or not a complaint meets formal requirements&mdash;whether or not there is a case to answer. If it does, a preliminary investigation of up to 60 days, with provision for up to 30 days extension in special circumstances, will ensue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the preliminary investigation, provisional measures will be imposed or undertakings can be accepted if dumping or subsidisation is found. This finding will be either confirmed or rejected in a final investigation of up to 90 days. These changes will ensure a maximum total investigation period of 155 days and 185 days in exceptional circumstances, compared with the current 255 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we would make the Australian Customs Service responsible for determining whether or not dumping or subsidisation is occurring, whilst the Anti-Dumping Authority would be responsible for determining the extent of material injury. The Customs Service will be responsible for establishing a causal link between the two. These investigations will be conducted concurrently within the proposed investigation time limits, which of course facilitates the closing of these times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we would help to ensure that the proposed time limits are achieved by implementing procedures to allow exchange of confidential information between representatives of the principal parties&mdash;a circumstance which obtains in some parts of the legal system at this time. Fourthly, we would extend the existing three-year sunset period for anti-dumping and countervailing measures to five years, with reviews to be held before the expiry of such measures&mdash;a measure which, as I have just said, has now been adopted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, we would ensure that material injury tests do not require virtual decimation of the local industry before remedial action is considered necessary&mdash;which I have to say, under the Government's arrangements to date, has been the case for some time. Sixthly, we would provide adequate human and capital resources to the Australian Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority to facilitate speedy and fully informed determinations. As well, we would simplify the informational requirements imposed upon local complainants, whilst bearing in mind the need to deter vexatious and frivolous complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is committed to implementing this policy when in government and urges the current Government to do Australian industry a favour and steal all of our policies in full. To assist in this regard, I have circulated a second reading amendment outlining what the Government should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the Government's history on anti-dumping and countervailing policy is not one that it should be proud of. It has chopped and changed and it is slowly but surely being dragged to foreshorten these procedures so that those complainants have a chance not only to get up an appropriate anti-dumping or countervailing measure but to do so without running out of financial resources beforehand, which is one of the problems that people have when these things take too long, as they do at the present time. The Opposition is offering the Government an opportunity to get it right once and for all. I urge the Government to agree to this amendment which has been circulated in my name. I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill is an omnibus measure and proposes a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 and the Customs Tariff Miscellaneous Amendments Act 1987. At the outset I wish to make a couple of very relevant points. Firstly, we are very fortunate that we have an outstanding Customs Service in this country and it should be given full credit. The other point that should be made is that we have one of the fastest and best anti-dumping systems in the world. That goes without saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that tonight the Opposition moved an amendment which basically appeals to the National Party which is running away and running scared on zero tariffs. The National Party has been peddling in its own areas the protectionist attitude that has been prevailing upon it for the last hundred years. The McEwenism is still there; the monkey is still on their backs in the bush. This is an attempt to try to placate the League of Rights, the voodoo economists and the tunnel vision backwards regulators who reside particularly in the electorate of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss)&mdash;from where the biggest load of rubbish has come out about the dumping of peanuts and food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the honourable member for Wide Bay to set the record straight with clowns like John Cameron, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS>, who has not printed the truth and who would be responsible for the loss of billions of dollars of exports of Australian farm products if his ignorant attitude were instituted. I suggest to those clowns in the National Party in the honourable member's electorate that they tell people the full facts and the truth. The biggest problem we have is getting the message back out to the farmers. There is a challenge on the honourable member for Wide Bay to get the facts out. I am not for one moment saying that he does not tell the truth, but I am saying that he has an obligation to get the message across, because the League of Rights is running a very strong campaign in the South Burnett area and has been getting away with nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jeremy Lee is the classic example. The interesting thing is that he does not want the GST either. I find it strange that on one occasion I am in agreement with the League of Rights&mdash;the only one ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few points need to be made about these amendments. First of all, the attempt to bring the prima facie hearing down to five days from the 25 days that we introduced and, secondly, the proposed reduction to 60 days to reach a preliminary finding. We have put 100 days in the legislation. But I point out at the outset that Australia has a total of 245 days for a final conclusion at the end of the Anti-Dumping Authority's hearings, Canada has 261 days, the United States 280 days and the EC 390 days. Those are the facts. I ask the honourable member for Wide Bay to tell characters like John Cameron that fact. He might print in his paper what the honourable member says, but he will not print what I say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition's amendment an increased burden would be placed on Australian industry and interested parties to raise the quality and timeliness of applications and submissions. It is like telling the police force it has two days to arrest a bank robber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs experience to date has been that this is unlikely to be achieved. Insufficient time to properly weigh argument is likely to result in frequent rejection of applications because they lack sufficient evidence to justify initiation of inquiries. Can one imagine telling Elliot Ness back in the 1930s that he had a week to catch Al Capone? No consideration has been given in the 60-day proposal, either, for the special circumstance surrounding allegations of subsidisation. These consultations are effectively denied and the proposal would therefore seem to be in contravention of the GATT. That is again something that the National Party does not understand&mdash;the general agreement on tariffs and trade. It has been very difficult for us, with our hands tied behind our backs for a long time in this country, fighting overseas while the National Party is ratting and running away and still hiding behind the walls of protection, particularly the Queensland branch of the National Party, which is still supporting protection even today in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current 25 days available for this are critical. That is why the period needs to stay at 25 days. At day 60 under the Opposition's proposal, the majority of findings are likely to be negative. Under the GATT rules, interested parties are to be given at least 30 days to make submissions, as well as another seven days to allow for delivery of documents. This leaves 23 calendar days for Customs to make its preliminary finding. It does not leave sufficient time for Customs to conduct on-site verification of responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience shows that exporter responses are often better prepared, more persuasively argued and more effective in refuting claims made by Australian industry in applications. Customs will therefore be forced to rely on this unverified information to make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of a positive preliminary finding, the GATT codes do not permit the imposition of provisional measures. Options available to Customs are therefore to find negatively or not reach a finding and so allow the second stage to operate. If no finding is made, the Opposition's second stage envisages that it will take a further 90 days from the preliminary finding to final finding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time frame would permit Customs to undertake its on-site inquiries, which were not possible in the previous 60-day period. The Opposition's proposal means that if this finding is positive, and results in the imposition of dumping duties, Australian industry will have had to wait 155 days rather than the present 125 days. So the Opposition's 60-day proposal will not provide assistance to local industry. It will cost it. I think that is the valid point that needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I can only come to the conclusion that the Opposition is proposing this amendment, as I said at the start, to try to placate the National Party, which is terrified of the Liberal Party's scorched earth policy&mdash;terrified. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is chained to the GST&mdash;it is like an albatross around his neck&mdash;and as he goes around Queensland, he gets put under more and more pressure by the Queensland State branch and certainly the New South Wales State branch. So it is obvious that this amendment is put there to try to hold the line. One cannot hold a line on a false premise. Members of the National Party will never accept zero tariffs; they will never accept the scorched earth policies. At the end of the day they are backward regulators, they are agrarian socialists. They are going to break ranks and start to run away, regardless of the sops that are put to them. Certainly, this is not going to help agriculture. At the end of the day they are going to do what they did in 1987. They have a great history for ratting&mdash;that is one thing they do know well&mdash;and they will rat again on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we have a very dedicated team of people in Customs. We should be very proud of them. I am disappointed by the nonsense and rhetoric from people like Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee, who have spread misinformation on trade over the last two years, particularly in the last 12 months. That is un-Australian and it disadvantages Australian farmers. What all farmers want to know is the truth and the facts. The facts are: 245 days; in Europe, 390 days; in America, if a person wants to lodge an anti-dumping claim, that person needs 10 tonnes of paper and is still sent back and told it is not enough information&mdash;and $1m to boot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the protectionists are still trying to use this as a means of holding up barriers that have cost us in the past. If all politicians told the truth on this matter and put Australian agriculture first, and told the clowns, the ratbags and the League of Rights the facts, we would not have these problems. And the Leader of the Liberal Party would not have to bring in a ridiculous amendment, which is not practical and will not work, just to please the backward regulators in the National Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the dumping of various products on the Australian market has, in recent years, emerged as a highly controversial issue. A number of well publicised cases have served to illustrate the dimensions of the problems and the detrimental impact that dumping has had on a wide range of domestic industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the cognate Bill, the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill, are an improvement but they need to go further, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has indicated. While most people are familiar with such highly publicised instances as the dumping of primary products, such as bananas, tomatoes, orange juice concentrate, dried apricots, canned peaches and so on, they are often unaware of the manufactured goods which are also dumped on the Australian market, often with devastating effect on the local industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that over the years Australia's trading fortunes have suffered enormously from the cumulative impact of our failure to control dumping and the disastrous consequences of the nation's structural uncompetitiveness, particularly its antiquated industrial relations system. The causes of the nation's slide into poverty are not difficult to identify. In addition to the ones already mentioned, they include high transport costs, communication and power costs, high business input taxes, high costs of capital, poor labour relations and low productivity, an inward focus encouraged by decades of protection and pervasive anti-business and anti-development attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia estimates that these major structural impediments cost Australians more than $40 billion each year, while businesses cost between 20 and 25 per cent higher than the nation's overseas competitors. This figure includes the impact of much of the government sector burden on business&mdash;payroll tax, wholesale tax, excessive and complex regulations, wasted expenditure and the estimated 10 per cent cost disadvantage caused by protracted environmental approval procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background of a hostile business environment, most local primary producers and manufacturers are in no position to defend themselves against the onslaught of dumped and subsidised products from overseas competitors. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in these circumstances the time and cost involved in mounting a dumping case is, in all but a few instances, absolutely prohibitive, and the present system still favours the people dumping products on the Australian market. Who is in a position to challenge them? Certainly not the huge number of primary producers and small businesses that are most effective. Clearly, their resources are limited and most are directed to the day to day cost of just staying in business. In contrast, the importers' problems are negligible; they have only to handle the finished goods and a couple of invoices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate, however, a more serious problem is that of the bureaucracy and the governments generally&mdash;particularly this one over the last 10 years. The problem is that, irrespective of the effects of its decision on business, the bureaucracy will continue to exist even if all products are imported and nothing is produced in Australia. It is my contention that, if Australian industry and the nation's primary producers are to survive, the decision-makers in the bureaucracy should not be even-handed. They should err on the side of local industry. Australia needs legislation and regulations which are fair and which protect local industries from the unfair competition of dumped goods from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to establish a situation and an attitude that care for Australian industries and recognise the problems that ensue when local producers are faced with unethical competition from overseas competitors. In this context, I believe that there are four main areas worthy of consideration. Firstly, I would place the onus of proof on the importer by having the goods withdrawn from sale until the importer proves that they are not being dumped; secondly, when the goods are imported, documentation must also indicate that the Australian design standards of safety, quality and performance are adhered to; thirdly, packaging and labelling requirements need to be strengthened; and, finally, all primary products imported into Australia should comply with Australian quarantine regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the adoption of these important provisions would do much to assist those Australian businesses threatened by unfair competition from dumping. At present, under current legislation, the Government has implemented a two-tier system involving Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority. As the system operates, the Australian Customs Service screens all complaints within a statutory time and determines whether a prima facie case exists. In the event that a prima facie case does exist, Customs investigates the case further and makes a preliminary finding. If there is a positive preliminary finding the case is transferred to the Anti-Dumping Authority,  which then conducts an inquiry and makes a recommendation to the Minister. The official time taken in dealing with each case amounts to 270 days, or nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the affected industry is hardly in a position to withstand the economic consequences of continued importation, particularly since during the time taken to investigate each case the importer is not placed in a position of responsibility. Indeed, it is the Australian industry which has to prove the case of material injury while the importer may continue to import goods under countervailing conditions, or continue to dump goods on the Australian market to the detriment of the local producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine it will come as no surprise to honourable members to learn that in the European Community the time taken to prove a dumping case is only a matter of days. During 1990 there was much publicity surrounding the importation and marketing of primary products which contravened the Anti-Dumping Act. The consequential destruction, or at best weakening, of various Australian industries received much publicity. The citrus industry is one case which has been on the verge of collapse for some time. Not surprisingly, this industry is facing impossible difficulties due to the importing of orange juice concentrate. Other instances involve the importation of frozen potatoes, canned asparagus and pork. Unlabelled canned peaches from Greece and unlabelled canned pears from China are two other examples. Australian industry, by world comparison, is often vulnerable due to its size and the relatively small capacity of the Australian domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, when a product is dumped or brought in under countervailing conditions&mdash;that is, subsidised in the country of origin&mdash;the Australian production is placed in a perilous position. In order to support Australian industry, I believe the onus of proof should be reversed so that it is incumbent upon the dumper to prove that dumping has not occurred. At the same time it must be recognised that the time taken to finalise each case is far too long and, irrespective of the time taken, the opportunity exists for an importer to continue importing goods to the detriment of the local producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industry does not, and should not, rely on tariffs or import quotas as a form of protection. Therefore, another form of preserving our industries must be implemented urgently. Under the coalition's Fightback program the delays would be minimal, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has already indicated. Moreover, I would argue that all imports should meet the Australian standards. Consumers in Australia must have confidence in the quality of all products and goods purchased in Australia, whether they are produced locally or imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, Australian standards are quite high and are the result of a consideration of international standards as well as domestic requirements. However, we must be constantly aiming for the competitive edge in quality, and that includes cost. Australian standards are compromised when poor quality imports impact on the local market. Living standards are threatened, while unfair competition from cheap, subsidised, poor quality imports is hardly in the nation's interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the question of packaging and labelling, Australian consumers have quite justifiably demanded more truth in labelling in recent years&mdash;a trend I fully support. However, there still exists the opportunity for ambiguity and deception. Let me illustrate my point simply with the example which concerns orange juice concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regulations permit the contents to be labelled as `Product of Australia' when in fact it is only the water that is Australian. In reality, there are some importers who use their own brands and have been known to supply mischievous or misleading information. When both the product and its package are totally Australian, the label should state that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, if any portion of the contents are packaged or imported, the following information should be included on the label: an accurate description of the product and a statement of its ingredients; the manufacturer's or processor's name; the importer's name; and the country of origin of the contents. The labelling should be in letters and numerals should be clearly visible and easy to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quarantine code should be an effective means of preventing the dumping of primary products on the Australian market. Regulations must offer an effective system of protection to our own industries so that it will be an uneconomic proposition to dump cheap subsidised goods in Australia that would simply not be warehoused or admitted under quarantine periods. I understand that the GATT agreement prohibits the use of quarantine regulations to control imports. However, the reality is that in some instances the regulations positively favour the importer. It is this aspect of the dumping problem that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was involved in a case last year concerning a local mushroom farm in my electorate of Dunkley. The business imported six containers of production equipment from the UK. It was all steel, manufactured and packaged in the Midlands of the UK, nowhere near a farm or potentially hazardous pests. On inspection at the wharf in Melbourne, timber packaging was discovered. The business was informed that it had to be fumigated at considerable cost. My constituent was in real trouble; he needed the equipment and he had organised installation people. Worst of all, the supervising engineer from the UK had other commitments and could only spare a few days. Many alternatives were offered, all to no avail. My constituent was forced to suffer, and suffer he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute farcical situation is that if he had imported mushrooms from a farm in Indonesia that were packed in wood, no fumigation was necessary because it would have contravened GATT and they could have been brought in duty free. These sorts of situations are nonsensical and overtly favour the importer against the Australian producer. The honourable member for Barker has outlined adequate anti-dumping measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 propose measures in relation to customs which will be of great interest to the people in my electorate of Oxley, especially the primary producers in the Lockyer Valley. In fact, I am sure that all primary producers will be interested in the measures that are being proposed here tonight. They are also of great interest to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-dumping measures proposed to be put in place are amongst the quickest anti-dumping measures in the world. The time it takes to get a preliminary decision in Australia will be around 125 days, which compares very favourably with between 141 and 186 days in Canada, between 160 and 200 days in the United States and up to 270 days in many of the European Community countries, which have not been referred to by the Opposition here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been quick to act on instances of dumping when it has found it occurring. Only last month, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) took action when canned tomatoes were dumped and subsidised into Australia from Italy, Thailand, China and Spain. This followed the lodgment of a complaint by Australian producers with the Australian Customs Service that the imported tomatoes were damaging the profitability of Australian tomato growers. Within four months of the tomato growers lodging their application for anti-dumping measures, provisional measures were introduced, which is a substantially smaller timeframe than exists in other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes follow last year's review of the anti-dumping system by the Federal Government. As a result of this review, the time that the Australian Customs Service has to decide whether dumping allegations warrant investigation has been reduced by 10 days, down from 35 days to 25 days. The proposal of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) tonight to introduce a timeframe of five days, which obviously would be impossible to achieve, appears to be just another of the Opposition's attempts at one-upmanship such as occurred with its tariff policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this, Customs will have another 100 days to make a preliminary judgment as to whether dumping has occurred. Finally, the Anti-Dumping Authority will have 120 days to undertake a final inquiry and recommend what dumping duties are to be imposed. Overall, the entire process will take about 245 days from start to finish. Once again, this overall time limit compares very favourably with those that exist in other countries. In Canada, the process takes at least 261 days, in the US it takes at least 280 days and in the European Community countries it takes some 390 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is the time taken to reach a preliminary finding. In addition to this reduction in investigation time, the actual length of time that the anti-dumping measures will be in place has been extended from three years to five years. Also, an interested party in a dumping case will be able to make a request to the Anti-Dumping Authority for a continuation of the anti-dumping measures that have been put in place. Such submissions will have to be received by the Authority no later than eight months before the expiry date for the measures in order to ensure that there is sufficient time for an inquiry to be made before the end of the five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is decided that the measures should continue, it will be up to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs to decide whether the measures are to be of the same type or magnitude. As well as the changes to the anti-dumping procedures that will occur as a result of this Bill, the life of the Anti-Dumping Authority itself will be extended until August 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government has introduced a strong anti-dumping framework, it has made it clear that it will not use the anti-dumping legislation in any way as a form of industry protection. It remains committed to the liberalisation of international trade to ensure the efficient use of our national resources. But, unlike Captain Zero&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is often referred to&mdash;and his henchmen opposite, this Government will achieve this through negotiations at an international level through the GATT processes and the Cairns Group and not by unilateral action of the type proposed by the Professor, who proposes simply to say to Australian producers, `Right, you have zero tariffs; now get out there and compete'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the changes that will occur in anti-dumping procedures, the Bills before the House also propose changes in relation to tariff concessions. At the moment, imports that have no effective alternative good that fulfils similar functions and is made in Australia are allowed duty free entry into the country under the existing commercial tariff concession system. The aim of this arrangement is to ensure that industries which use such products do not have their ability to compete in any way impeded by the tariff system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When tariff concession orders are granted to importers, they are able to import their goods free of import duty. The changes to tariff concession arrangements that will occur as a result of this legislation are a consequence of dissatisfaction with the present system. All the tariff measures introduced by this Bill complement the trade reforms this Government has introduced over the past nine years. We have worked constructively with industry and the trade union movement to open up Australian industry to competition in the international marketplace while keeping the social dislocation that is associated with structural change to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Leader of the Opposition and the economic vandals that back him, such as the honourable member for Barker, continue to parrot empty rhetoric about the need to reduce tariff levels, the conservative parties in this country have never attempted to address this vital issue. It has been only under the present Labor Government that protection levels have been reduced; for instance, in the clothing and textiles industry from 222 per cent to 52 per cent in 1983-84. Of course, there are others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Fraser and Howard&mdash;and now Hewson&mdash;were content to sit on their hands for seven years, this Government has embarked on a systematic program of tariff reductions from the 250 and 220 per cent levels of the Fraser years to target levels of 25, 15 and 5 per cent. In addition to its domestic program of tariff reduction, the Government has been at the forefront of international efforts to reduce trade barriers worldwide through its involvement in the Cairns Group and the Uruguay Round of the GATT trade talks. In contrast to the Fraser Government, which made no effort even to get the issue of the freeing up of trade in agricultural products on the international agenda, this Government has been actively pursuing this issue along with other members of the Cairns Group within the current Uruguay Round of the GATT talks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was the coalition not supportive of agricultural trade reform; it worked actively to undermine reform, with the then Deputy Prime Minister, Doug Anthony, walking out of the GATT discussion on agricultural protection during the 1970s. The Liberals were absolutely powerless&mdash;nothing has changed there&mdash;and totally useless in bringing about any real reform to international trade during their last term in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to cover up their past inadequacies in tariff reform, those opposite are now engaged in a pathetic game of one-upmanship, with the Leader of the Opposition now saying that he will cut back tariffs to zero, without any regard for the huge social costs involved in such a proposal. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker is another example of that one-upmanship. I did not wish to take up too much of the House's time, but only to make a few comments on this legislation, because of its importance to the primary producers in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill proposes some worthwhile amendments to Australia's anti-dumping procedures. It will speed up the process somewhat, tariff concession orders will be easier to get, the term of anti-dumping measures will be extended to five years and inquiries will begin before the expiry of duties. Those measures are welcome but they do not go anywhere near far enough. The coalition is proposing a further speeding up of the anti-dumping procedures as an amendment to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speed is an important factor in anti-dumping measures but it is not the only one. No matter how long it takes, it is most important that the correct decision is made and that threatened Australian industries get protection when they are exposed to unfair competition. This Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with fair competition. Australian industries which cannot compete against fair and honest trading from other parts of the world have to look at themselves and cannot expect protection under these sorts of measures. This Bill protects Australian industries which are facing unfair competition from dumping, countervailing measures and the like. It needs to be timely, not after the industries are dead, as occurred with the tomato processors. The assistance must be available on a timely basis to ensure that Australian industries are able to prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current anti-dumping measures are very costly, they are bureaucratic and they frighten off many affected industries. As the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) so ably pointed out, the procedures are loaded against the Australian industries so that many Australian industries do not even dare to attempt to get the protection which they ought to be entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have been calling for improvements to our anti-dumping measures for a long time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> editorial of 3 May referred particularly to the dumping of birdseed, peanuts and pork. I note the presence of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) at the table. I am sure that he ought to have been impressed because all of those three industries are relatively close to his own electorate. Unfortunately, nothing has been done to assist those industries and I am not sure that these measures will be sufficient to ensure that they get the kind of protection to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the Customs Service and the Australian Anti-Dumping Authority adopt an attitude towards Australian industry which is unsympathetic and unhelpful and ensures that the benefit of any doubt goes to the dumper&mdash;the offender. If confirmation is needed of what the attitude of the Anti-Dumping Authority really is on these questions one only has to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>of 21 January where the Executive Director of the Australian Anti-Dumping Authority, Mr Jock McGuire, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not here to protect anyone . . . When we go to a factory to assess if it is suffering material injury from imports, we want to find a bit of blood on the floor. That's what we want to see.</PARA>
<PARA>What sort of an organisation is this? Count Dracula? It wants the blood of workers and the blood of Australian producers before it is prepared to take any action. In other words, its attitude towards the whole question is a fundamental factor in the reason why our dumping procedures have not been working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an example of an industry where the whole picture of the effect of anti-dumping is graphically exposed it is the Australian peanut industry. The peanut industry has been suffering the effect of dumped Chinese peanuts for some time. The industry mounted a case and went to the Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority, both of whom acknowledged that dumping was occurring and acknowledged that the Australian industry was adversely affected, but refused to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If my comments are questioned, I will quote precisely from the report of the Anti-Dumping Authority when responding to the appeal lodged by the industry against the Customs Service. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority agrees with Customs that peanut kernels have been imported from China at dumped prices. But while Customs found only a few shipments to be dumped the Authority estimates that about 23 per cent of imports in 1991 were dumped at significant dumping margins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority also agrees that the Australian industry suffered material injury in 1990 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of the fact that the industry proved its case, there were still no anti-dumping duties imposed on the Chinese peanuts. The peanuts that are coming from China are not only dumped but also chemically contaminated and of generally poor quality. The National Health and Medical Research Council actually introduced and set higher permissible levels of organochlorin pesticide residues to accommodate the Chinese imports and, in so doing, helped to damage the good reputation of peanut products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that since 1987 peanut imports from China have increased from 2,053 tonnes to 8,374 tonnes&mdash;a 307 per cent increase&mdash;and that now represents over 30 per cent of the Australian market. These peanuts are being brought into Australia at prices up to $800 a tonne below the previous domestic prices in Australia, significantly reducing returns to local peanut farmers. Poor seasons have made it necessary to import some peanuts to make up the shortfall. But some importers want to institutionalise the imports to maximise their personal profits. Those dumped imports have destroyed the confidence of Australian peanut growers. Even when better seasons returned farmers failed to plant the previous acreages. In the past Australian farmers consistently planted between 30,000 and 35,000 hectares of peanuts. The current crop is just 23,000 hectares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, who is at the table, has no sympathy for the Australian peanut industry. He has defended the imports through press releases and the like and has heaped ridicule on the Australian industry, accusing it of merely trying to increase its market share. Of course it is trying to increase its market share at the expense of the dumped Chinese imports. I would have thought that it would have been entitled to the support of the Minister rather than his condemnation for its efforts in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peanut industry is exposed to every aspect of the current mechanisms in relation to tariff and trade arrangements. It is also suffering the impact of having to pay import duty on a lot of its machinery. Recently I had an opportunity to take up with the Minister the problems of an importer who is bringing peanut pulling equipment into Australia and having to pay 11 per cent duty. He has been unable to get any concessional order even though no similar machinery is made in Australia. I hope that the amendments to the legislation will give new hope to the importers of peanut machinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister stated as recently as 31 March this year in his letter to me that there would be no concessional order because there was a possible manufacturer by the name of McIntyre Precision Machinery at Cooran in Queensland which might be able to make these products. The facts are that the company has never made them. It is not located anywhere near the peanut growing areas and there was never any real possibility of its producing this equipment. I might add that it has an international patent protecting it anyway. However, in spite of all that, the Australian peanut producers who cannot get any protection against dumped products affecting their own market also cannot get any relief from the tariff that they are having to pay on much of their imported machinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current improvements to the legislation are welcome but they fall a long way short of what will be needed. What is fundamentally needed is a sea change in the attitude of the people administering Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. They need to adopt an attitude that is fundamentally sympathetic rather than antagonistic to Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to what the Government has been proposing, the National and Liberal parties will deliver a fairer trading environment for Australian industry upon returning to government. We will slash the amount of time taken to determine anti-dumping and countervailing cases and change the material injury test to ensure that an industry does not have to be decimated before remedial action can be taken. If there is to be any bias in an inquiry, the process should favour the Australian industry rather than the importer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns have been raised with me, although not specifically tonight in the debate on the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill. Those concerns are in relation to the practice of country hopping. After an application for anti-dumping action has been lodged with the Australian Customs Service, it can happen that importers begin to source their supplies from a country not named in the original application. If these imports too are dumped, the practice becomes known as country hopping. Country hopping has the potential to erode the benefits of the anti-dumping action. However, I am certain that such problems can be adequately addressed as they arise under the current provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the near future, I shall be writing to Customs and to the Anti-Dumping Authority asking that they act quickly in such cases where the Australian industry concerned can produce evidence of country hopping. I intend to make that letter public so that it becomes part of the mechanism. I will make sure that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) gets a copy. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is quite obvious: a reduction in the prima facie inquiry stage from 25 days to five days. We moved a second reading amendment which went much further than that. Of course, we are not able to deal with that in this committee stage. Some of the arrangements that we are proposing would run the Customs Service hearings and the ADA hearings concurrently and, therefore, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill would need a total revamping; otherwise we would have been disposed to move in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who spoke earlier, said that the Opposition, if I remember correctly, had never reduced protection or tariffs&mdash;I am not sure which word he used&mdash;and in the next breath said that the Opposition is on a one-way path to reducing protection to the point where it is running a scorched earth policy. I have to say to the honourable member that that is an illogical conclusion, on the one hand or the other. </PARA>

That was 14 years ago. I hope that some of us at least can get some credit for being consistent on this matter, even in our previous vocations&mdash;although I believe the Government will never give that credit to the Opposition. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3012" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GROOM">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The results of boards of inquiry are not normally made available for general information. I will release a summary of the Inquiry after the review processes are completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Army Board of Inquiry into the Nomad accident near Tenterfield commenced on 27 April 92 and was completed on 19 May 92. See also answer to (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) RAAF Nomad experienced a serious incident near Tindal on 17 September 91 (a) When full flap was selected prior to landing, the aircraft experienced pitch oscillations accompanied by violent fore/aft 'pumping' of the control wheel. The phenomenon disappeared when the flaps were retracted, allowing the aircraft to land safely. (b) The aircraft was damaged. (i) The damage consisted of structural deformation of the right aileron, impact damage to the right outboard flap from contact with the aileron mass balance, buckling of the right engine firewall, deformation of an engine access cowl, fractured or deformed right engine mounts and impact damage to the left flap caused by contact with the left aileron mass balance. (ii) The incident is still under investigation. The cause has not yet been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Nomad aircraft of the ADF were temporarily withdrawn from flying operations in early 1990 following the accident involving A18-401. The tailplane structure of all ADF Nomads was subject to inspection prior to the aircraft being returned to flying operations. The inspection revealed all ADF Nomad tailplanes to be airworthy. ADF Nomads were again withdrawn from flying operations following the accident involving A18-303 (Army, near Tenterfield). This was a routine precaution and the aircraft were returned to flying operations without undergoing any specific inspections when it was determined, during the early stages of the investigation, that structural failure was not involved. ADF Nomads were again withdrawn from flying operations following the accident involving A18-403 (RAAF, at Tindal) and currently remain at that status pending the determination of the cause of that event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Tests conducted by the RAAF Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) some time ago concluded that the N22 Nomad displayed inherent adverse longitudinal stability and control characteristics and theoretical susceptibility of the horizontal stabiliser to flutter. Studies conducted by Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL) showed the aircraft is prone to the development of a limited amplitude pitch instability at a frequency of 2Hz.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Army currently holds 13 Nomads. RAAF holds three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Numbers referred to in part 6 will vary. Army will receive an additional nine aircraft during the period April 92-May 93. One of the RAAF aircraft is expected to be withdrawn from service in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Existing Army fleet breakdown is 12 N22s and one N24. The additional aircraft will be five N22s and four N24s. Existing RAAF fleet composition is two N24s and one N22, with the N22 being the aircraft expected to be withdrawn from service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) (a) ASTA presented two structural modifications to all world wide NOMAD operators by Service Bulletin on 17 December 91 for incorporation by 30 April 92 with conditions relevant to modification kit provision and installation cost Debates. RAAF as an independent airworthiness authority, requested via both the NOMAD Joint Committee and independently through HQLC, that ASTA provide a fatigue substantiation plan to justify these modifications and substantiate a fatigue safe life for a modified tailplane. ASTA presented the RAAF with a final fatigue substantiation test plan and schedule on 14 April 1992. The plan and schedule are being reviewed by RAAF HQLC engineering staff to determine if the planned test activity is adequate. Following acceptance of ASTA's fatigue test plan and schedule, RAAF HQLC will consider modification incorporation following review of ASTA's test results and RAAF(ARDU) flight handling trials of a modified tailplane. (b) The Commonwealth, through Defence Outlay, will meet the cost of modification parts and will reimburse the ADF for installation costs providing modification incorporation is completed by the end of FY 93/94. Further, all Nomad aircraft on the Australian Civil Register were modified by 30 April 1992 in accordance with an Airworthiness Directive issued by the Civil Aviation Authority. All required modification kits have been assembled and incorporation in foreign registered aircraft is expected to be completed by the end of June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The Nomad aircraft was manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF). When GAF was corporatised, it became Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA). As part of the change, ASTA undertook to continue GAF's role as the Design Authority and Type Certificate holder for the Nomad but did not assume responsibility for GAF's activity prior to takeover and this remains the Commonwealth's responsibility. As part of the discharge of this obligation, the Commonwealth through Defence Outlay, funds ASTA approximately four million dollars per year to provide support to Nomad operators. One-off costs such as the tailplane modification mentioned in part (9) are also met by the Commonwealth through Defence outlay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The jurisdiction of the South Australian Coroner is exercised by him under state legislation. Any decision on whether and when an inquest is to be held or whether it will be dispensed with is a matter for him to determine in accordance with his powers. He has consulted the interested parties, including solicitors acting for the widow of the deceased pilot and the Commonwealth. On several occasions the Coroner, in correspondence and discussions has estimated dates when an inquest might have occurred, had he decided to proceed as events then stood, including the February 1991 date; these were estimates only and were not dates set or influenced by Commonwealth authorities. The Commonwealth has supplied the Coroner and other parties with information relating to the accident and will cooperate in the exercise of the State jurisdiction but it is not in a position to influence the Coroner's jurisdiction exercised under State law. The specific matter raised in this question are not ones for the Department of Defence to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) No common links have been established between the accidents and incidents involving ADF Nomad aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Information in respect of the number of Nomads operational outside Australia is not held by Defence.</PARA>
