<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supply Bill (No. 3) 1992-93 seeks additional interim appropriations of $65m for recurrent Commonwealth Government expenditures, while Supply Bill (No. 4) 1992-93 seeks additional interim appropriations of $105m to meet capital works expenditure, payments to the States, and similar non-recurrent outlays. We are also debating cognately the Loan Bill, which makes provision for the financing of the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit of some $13.389 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's Budget deficit is expected to give rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of around $6 billion greater than the Budget deficit itself. As is the usual practice, this deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be met from the Loan Fund as provided for in the Bill. Each of these three Bills is quite unprecedented in its own way, and together they reflect the disastrous state that the Commonwealth finances have fallen into under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supply Bills 3 and 4 are unprecedented in that they are additional to Supply Bills 1 and 2, which were passed by Parliament as recently as 2 June this year in the usual way. In the past, Supply Bills 1 and 2 have almost always been sufficient to provide for the ongoing annual services of government up until 30 November when the Budget Appropriation Bills are usually passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supply Bill (No. 1) provided $12.4 billion for this purpose, which was $320m or 2.7 per cent more than the equivalent Bill for the year before. Supply Bill (No. 2) passed earlier this year provided an additional $4 billion, which was $600m or 17.3 per cent more than that provided for the previous year. Supply Bills 1 and 2 reflected the additional `One Job' statement expenditures which were made over and above those outlays provided in the 1991-92 Budget and which have contributed to the continuing blow-out in the Commonwealth Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now we find the Government is coming to us again and asking for even more money to tide it over until November&mdash;shades of the banana republic we heard of a few years ago! This is at the same time as the Government's Appropriation Bills have been introduced in the usual Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amounts sought in these two Supply Bills are relatively small but the small sums involved beg the question as to why they could not be met in the usual way out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance,  which for the sake of brevity I will refer to as the AMF. The AMF is the usual financing mechanism for unforeseen expenditures that cannot be met out of the appropriations already approved by the Parliament. In his second reading speech on Supply Bill (No. 3) the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reliance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for these purposes would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>This is despite the fact that Supply Bills Nos 1 and 2 from earlier this year allocated $170m and $140m respectively to the AMF for exactly these contingencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional Supply Bills before the House also seek additional funds in areas of expenditure that were already generously provided for in Supply Bills Nos 1 and 2&mdash;principally `One Job' pump priming and pork-barrelling. These Bills and the Government's actions can have only one possible explanation: the Government is clearly making provision for a huge increase in Government expenditure in the early months of this financial year for the purposes of softening up the electorate in advance of the next general election. The Government is gearing up for one almighty pork-barrelling campaign while it cloaks its intentions in the rhetoric of speeding up the budgetary assistance to the ranks of the unemployed that its own policies have created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are these Bills a clear indication of the Government's intention ahead of the next election, but they are also indicative of the Government's continued mismanagement of the Commonwealth's finances. It was only a few months ago, in March this year, that the Government resorted to an additional Appropriation Bill in the form of Appropriation Bill (No. 5), at the same time as Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 were still before the Parliament. In that instance we had the Government tacking an additional Appropriation Bill to a cognate debate for Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4, which already included the appropriations to be authorised by Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then had to go to extraordinary lengths to move amendments to delete the relevant expenditures from Bills Nos 3 and 4 to reflect the fact that they were now included in Bill No. 5. That Bill was then shoved through the Senate ahead of Bills Nos 3 and 4 to provide the Government with funds that it argued could not be provided through the Advance to the Minister for Finance.  There is absolutely no end to this Government's incompetence. Rather than learning from its mistakes, the Government is presenting us with the same lame arguments for a second time with these two additional Supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second time this year that the Government has been forced to introduce additional legislation merely to meet its ongoing spending requirements. But the Government's incompetence in this regard does not stop there. It would appear that, in the schedules accompanying these Bills, the Government has transposed the figures sought by it through the Bills. The result is that in Supply Bill (No. 3) the Government is authorised to spend $105m but only $65m is supplied, while the reverse holds true for Supply Bill (No. 4). Of course, this error can be dealt with in a number of ways without causing undue difficulty, but it points to the way in which Ministers introduce legislation in this Parliament with scant regard to and absolutely no knowledge of the details of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's Budget legislation is already in a mess, in large part due to the Government's financial ineptitude. This has been brought on in part by the recession we had to have, but also because the Government has presided over a blow-out in expenditure to finance its coming re-election campaign. The Government is going to try to buy the next election with money it does not have, which ultimately means buying it with money conscripted from the Australian people. Nowhere is this better indicated than in the provisions of the Loan Bill, one of several such Bills introduced during the life of this Parliament since the Government gave up the ghost of trying to realise a Budget surplus during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deterioration in the Commonwealth Government's finances over the last 12 months has been nothing short of spectacular&mdash;a monument to its fiscal ineptitude. The Government went from an estimated Budget deficit for 1991-92 of $4.732 billion to an actual Budget deficit outcome of $9.339 billion. This represents a change in the outcome of more than $11 billion&mdash;the Government was out by $11 billion. We should not forget that the 1990-91 outcome was a reversal of the 1989 outcome by more than $6 billion. Since 1989-90 we have seen a turn for the worse in the Commonwealth Government's finances totalling more than $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have before us the 1992-93 Budget which proposes as its starting point a Budget deficit of some $13.4 billion&mdash;a prospective change on the previous year's outcome of some $4 billion. The starting point deficit for 1992 is estimated at 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Total outlays in this year's Budget will increase by 4.1 per cent in real terms. As a percentage of GDP, outlays are expected to rise to 27 per cent as a result of this year's Budget. However, the real Budget deficit is concealed by the Government's usual Budget fiddles, as are the real increases in the Federal Government's own purpose spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one takes into account the $1.6 billion proceeds from asset sales and $1.1 billion in abnormal profits from the Reserve Bank of Australia, the deficit blows out to $16.1 billion. According to Alan Kohler, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the real deficit is more like $21 billion when one discounts for some of the more dubious Budget transactions which serve to obscure the gap between the Government's operating expenses and tax receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the major concern with this Budget is the financing requirement it generates. This year's Budget deficit implies  a financing requirement of $18.5 billion in this financial year alone. But between now and 1995 there is more than $50 billion in unfunded spending proposed by Labor which must be financed by issuing new debt. We all know that new debt raised on domestic capital markets ultimately means higher interest rates. It is of course higher interest rates which are responsible for killing off the business investment we need so desperately to get the economy going again. It is higher interest rates which attract capital inflow, which in turn contributes to the current account deficit. It is not surprising, therefore, to see private sector forecasts that the current account deficit will nearly double from $11.8 billion in 1991-92 to more than $21 billion by 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder then that the Government was forced to mention at least the possibility of increased taxes in the Budget Speech. Without such a reference, the markets would have been totally spooked by the question of where the money for all of this so far unfunded expenditure was meant to be coming from. So we have the markets to thank for confirming the coalition's exposure of the Government's secret tax agenda before the next election, part of which will undoubtedly include an expansion of the wholesale sales tax base to bring about a de facto consumption tax, but with none of the advantages of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is undoubtedly part of the rationale behind the sales simplification exercise, the legislation for which the Government is trying to push through the Senate ahead of the next election. The Government has already flagged that it will be slugging us with a domestic interest withholding tax, an expanded prescribed payments system and a broader fringe benefits tax base. On page 4.41 of Budget Paper No. 1, the Government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maintain the structure of the revenue base and reduce the prospective deficit for 1995-96 the Government is prepared to consider reforms to the domestic interest withholding tax, the scope of the PPS arrangements and the FBT system . . . if nearer to the time the prospective deficit is as now projected.</PARA>
<PARA>We have known for some time that the Government would like to see withholding tax applied to all interest payments made to all Australian taxpayers. This would mean that people on lower marginal income tax rates would be forced to reclaim overpayments of tax from the Tax Office at the end of the financial year, at the miserable interest rates for which the ATO is notorious. Too bad if people need those interest payments to live on during the financial year. People on higher rates of income tax would be denied the option of paying their tax in one lump sum at the end of the financial year. Instead, it will be a requirement that tax be deducted automatically from their interest payments before they are even made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In theory, a withholding tax should not raise any revenue, since it is only meant to bring forward provisional tax liabilities. However, the Tax Office claims that such a tax would bring in revenue by eliminating some of the possibilities for avoiding tax on interest payments. The point to be made about that is that we already have a tax file number system which was meant to close down most, if not all, of those avenues for avoiding tax. Any additional revenue the Government expects to collect from the imposition of a domestic withholding tax can only be indicative of a serious failure in the tax file number system to do the job it is meant to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax file number system poses numerous threats to the privacy of all Australians, but we tolerate it in the belief that it is a necessary evil that will help protect the revenue and protect against social security fraud. But it would appear that the tax file number system is not working effectively in the former case, in which case we probably need to re-evaluate the costs and benefits of this intrusive system of surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's Budget Paper No. 1 anticipates raising $2 billion to $3 billion from these proposed new tax measures alone; never mind the secret tax agenda of expanding the wholesale sales tax base which the Government has in the bottom drawer for after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also disturbing about this Budget, apart from the Government's prospective new taxes, is the extent to which recurrent outlays are to be paid for by borrowing or through asset sales. Ten per cent of the Government's recurrent outlays are to be paid for in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what this Budget means is that we are going into debt to pay for totally unproductive consumption spending by the Commonwealth, with only the promise of higher taxes in the future as a means of repaying the debt. It is not surprising, therefore, to see that this Budget presides over a blow-out in gross Commonwealth public debt interest payments. Public debt interest will become the largest contributor to the real growth in Budget outlays between now and 1995-96. The Government has been arguing that the various measures of public sector debt and expenditure are relatively favourable compared with those that prevailed during the 1982-83 recession. Apart from the essential irrelevance of what happened 10 years ago, these figures ignore the fact that public sector investment is much lower now than it was at that time, which is enabling the Government to get away with a smaller public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the deterioration in the Commonwealth Budget outcome between June 1990 and June 1993 is expected to total some $21 billion. This is a turnaround that is more than double the size of the deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances during the 1982-83 recession, and it is 20 per cent larger than the 1982-83 turnaround relative to gross domestic product. Those figures provide a far more realistic assessment of the magnitude of the budgetary blow-out than has occurred under this incompetent Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also fond of regaling us with figures showing that Australia is one of the lowest taxing countries in the OECD. This ploy simply ignores the fact that the OECD standard in this case is not a very high one. Most OECD countries have oversized public sectors. Some, such as Sweden, have some of the highest rates of taxation in the world. What the OECD comparisons ignore are some of the fast-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region, which are not members of the OECD and which have very low rates of taxation and very lean public sectors. If we want to make these sorts of comparisons, we should compare ourselves with the best in the world, and not with countries which have many of the same problems of oversized government as we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all these figures add up to is a government that cannot deliver on either its promised personal income tax cuts or its promise to return the Budget to surplus by 1995-96. At the very least, one must give way to the other, but it is more likely that neither could be realised, assuming the Government were in office long enough to give it a try. The Government is in the position of making promises it manifestly cannot keep. The money simply is not there without higher taxes, much higher than the Government has been prepared to concede to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best the Government can come up with is totally unfunded consumption expenditure aimed at the few months before the next election, with absolutely no regard for the consequences that will stem from rising Commonwealth and public sector debt levels. If the Opposition put forward such a program instead of the Fightback package, we would have been rightly crucified for it. All these budgetary problems are being pushed out until after the next election, when it will undoubtedly be left to the coalition to pick up the pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is throwing money at a host of dubious projects that create short term jobs at taxpayers' expense, but longer term unemployment as we find ourselves struggling to cope with the public sector debt that this Government is foisting on us. The Government simply has no concept of acting responsibly in times of economic crisis. It is obsessed with winning the next election, and anything that it thinks will help it towards that goal is worth a try, as far as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is concerned. It has not even occurred to the Government to try cutting business costs to elicit more productive investment from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government really wanted to bring forward economic recovery and job growth associated with it, there are a host of responsible measures that it could take to achieve those two worthy objectives. It could begin by abolishing a whole raft of taxes on business and consumers alike, such as the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise, along with the training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee levy. Reducing the overall tax burden, particularly the high incidence of personal income tax, would be an excellent way to get the economy moving again. The compliance and collection costs of the taxation system and the waste generated through the administration of government programs can be short circuited by allowing taxpayers to retain and spend their hard earned dollars directly in the way that suits them best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could continue to phase out tariff protection and other non-tariff barriers to trade so that Australians could access imports at world prices. An accelerated privatisation program would enable the Government to use the proceeds from asset sales to retrench public sector debt and thereby reduce the debt servicing burden plaguing the Federal Budget. Instead of this approach, which the coalition will be taking on assuming office, the Government will spend some $3.4 billion over the next two years to create a miserable 27,000 jobs. This pales into insignificance alongside the two million jobs that can be created by Fightback while we rein in government spending at same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters are not helped by the fact that the Government is increasingly hamstrung in its budgetary policy by the accord process with the ACTU. In order to secure wage restraint from the ACTU, the Government has found it necessary to offset lower real wages with budgetary concessions which have greatly reduced the flexibility of fiscal policy. This has been one of the causes of the Government's excessive reliance upon monetary policy to achieve its objectives, a reliance which will only increase with this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the many failures of the accord process has been the fact that whereas accord-sponsored wage restraint was meant to lessen the Government's reliance on monetary policy, the impact of accord deals on fiscal policy has meant that this Government has been more reliant on changes in monetary policy settings than just about any other government in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to conceive of a Budget more irresponsible than this one. The Budget is the exact opposite of what is needed at this point in time. The Government has opted for what it considers to be the tried and true solution to electoral difficulty. The Government is to continue to try to spend its way out of trouble. It is a thoroughly discreditable political ploy, but one which the Government is prepared to try anyway. From an economic point of view, however, the Government is just trying to buy our way into more and deeper trouble. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that these programs have not been funded through the Budget; they have. It is simply that we care about real people with real problems. If we left these programs to be funded totally through the normal Budget Appropriation Bills, we would have to wait until December to help the people out there who have been hurting because of the recession. I can imagine how the dreary procession of depressing and negative speeches, such as the one we have just heard, will come from the other side over the next 12 months, telling us over and over again how we should not be spending our way out of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inference, of course, is that we should not be helping the multitude of taxpaying Australians and their families who need our help during these hard times. If I hear another speaker opposite talk about this being Paul Keating's recession I will be sick. If it is Paul Keating's recession, he must rival Gandalf the Wizard for his ability to be in many places at the same time. Many countries are suffering from this recession. Is Paul Keating that powerful? I know the Opposition would like the Australian public to believe so, but somehow I do not think the Australian public is quite that gullible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, we are spending our way out of this recession and we are proud of it. These Supply Bills will enable us to start spending as quickly as possible on programs that will help those Australians who are most disadvantaged. We will not have to wait until the end of the year to help them. If we see someone in need we do not feed their particulars into a cold computer model to see whether they are expendable or to see whether they are lucky enough to be helped. In the Labor Party we are old-fashioned; if people need help, we help them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, those on the other side only feign help. They talk in macro terms. They talk always of the big picture. They talk about their mighty new god called Fightback, but Fightback shows no mercy. He would have suited well the lofty heights of Mount Olympus, or have been comfortable in the halls of Valhalla looking down on mere mortals with derision, arrogant in the knowledge that Fightback was all wise, all seeing and all knowing, and that the people who inhabited the earth below were his playthings, things to be experimented with. For Fightback is an experiment, let there be no doubt about that. There is no guaranteed outcome. It could create chaos. It could make Australia a better place, but at what cost? No-one really knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is asking us to take one big gamble. I do not mind a gamble myself, but this is one bet I would not take. And as the form guide becomes more clear to Joe and Jane Public, I do not think they will be willing to take a punt either. The opinion polls over the last few days are already showing that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even though there are no guaranteed outcomes in regard to Fightback, we can get some indication as to how things might be. These two Supply Bills are good examples. They are designed to fund programs to help people who are disadvantaged by the recession, and to help people as quickly as possible. That sounds a noble motive, but do honourable members think that those opposite will be applauding our swift call to arms to try to get these programs up and running as quickly as possible? I doubt it very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, those opposite will be negative. Their speeches will paint gloomy pictures of a country with no hope unless we put a 15 per cent tax on food and clothing, which are currently untaxed. Then for some reason, a reason that totally escapes me, everything will get better. It is a wonder that Fightback does not have another chapter about the fairies down at the end of the garden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Supply Bill (No. 3) the Government is seeking interim appropriations of some $65m, while Supply Bill (No.4) is seeking interim appropriations of some $105m to last until 30 November, when it is anticipated that the Budget Appropriation Bills will be finally enacted. Naturally, this is after being constantly verballed by the doom merchants opposite. This $170m package has a specific purpose of creating jobs with the shortest possible lead-up time. But those opposite would rather not have those jobs. According to them, one does not spend one's way out of recession; one cuts and slashes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a good cartoon in one of the papers recently that depicted an emaciated Australia lying on an operating table with the Leader of the Opposition, gloved up ready for surgery, looking at his new patient. The other doctors, the interns&mdash;they might have been his shadow ministry&mdash;were looking up at their spiritual leader with a look of eager hope in their eyes. The good doctor finally had his chance to operate on poor old Australia, his long sought after patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the implication was that he was already the Prime Minister by this stage. Poor old Australia was there wasting away to nothing, panting its last gasps on the Leader of the Opposition's operating table. `What is the cure?', chanted those who followed him blindly; `How will we fix this country?'. The good doctor's solution to this pathetic image of Australia, looking like one of those awful Bangladesh magazine photos of a starving child, was, `It's obvious. This patient needs a crash diet'. This is what Australia will be getting from Dr Hewson: a crash diet. A patient comes into a hospital and says, `Doctor, I think I have anorexia nervosa'. `Good', says the doctor, `Stop eating.

We have looked down at the same patient on the operating table and sensibly inserted a drip in the patient's arm. It is a drip that will feed money back into the economy; a drip that will lessen the feeling of despair that envelops too many Australians; a drip that will boost consumer spending which, in turn, will lead to an increase in business confidence. In the long run, this will lead to more Australians getting back to work, something that everyone on this side of the House is working towards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders whether those opposite really want people to get back into employment as quickly as possible. It does not make much sense, I know, but if this had been their Budget there would be no Supply Bills such as these. The Leader of the Opposition and the blind mice that follow him would have allowed no job creation programs. In Supply Bill (No.3) the Government is seeking $50m for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry. I know from personal experience how these programs can help people.

As a result, Stradbroke Island was declared a region of employment disadvantage under the Office of Labour Market Adjustment. This meant that Stradbroke Island unemployed people were given increased access to government labour market programs. We are not talking about a great deal of money or a great number of unemployed.

Recently I had the pleasure of representing the Prime Minister at the Queensland Skillshare awards and handing out the top State awards.

To put it on the record because she deserves it, the top Queensland Skillshare graduate for the year is a mother by the name of Kerry McKey who lives in Wynnum West in my electorate.

As most honourable members will know, group schemes are jointly funded by federal and State moneys and the majority of these schemes work towards the day when they become self-sufficient. The success of the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme is due entirely to its conducting live work exercises, particularly through a joint venture with the State Department of Housing and Local Government, which has generously provided a unique facility which allows an unusual emphasis on developing hands-on skills. In short, this means that apprentices in this scheme help build houses. How much more practical can you get? The most significant achievement of the Queensland housing and construction group training scheme, as proudly stated by its manager, Don Row, is that practically all the scheme apprentices are finding suitable employment on completion of their indentures, many with their former host employers. </PARA>

I am particularly glad that a number of students, some 53 in all, from St Annes and Gippsland Grammar School from the City of Sale in my electorate are present in the gallery this morning. It is a very good school and I happen to know that these are particularly good students of that school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After those introductory remarks I would like to confine my comments to the scientific and technological features of the Bills. In themselves these are issues of great significance for the future competitiveness of the national economy. The community well appreciates the great task that lies before us of rebuilding the economy. This task involves reforming a vast array of traditional practices, of overcoming entrenched structural obstacles and exorcising an array of government driven disincentives which have historically blocked Australia's opportunity to create a genuinely competitive international economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the setting of this framework of change, science and technology plays an important role. The capacity of the Australian economy to draw on knowledge based processes and products is central to the task of reform. It is central not just as a means of winning unexpected breakthroughs in marketable products&mdash;probably too much is made of this&mdash;but through developing a business culture which is bent on upgrading constantly its technical base and stimulating company practices which are committed to continued improvements. This is an underestimated process crucial to any aspirations we have of achieving global competitiveness, and it is often overlooked as a consequence of R&amp;D spending. But we are a long way from pulling this off, from making any marked gains on this front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an indication of just where matters stand at present. On the basis of pre-recession figures, Australian business expenditure on R&amp;D is still about half of the OECD average, and we have been lapped a few times by the top eight R&amp;D performing countries. If the business sector talks amongst itself about these matters, we can well realise what shape the current figures are in. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics survey for 1990-91 signals a 3 per cent fall in private sector investment in R&amp;D. According to the ABS, we are the second lowest of the larger Western economies in regard to business investment in R&amp;D as a share of output. On top of this, the number of business enterprises conducting R&amp;D has fallen by around 13 per cent, as have the human resources devoted to research and development activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s there were improvements, as there were in other small OECD states with traditionally low levels of investment in research and development. There has also been a good deal of reshuffling of definitions of R&amp;D activities for statistical and other reasons. But Australia is well off the international pace regardless of how the figures are twisted and contorted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those honourable members familiar with the R&amp;D activities of the manufacturing sector would grasp just how gloomy the news really is. In all but one of the 17 major manufacturing industries in this country we have failed to reach OECD average levels of investment. In 11 of these, R&amp;D intensities have fallen off in recent years. Similarly, the take-up of advanced technology in manufacturing is at a low ebb. Reports to the Prime Minister's Science Council confirmed that Australia's manufacturing technologies are relatively basic and that even local investment in  machine tools  was  15  to  18  per  cent that of regional countries as well as the OECD states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But enough of the figures. Suffice it to say that this trend cannot continue its unsustainable path for the Australian economy. As a nation we cannot afford any longer to have a media circus celebrating the technological hype and forgetting market realities. Some simple commonsense is called for. If commercialisation strategies are to be discussed, then they have to be locked into an analysis of what kind of across-economy settings are most advantageous to their success. We have to heed the type of economic environment which fires successful companies, drives innovative managerial practices and creates the effective manufacturing, supply and marketing networks which surround them. We need to face up to the types and quality of interaction between the public research sector and the private research sector, which are needed as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate and commentaries about science and technology policy are getting to be a bit like a soap opera. There is a belief that Australia has just about got the technology right, but that business has lost the plot. It is a regrettable assumption which predominates in public debate. The fact of the matter is that this country does not possess an integrated technological and industrial base. Similarly, it has not moved to integrate its skills development patterns with its industrial needs. It is the odd nation out in the OECD in this regard, and this is a telling observation on our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise enough the need for the business sector to weigh into the debate about how best to utilise the available technological resources. It has a heavy responsibility to get its point across about what needs to be done with the existing research resources and infrastructure base. There are grave problems. The university sector has about half the level of industry related research activity as is the OECD average; 2.6 per cent of research funds come from industry against a 5 per cent average for the OECD. This is despite the frequent boast that we possess amongst the best educational infrastructure and training in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, research and technology acquisition have a vital role in building on mature production processes, sponsoring a culture of continued improvement across companies, and breaking into areas of new product design and development. But the bulk of the spending which takes place in respect of these roles is in the private sector itself. As such, they are extremely sensitive to cost and supply factors which soak up profits and choke investment. The Bureau of Industry Economics surveys demonstrate this. It is commonsense to the private sector, but it is absent from the public debate about commercialisation strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the structural characteristics of Australia's economic history, we do not have a long experience in the role of high technology applications in business strategies, production planning or marketing. Some points are obvious enough. Increased rates of technology transfer will not be significantly altered until overall economic conditions are conducive to promoting conventional, competitively driven sources of change. Companies do not work on the basis of goodwill, to state the obvious. They need to have confidence in their economic position in both the short term and the long term and they need to have confidence in technology and how it is packaged and geared to the market. We should not expect the capital markets to move a centimetre towards high technology stocks until they see this process in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be understood that the creation of intellectual property in itself is a vastly less expensive process than is its further product development and marketing stages. These latter stages of research and development are therefore directly influenced by: concerns arising from the cost and availability of capital; rates of capital stock replacement within the manufacturing sector which determine the capacity of companies to swing into new processes; cash flow; company size and managerial expertise; input costs in production processes; barriers to entry to markets; and the relative efficiencies of supply and transport networks. In this wider context it should be possible to identify those areas in which action is needed and by whom. My point is that commercialisation, in large measure, is part and parcel of a wider economic and industry debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to notice in all of this that it is obvious that the issue of communication and dialogue is critical to developing any practical or genuine national effort in respect of capitalising on opportunities. Research, developmental and marketing efforts must be organically linked processes. There is no substitute for dovetailing research at the project stage with company capabilities and needs and international market intelligence. Given the depth of international technology reservoirs and the speed at which market opportunities open and close, as well as the extent of the existing technological gap, if you like, between ourselves and our trading rivals, there can be no other effective means of building a competitive technological capability than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at countries which are serious as to their technological base, we will see a high level of interaction between business and researchers. We will also see greater understanding as to how resources are allocated across the totality of that effort. No doubt industry and the research community will both need to tilt their perspective or give some ground if this level of organisation is to be achieved. But I think the days of allowing sectors of our technological and research activities to run too far ahead of our business priorities have come to a close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have a great deal of understanding of the nature of the interface between technology and established industries. So debates about science and technology policy often turn out to be a string of homilies. But this belies the seriousness of the problems we have on our hands and the scope of the change we must pursue. For example, we have got a real problem on our hands with the smaller company base in the economy which is geared to high volume, low technology, domestic sales strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an area in which, in the current circumstances, there is not even a murmur of substantive interest in technological applications. It is in this area that new opportunities, for example, for interaction with the public research base should be provided. The smaller, dispersed manufacturing belt in this country needs to reorganise itself around research and development facilities, and it needs to be put in a competitive position to want to make use of those resources. If it is to make use of those resources it must be able to do so in circumstances in which it is confident its priorities will drive its investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate goal of government policy, the final policy settings, must be to aggressively create a new environment in which Australian businesses can build a serious commitment to research and development. We are going to have to claw our way into the game. There is a long way to go and some innovative thinking is desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this regard that I bring to the attention of the House the attack on the coalition's consultation process with the science, technology, business and industry groups. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) last week seized on one dated set of the Federal Opposition's working documents which were being discussed with the science constituency. What did he do with them? He manufactured a puerile scare campaign which has even drawn the criticism of the largest representative professional body of the scientific and technological communities, FASTS, whose membership now comprises some 70,000 active researchers, academics and scientific administrators across Australia. This is what FASTS had to say about the scare campaign which the Minister for Science and Technology tried to whip up:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scientific and technological community is working closely with the Coalition on their policies. FASTS Board at its meeting in June, in fact, considered the papers which have now been leaked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Science and Technology, Ross Free does his cause great harm by suggesting the scientific and technological community is being hoodwinked by the Coalition.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nickname "agenda-Free" &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which, frankly, I have to claim credit for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is perhaps unfortunate but it would have less currency if we had some constructive ideas from the Government rather than misinformation about what the Coalition will or will not do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We strongly support the Coalition's direction for research which will massively improve private sector investment while maintaining the integrity of the public sector. We do not believe that the Coalition will dismantle the CSIRO if they win the next election. It is scaremongering of the Minister to suggest that it would.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has also tried to whip up a bit of hysteria about ideas the coalition is seeking formal advice on regarding Australia's marine science effort. He is telling the people of Townsville that we will close down and dismantle the Australian Institute of Marine Science, AIMS, and rip funds out of the marine science base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the scientific community well knows, that is another embarrassing and utterly misrepresentative accusation by the Minister. The coalition is actively working with the research community on developing new ways to better utilise Australia's marine science resources based in Townsville. It may well be the case that the retention of AIMS is the best outcome for marine science but that will depend on the advice of those active in the field&mdash;those in the relevant marine science research and industry groups with whom the coalition is conferring, regularly and systematically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other recommendations. Some suggest that, with two bodies of marine science research expertise sitting alongside one another in Townsville, there is scope for an ambitious initiative&mdash;an initiative which would create an integrated, internationally competitive marine science research facility with a national charter operating through James Cook University. This is an idea that the coalition wants to test. It is not a policy setting, but it is an option that needs to be pursued and investigated, not for political purposes but in the expectation that it could yield a real national benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Minister for Science runs off cynically manipulating the community with his pathetic scare campaigns, perhaps he would like to take this option and consider it. Indeed, I would like to extend to the Minister for Science an opportunity to work with the scientific community in the universities and the industry groups as I have. He should go and ask them to evaluate the option of creating an international-sized, competitive, integrated marine science research and teaching facility at Townsville, operating through a national charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should ask James Cook University whether it has the resources and the enthusiasm to make something as prospective and exciting as this take place. The Minister, despite the departmental resources at his command, has never been able to generate an idea for the future, so I am throwing him one from the coalition. This is the Minister's big chance in his portfolio: a chance to investigate and evaluate a real policy option in an honest and open way with the marine science community and industry and university constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has never done this before. He might feel a little apprehensive and a little at sea but, if he chose to work with the constituency which he is meant to represent, he might&mdash;as I do&mdash;find it a thoroughly rewarding experience. On this basis, I look forward to reading of the Minister's announcement that he intends to investigate the prospects for further development of Townsville's marine science base. I look forward to seeing him do this in an honest and open way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I have no wish to drag Australia's marine science community into a worthless and unnecessary political debate, despite what the Minister has done of late.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This second reading debate on the Supply Bill (No. 3) 1992-93 and cognate Bills gives us a chance to have an overview of some aspects of economic policy. I want to use that chance to discuss the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is an influential coordinating body of the rich countries, the Western industrialised countries, and it has considerable influence over national economic policies. Every 15 months or so a report is prepared on each of the 24 member countries, including Australia. Those reports are taken seriously both here and in the other countries, so the ideas that are expressed in them are important. Those ideas have been demonstrated to be misjudged in a number of ways, in the last two or three years particularly, and to show a lack of balance. Those are the themes I want to take up in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I begin that analysis, it is worth giving a little background on the organisation, because it may not be well known to everyone. It was founded in 1961. It now has 24 member countries, mostly in western Europe but also including Japan, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. A number of what used to be developing countries have so increased their per capita incomes that their incomes are higher than those of some of the members of the OECD and they too are considering applying for membership. I refer to countries such as the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Whether they will be admitted to membership remains to be seen, and they have not yet formally applied, but it does show a change in the global economic situation since the organisation was formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aims of the OECD are threefold: to achieve the highest sustainable rate of economic growth while maintaining financial stability, to promote free trade, and to support development in poorer non-member countries. These are three unexceptionable aims which it has contributed towards achieving in a number of useful ways, but which it has not achieved as well as could have been possible. It is those kinds of analyses that I want to turn to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect that the organisation's main value is through the way it becomes a centre for the distribution of ideas. Ministers from member countries attend ministerial meetings and committee meetings. We have an ambassador there, as do other member countries. There are a number of committees looking not only at economic policy but also at social, employment and development policies. There is a particularly useful development assistance committee that meets once a year, normally in December, and which I attended two or three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tasks for which the OECD is best known is its economic forecasts. It publishes these forecasts every six months in the OECD <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS>. The most recent was for June 1992. These forecasts are a valuable assessment of the economic prospects for the next year or two of the industrialised Western countries. There has been some criticism of the accuracy of the forecasts. I think it is very difficult to be too trenchantly critical of any organisation for not getting its forecasts right, because it is an extremely complex and difficult task. The OECD's record for the area as a whole tends to be not too bad, but its record for particular countries is not quite as good. That is to be expected because it is not as directly or closely in touch with member countries as are the economic forecasting agencies in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My central point concerns the somewhat critical comments about the OECD's stance during the 1980s. The OECD could be described as a group of economic rationalists. It is a term we now often hear used about the Australian Treasury, and I think the same sorts of orientation exist in the OECD. For example, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS> some time ago talked about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the dictates of those passionate free market economists&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>working at the OECD; the name of the principal economist was mentioned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who ceaselessly preach a gospel of deregulation and liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS> went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Time and again, the neo-classical OECD of the 1980s has emphasised the dangers of `structural rigidities' and made a trenchant case for microeconomic reforms. How dispiriting it must be to discover that such policies have only limited relevance in the real world. Countries, such as the UK and US, which have deregulated with gusto, are in an economic mess. Those, such as Japan and West Germany, which have been wary of free market prescriptions, are doing brilliantly well.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a point well taken. It is not to say that micro-economic reform is not important or relevant, but that the benefits of micro-economic reform are limited and we should keep those benefits in proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the principal characteristics of the attitudes of the OECD could be expressed as including restrictiveness of public expenditure. It wants always to minimise public expenditure, regardless of the economic or social objectives for which that expenditure is taking place. It tends to have a greater concern about inflation than unemployment. That is particularly evident at present and I will come back to this point in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It neglects the goal of equity. It seems to be entirely preoccupied with goals of efficiency, but goals of equity are also important. If one looks at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> one does not see any tables assessing equity or inequity in various countries. It is not an issue which is a central concern of the Organisation. There is a pervasive confidence in the efficiency of markets. The OECD frequently advocates deregulation, privatisation, corporatisation and so on, regardless of whether that is really the appropriate course of action to take, whether market failure is embedded in the area it is talking about and whether deregulation would simply lead to increased market failure and loss of efficiency rather than improvements in efficiency. Deregulation does not always lead to improvements in efficiency by any means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD tends to be quite sceptical of centralised wage fixing systems and argues against them. It favours the deregulation of labour markets. It has been pretty sceptical&mdash;although I must say not entirely&mdash;of incomes policy. A stream of thought amongst a minority of staff in the OECD has recognised the benefits of incomes policy. Of course, the Australian experience increases the attention that is given to incomes policy in the OECD because it has been so successful here. Nevertheless, the broad orientation of the Organisation has been scepticism of centralised wage fixing systems. It is generally opposed to government intervention in most ways in the economy. It is also sceptical of medium term growth strategies. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> from a couple of years ago said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OECD has followed the fashions of academic economics and of conservative policymaking and switched its attention to the supply side of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>In its various appraisals it typically urges governments to look for micro-economic measures to make markets work better. Two of its favourite themes are reduction of the role of government in the economy and the elimination of what it calls labour market rigidities, regardless of whether those rigidities are contributing to achieving the goals of income restraint which are so important in reducing inflation and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of the policies of the Organisation is contained in its report on Australia. Its report on Australia is really very disappointing because it emphasises policies which have been used overseas and, as I have said already, have caused such problems in Britain and the United States, regardless of whether that fits the institutional structure or the state of the Australian economy. An excellent article by Tim Colebatch from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> commented on this report on Australia. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like Federal Treasury, the OECD was once a broad church, but its economic perspective has narrowed markedly over the 1980s. Its mission now is to spread the orthodoxy of the textbooks: move to free markets as quickly as possible, minimise government ownership and regulation, keep monetary policy and fiscal policy tight, and decentralise wage bargaining . . . its policy recommendations differ little from those advanced by the Federal Opposition in its Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>So the OECD does, in effect, take a rather political stance although it would deny it is doing that. Colebatch concludes his article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seeing its patients' condition worsening, you might think the OECD would be reviewing its treatment. Instead, it is telling both countries to increase the dosage. We deserve better.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly true. `Both countries' refers to Australia and New Zealand; he also discusses the OECD report on New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that there is nothing of benefit in the report. A number of recommendations are of benefit. For example, it talks about the need to increase education spending and spending on training and research and development. It talks about the benefits that would have for economic growth in Australia. That is absolutely right. I am glad to say that the Government is increasing its spending on education, training and research and development in this Budget, but that process needs to go considerably further if we are going to have a skilled work force and the innovation that is required to make Australia as creative and competitive as we can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, many of the emphases of the OECD at present are overstated. Its preoccupation with the free market and its neglect of market failure are weaknesses, as is its lack of balance in achieving the goals of efficiency and equity. It is preoccupied with efficiency. That does matter; that is very important; but it needs to be balanced with a concern for equity. Reducing inflation is important; it does matter. Of course, countries would perform better with lower inflation rates. But that has to be balanced with a concern for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central concern of the OECD at present ought to be unemployment. Not only in this country but also throughout most of the OECD area&mdash;not, I am glad to say, in every country; Japan, Sweden and the Netherlands have lower unemployment, as countries which have an effective balance between the public and private sectors&mdash;and in many countries which are regarded by OECD economists as having adopted the policies that they would recommend, such as Britain and the United States, unemployment is high and is rising rapidly. So the OECD's central preoccupation at present should be unemployment. It should be putting a much more creative effort into the development of fresh policies which it could recommend in relation to unemployment. It does not do so in its report on Australia, for example, to nearly the extent that it should have done. If it does that we will all be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One interesting piece of research that it has generated shows that if the government of any member country increases its spending by $1, output will rise by $1.50 at home and by almost the same amount abroad, so that total OECD output expands by almost $3. An extra dollar here generates a total increase in output here and in other member countries totalling $3. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, if all countries reflate together, the increase in activity may be far greater than each had bargained for.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely that indicates the kind of strategy that the OECD should be recommending at present. Throughout the area unemployment is very high and in some cases disastrously high. If all member countries combined to reflate together, that unemployment problem would be significantly reduced. I am not saying it can be resolved simply by reflating, but that is the first and principal requirement to easing unemployment. That is what they should be concentrating on now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first and possibly the last Budget brought down by the Treasurer and honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), of which these Supply Bills are an integral part, is characterised by a deficit of $13.4 billion after asset sales of $1.6 billion. Direct funding is provided to local councils for job creation. The Government has thereby endeavoured to create a fiscal stimulus for the economy that will flow through rapidly for job creation projects. In doing so, the Government has predicted a modest growth rate of 3 per cent in GDP over the next 12 months. Even so, unemployment is estimated to average 10.5 per cent, compared to an average of 10.4 per cent for 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely any industrial development strategy to benefit the people of Australia should aim at lower unemployment, and decisions that preserve present jobs, as well as encouraging new enterprises, should be sought. This is particularly necessary if recent figures published in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 25 August 1992 are taken into consideration. The figures, based on the supplementary Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released on 24 August, found that 1,971,800 people&mdash;that is, 21.2 per cent of the work force aged 15 to 69&mdash;were unemployed and looking for work at some time in the year leading up to March of this year. The President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Merle Mitchell, commented that the figures were `closer to the real picture' and that the Council hoped the Government's Budget initiatives would help turn the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the rub, Mr Deputy Speaker. How do temporary job creation schemes organised by local councils for a year or two solve the intrinsic economic problems facing Australia? The solution to our chronic economic malaise clearly lies in the creation of real jobs in industry, which requires a determined affirmation of faith and action in the three main productive sectors of manufacturing, farming and mining. Not only do these three key industry sectors directly employ over one-fifth of the work force, but their buoyancy, or lack of it, heavily affects the level of activity and thus employment in the various services sectors. The naive notion presently abroad that Australia's future can be built on services alone while our manufacturing industry is left to fade away is an economic nonsense&mdash;a nonsense made obvious when attention is focused on how Australia's exports pay its way in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1990-91 mining and mineral processing contributed 37 per cent of exports; manufactures, 22 per cent; and agriculture, 21 per cent; while all services accounted for only 20 per cent. Moreover, total manufactured exports grew at an average annual rate of 10 per cent over the three years to 1991, with exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, such as motor vehicles, fabricated metal products and machinery and equipment, increasing by 20 to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the difficulties of preserving our manufacturing industries at the present time. Firstly, let me point out that, although the relative significance of manufacturing to our economy has decreased in the years following World War II, when encouraging manufacturing was a deliberate government policy, it is still a significant part of the Australian economy. It accounts for 17 per cent of GDP, which is well in excess of the combined output of agriculture and mining, which together account for 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very importantly at this time of crisis unemployment levels, manufacturing also remains a significant employer of labour, employing 15 per cent of Australia's labour force. Among the Australian Bureau of Statistics sectors of the economy, only wholesale and retail trade and community services employ more Australians than manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Michael Deeley, former Managing Director of ICI Australia Pty Ltd, summed the situation up very simply in a paper given to the Deakin Breakfast Club in my electorate on 23 April this year, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturing represents about a sixth of our economy. If we no longer produce manufactured goods, we are going to have to buy those goods from other countries and find jobs for people who no longer produce those goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Deeley agreed with the economic rationalists that our industry must achieve international competitiveness, but differed on the means of achieving it. Dr Deeley is joined in this opinion by an increasing number of people in academia, industry, business, government and the community who are questioning the sterile economic rationalist line perpetrated over the past decade. The incredible disasters that followed Labor's ineptly implemented financial deregulation are the most classic illustrations of the discrediting of this body of thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not even economic rationalists are admitting to being economic rationalists any longer, according to Mr Peter Apps of Northwood, New South Wales, in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 June this year. Mr Apps, while researching for his book on what he calls `policy stuff-ups of the 1980s', failed to find any economic rationalists in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, the Finance Department or the Industry Commission. Apparently all have disappeared, but there are instead creatures answering to the name of `pragmatic pro-market economists'&mdash;according to Mr Apps, the same bird, a different name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly the argument is being mounted that we in Australia must have some form of protection for our industry if we are to survive as a nation, and the protective measures need to be put into action very quickly. Closely linked to unemployment as our major problem, arguments continue to proliferate around interventionist versus free market industry policy. Perhaps the picture of industry in Australia is put more clearly in a chief executive briefing from the Metal Trades Industry Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For industry managements, working as never before to raise the level of their competitiveness, orders are harder to come by as costs go up and tariffs go down.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on, referring to members of the MTIA National Executive, who are themselves active managers of large and small businesses, the editor writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all, their objective will be not the ascendancy of one particular economic theory over another, but to arrive at a commonsense middle way which will produce the kind of business environment Australia needs in a rapidly changing, highly volatile and shrinking world.</PARA>
<PARA>Where do we go from here to encourage our steadily diminishing manufacturing base? Certainly we cannot afford as a nation to go back to the days of heavy protection of all industry. Our industries must be competitive in world terms. The shake-out of the mid-1980s was, to a degree, necessary. However, there must be a balance. It would appear that Australia is one of the few countries in the world, if not the only one, pursuing policies to achieve what some here call a level playing field, to the detriment of its industry base, particularly in the southern manufacturing cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a brilliant cartoon by Nicholson in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 10 August this year. The cartoon appeared on the day of the 150th birthday celebration of the City of Melbourne, symbolically during this year's particularly bleak mid-winter weather. The heading of the cartoon was `150 Years Later'. To a background of skyscrapers depicting modern Melbourne, a boat plied the Yarra River. The boat's name was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Rationalists,</EMPHASIS> and it contained a number of dark-suited gentlemen answering that description. The satirical comment from one of them appeared as a caption underneath the cartoon. `This is the place for a village', he said. For the thousands of people who have lost their jobs due to retrenchments, industry restructuring or business failures, it was a bitter joke. Anyone in this place familiar with the city which was once the manufacturing heart of Australia would understand fully its implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian manufacturers are currently burdened with a range of imposed costs which markedly affect their competitiveness. These include a range of taxes on business inputs, a number of which are imposed by State governments. They include payroll tax, wholesale tax and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a centralised industrial relations structure which has institutionalised outmoded work practices and inflated costs; for example, high penalty rates for weekend work and a 17 1/2 per cent loading on holiday pay. Australia is the only country in the world where people are paid more to go on holidays than they are to work normally. Fightback will go a long way towards reforming these particular practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we also have taxation structures relating to investments which are unattractive compared with those available in competing countries. In Australia we have a long history of higher inflation than other OECD countries, requiring more cash in working capital and reducing the real value of depreciated cash flows. Good progress has been made recently in reducing inflation, and it is to be hoped that these gains will remain stable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a considerably inferior anti-dumping regime compared with our competitors. At this stage I would like to spend some further time illustrating the dumping problem as it applies to some of our businesses. Mr Laurie Ford, the managing director of the Caford group of companies in Box Hill, Victoria, which is close to my electorate, thinks the performance of the Australian Customs Service could be much improved in respect of dumping. Caford is a family company which was started by Mr Ford's late father in the 1940s. It manufactures a range of products, including specialist metal and plastic castors for furniture, which were invented by Mr Ford's father. It is the major Australian castor producer; it is efficient and modern. But over the last few years it has seen the share of the local market supplied by domestic producers shrink to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 imports of castors, principally from Taiwan, at dumped prices supplied 25 per cent of the market. Now they have 80 per cent and the figure is still growing. Apart from Caford, there are only two small local producers left out of all the ones that existed previously. Like many other efficiently run businesses swamped by dumped imports, Caford has incurred heavy losses and has reduced its work force. It has subsequently had to refinance at high rates of interest. Yet, after three attempts, which started five years ago, to claim material injury from dumped imports, it has not been able to convince the ACS of the merits of its case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing legislation, which is now under review, the domestic producer must prove dumping. What is needed now is to shift the onus of proof from Australian producers to the importer. Dr Bill Weekes, Visiting Fellow of Management at the Faculty of Business at RMIT, commented on the Caford case. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">United States penalty rates of duty are imposed to support domestic producers claims until importers can prove their products are not being dumped.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade clearly states that you can restrict the quantity or value of imports to safeguard your external financial position and balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is about time that Australian policy makers did something to safeguard ours.</PARA>
<PARA>Although growing numbers of developed economies are widening their use of non-tariff barriers such as anti-dumping laws and standards testing to stymie competition, the tariff issue is still a very difficult one. The economic rationalist line of drastic reductions of tariffs, or even zero tariffs, is coming under more and more criticism from business people and the general public, particularly in manufacturing centres such as Melbourne. We hear any number of options from advocation of immediate tariff freeze for two years to zero tariffs by the year 2000. Professor Geoffrey Blainey, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Monthly</EMPHASIS> of January this year, put the point strongly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lower tariffs will initially bring more imports than we can pay for. The crisis in the balance of payments will be aggravated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995 the Federal Government, Liberal or Labor, will probably have to restore or increase some of the import duties. By then, hundreds of our factories will be closed . . . other nations will have the factories, we will have the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Gregory Clark of Sophie University, Tokyo, wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if Australia carries out all the reforms the rationalists want, it will still not be competitive&mdash;it will end up sacrificing its manufacturing sector and creating massive unemployment&mdash;for nothing.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Colin White, Senior Lecturer in Economic History at La Trobe University, wrote recently in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unhappily, all the evidence suggests that such a policy (of dismantling tariff barriers) has accelerated, if not initiated, a process of de-industrialisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robert Manne, senior lecturer in politics at La Trobe University and well-known editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> since 1989, believes that the economic rationalist experiment has failed. In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 29 August, he wrote in these compelling terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence of our economic failure is visible in every city and country town, in collapsing businesses, mounting unemployment and families in crisis. It is seen in the ruin of great institutions like the State Bank of Victoria which took a hundred years to build, three to destroy. It is in the billions squandered in constructing city skyscrapers that stand today like giant tombstones, empty; or in the building of dozens of luxury resorts. It is in the impoverishment of rural Australia, where farming families have been driven from land they have worked for many generations. It is in the overseas debt statistics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, let us not forget the most telling comment in the 1991 World Bank report on global economic prospects and the developing countries. One part of that report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twenty of the 24 OECD economies are, on balance, more protectionist now than they were 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, I draw the attention of the House to the growing number of regional trading blocs around the world&mdash;including the recently established North American group, NAFTA, about which we have had much debate in these last few days&mdash;the conversion of ASEAN into a trading bloc and the continuing barriers inherent in the European Economic Community. All of this, together with the current stalemate on the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, exacerbates our difficulties as a trading nation. It would seem that Australia's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. Above all, under a coalition government, industry will require certainty and commonsense in policy formulation and implementation in order to successfully play its part in rebuilding our country and in creating lasting jobs for Australians. </PARA>

He argues his beliefs and elicits some respect from those of us on this side of House for the fact that he does not give ground; he states his position. Having listened to the honourable member for Deakin, we hope that the shadow Minister at the table would listen to some of the arguments that have been put by one of his own backbenchers here today&mdash;arguments that perhaps suggest that the Opposition could reconsider its policy of advocating a zero tariff level for the car industry and many other industries. We on this side of the House believe that the Australian car industry will not survive if we have a zero tariff policy, as advocated by the conservative coalition. The number of people employed in Adelaide in electorates such as Makin would simply be decimated if the Opposition's policy of zero tariffs were ever applied in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, we have said that industry had to reform and get leaner and more efficient. In a package negotiated with the Australian car industry, this Government has reached agreement for a reduction in tariffs down to 15 per cent. But it is very clear that, if one does not have some tariff protection for Australia's car industry, it will not survive. The Australian car industry does not have the massive volume throughput that they have in America, Japan or Europe. Unless we offer some protection to the Australian car industry, it will perish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is very reassuring to hear a speech such as that made by the honourable member for Deakin from the Opposition side of this Parliament making it clear that within the Opposition a number of members are very concerned about the Opposition's zero tariff policy. If one read this morning's papers, one would have seen that a former Premier of South Australia&mdash;the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall)&mdash;has questioned the Opposition's wisdom in the way it has sold its policy of zero tariffs. I have to say it is pleasing to see that members of the Opposition are raising these issues in the privacy and confidence of their party room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important for Australia that we work out what is best for an industry as important as the motor vehicle industry.

Because Mr Johnston had the temerity to raise that one issue he was branded as a liar by the Leader of the Opposition. Toyota is a company which is investing over $750m in Australia in a new plant to be built I think in Altona in Victoria&mdash;a plant that will create a lot of jobs for Victoria, for Australia and for the Australian car industry. And for his efforts the general manager of Toyota Australia, Mr Bill Johnston, gets branded a liar by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

It is very clear what the outcome of that will be. It is very clear that companies such as Mitsubishi, Toyota and Ford simply will not be investing money in the Australian car industry. </PARA>

The Opposition is saying we should have absolute free trade in motor vehicles between Australia and the United States, Australia and Canada, Australia and Mexico. What would be left of the Australian car industry if the Opposition policy were implemented? I will tell honourable members what would be left: we would have a Commodore designed in Detroit and made in Mexico. We would have a badge with the name `Commodore' placed on a car that was designed in the United States and made in Mexico, and very few Australians would be working in the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that the Opposition is running around with a proposal that we should have free trade with North America. It is very clear that the United States Secretary of Trade believes that this free trade area should be extended to the entire Americas&mdash;North and South America.

If people drive a Ferrari or own a Rolls or a four-wheel drive Toyota it does not really matter much to them if Australians lose their jobs making Magnas, Commodores and all the other vehicles made in Australia, because they are only used to a Ferrari or a Rolls or a Mercedes or something like that. </PARA>

The day after the Budget we had the Leader of the Opposition and shadow Ministers saying that the Government was wrong to increase government spending and that the Government was wrong to provide a fiscal stimulus to give the economy a kick-start. Their knee-jerk reaction, as reflected in the grab that was put out on radio and television, was to say that this was increased government spending clocked up on Bankcard. I think that was the 20- or 15-second grab, whatever it is down to now, that the Opposition gave to the media. It said that this is extra government spending on Bankcard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mitchell agrees, along with the shadow Minister at the table. The then shadow Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition, criticised us for reducing interest rates back in January 1990. Honourable members opposite criticised us every time there was a reduction in interest rates. Had their policies been implemented, the economy would have been in a bigger recession. Certainly there would be no way we would be in a recovery, because today the Opposition is still arguing that one does not give the economy a kick-start; one applies the brakes even harder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy as outlined in Fightback says that one does not provide a kick-start to the economy by increasing government expenditure in an intelligent way; it says that government expenditure should be cut back by another $3 billion. So at the very time the economy needs a kick-start, the Opposition says, `Put the brakes on as hard as you can'. It is absolutely economically illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it worse, Fightback then says that, the brakes having been put on in the first year by reducing government spending by $3 billion, one then applies a GST which blows inflation out. Interest rates will have to go through the roof. In that year, in year two of Fightback, it then provides a massive fiscal stimulus. At the very time inflation will be getting out of control the Opposition says one should then provide a fiscal stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous that the Opposition does not realise that its policy is to slam on the brakes at a time when we are trying to get the recovery going. It would put on a GST, blow out inflation and interest rates and then provide a fiscal stimulus, about two years too late. I am amazed that some of those opposite, probably with more economic degrees behind them than me, would argue something that even the honourable member for Mitchell, who I am sure has read R.J. Brown's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student Economics</EMPHASIS>, would understand is the opposite of what should be done at a time like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement and in the Budget, this Government announced national projects in rail, road and local capital works programs that will provide jobs and provide the kick-start that businesses need. The Opposition's response is: `We don't think the Government should spend any more money. We don't think the Government should give the economy a kick-start. Our view is that the Government should sit on its hands and do nothing until we get elected and we put on a 15 per cent consumption tax. That will solve everyone's problems'. Blowing out inflation and blowing out interest rates is a recipe for disaster for this country, especially for Australians who are looking for the economic recovery to gather strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minutes that remain I cannot let the opportunity go past without examining, once again, the Opposition's proposal, its economic solution, its alternative: the consumption tax. Opposition members argue that this is the miracle cure for Australia's economic ills; this is the miracle cure that will solve all our problems. It will abolish a number of taxes and pay for it by imposing a 15 per cent consumption tax on food and clothing, bread and milk&mdash;the necessities of life&mdash;telephone bills and parts of council rates. We do not know how much of the council rates will be subject to the tax, but, at the very least, it will apply to garbage services and to water and sewerage if they are provided by the council. A 15 per cent tax will be applied to restaurant bills and food from takeaway milk bars. You name it, it will be slugged by the 15 per cent consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members say, `Don't worry, we're going to abolish wholesale sales tax. The prices won't actually go up 15 per cent; they will go up somewhere between 4 per cent and 8 per cent, or 15 per cent. But don't worry because by abolishing wholesale sales tax it won't be as bad as it sounds. Don't worry, it won't quite be 15; it will be a bit less than 15'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When similar proposals have been brought in in New Zealand and Canada, the prices of those products that should be cheaper when the sales tax is abolished have never fallen. The prices of those products where the consumption tax forces the price to go up by the maximum amount actually go up by the maximum amount. We have no mechanism for forcing retailers to pass on the reductions that should be there through the abolition of wholesale sales tax. I will bet all those retailers will make sure the prices go up by the full 15 per cent on things such as bread and milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it hard to understand how the Opposition can argue that its system will be fairer when we have a system today,  under the wholesale sales tax regime, in which the necessities of life, such as food and clothing, are not taxed.

I can tell the honourable member for Mitchell that the battlers in his electorate who are watching this debate today, and those who will read it later, probably cannot afford to put in a swimming pool, but I bet they can afford to buy bread and milk. That is why it is ridiculous to hit swimming pools at 15 per cent and bread and milk at the same rate. A wholesale sales tax that varies the rate according to whether an item is a necessity or a luxury is the right way to go. It is much fairer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a much more efficient way to collect the tax, because wholesale sales tax is collected at the wholesale level. Who is going to collect the consumption tax the Opposition is putting forward? Every retailer and every person in every factory. Every person who adds value to any product anywhere in the country will have to fill out pieces of paper. We know that there will have to be an extra 1,000 people in the Tax Office to process these bits of paper. Opposition members are trying to tell us that this will be a help to small business. Then they say, `Don't worry, small business, we'll abolish payroll tax. That will be a big boost for you'. The only problem is that most small businesses do not pay payroll tax. Most small businesses earn less than the threshold to pay payroll tax. </PARA>

The corner store does not pay payroll tax; Grace Bros does. To remove payroll tax is to remove the competitive advantage that the small businessman has. That is why I find it so hard to  understand why the party of free enterprise is trying to force small business to fill out endless pieces of paper&mdash;more bureaucracy&mdash;and to remove the competitive advantage that small business has over the large retailers by abolishing payroll tax.

Then, hidden in the fine print, there is the imposition of a road user charge. They will not tell us how much that will be. It is a recipe for disaster. They do not understand that what the economy needs now is a kick-start, as this Government has proposed.

It has created one million unemployed people and increased the level of family break-ups.

It is a dreadful situation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is content to deal with the Packers, the Bonds, the Sir Peter Abeles and the ACTU and forget the rest of us. That is not the way to run a country. The country is the people. That is why the Government lacks vision. It has no thoughts for the people. It has no vision; it has no plans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of confidence in the average Aussie, who is well educated and well informed. Australians are goers, they like to see a challenge, and they like to solve problems. But they are not offered any opportunities by this Government. All the Government offers in this Budget and the Supply Bills that we are debating today is that it will take more money from those who are working. The Government is running up the debt, and we all the pay interest rates on the money the Government is borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is creating programs to help people who are unemployed&mdash;unemployment created by itself and its policies. It has more money out on all sorts of projects, basically so that it can say, `We care about people'. That is not the way to produce solutions. Australians need incentive and want a fair go. The Government is not prepared to give them a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are saying that families with children need greater support because they are facing difficulties. Australians feel that those in retirement or facing retirement deserve a fair go and a predictable future. The Government is not prepared to give them a go. It is also felt that small and medium size businesses deserve a fair go so that they can feel a challenge and a future and in that way create more business and more jobs. Australians feel that the Government's migration program is hopeless. The Government has opened to the world Australia's welfare policies and for 10 years it has conducted an immigration program that is an absolute shambles. The Aussies are saying that we need more incentive, that families with children need a go, that the elderly deserve a chance, that small businesses need to have a chance to employ, and that the Government needs to do something about immigration because people are sick of the way the system is operating. </PARA>

The Government is going for 23,000 jobs, which will all be paid for by those who are in work or will be put on tick.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has taken the unemployment problem completely out of the context of what is happening with bankruptcies and the closures. It has taken it out of the context of family circumstances where there is trauma and distress. It has taken it out of context of the education system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various aspects of the desires and aspirations of Australians have to be dealt with. Australians have to be offered a chance. Most Aussies think that if the Government let them have more of their own money back, instead of taking so much, that would be an incentive for day-to-day living. The Government has not looked at what will give people an incentive to do more, to produce more, to work more, to work smarter and use their talents. The Government has felt that it is better to lock all of that up with the ACTU. Martin Ferguson then gains prestige and position as king of that heap, but it has no benefit for the average worker. The deals have been done but the results are not beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needs to reduce personal income tax. A 30 per cent cut to begin with would be about right. That is what the Opposition is proposing in Fightback. We will supply incentive to the average workers by cutting their tax. We will get out of their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a look at how New Zealand has reorganised its workplace relationships. It is interesting because Martin Ferguson and previous speakers have said, `Well, if you let the employer and the employee actually get together and negotiate what is reasonable, wages will fall'. They have done that in New Zealand. Ninety-two per cent of wages have stayed the same or have increased. In Australia we have the shackles of set smokos, set rostered days off, set overtime, penalty rates and all the rest of it. In New Zealand the workers have scrapped all of that junk and have said, `We want to work harder. We want to get this company or little business going'. They are getting more money from that process. They are not on the never-never for some training scheme or superannuation scheme run by the union movement. They have got down and sorted it out for themselves, right there where they were. Australians need an incentive to know that their work is valued and that they are being paid for their work. That is what Fightback offers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families with children who are dependent on the income of one main breadwinner and supplemented by another income need incentive too. Of course, reduced taxation is of great assistance to those families. But their expenses need to be acknowledged. The expenses they incur with children should be acknowledged by increasing the spouse allowance. Money for family allowances should be doubled. That has been thought of by the Opposition and is contained in Fightback. We will take care of families and give them a balanced approach. They are the group in Australia that is penalised at the moment. They are the group where there is trauma and break-up because they cannot manage their finances. They are saying, `There is not enough to go around, we cannot pay the house off, we cannot keep up rental payments. The cost of living is going up, the standard of living has fallen and we do not know how to manage our personal affairs'. That is what is happening in Australia today. But the Government does not acknowledge that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need support for families with children. The Government has not even given any attention to the families of Australia. There was not one word in the Budget Speech about Australian families. The Government is prepared to let them rot, go to the wall and lose their jobs. It is prepared to let them lose their houses and downgrade their standard of living. The Government does deals with Martin Ferguson and leaves families off its Budget agenda altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the elderly? The Government has made eight changes to superannuation retirement benefits over the past six or seven years, and people are at a loss to know where they stand. They do not know where they are going; they do not know how to prepare for their future. All their lives people have been planning and setting aside funds or making arrangements for their retirement, and the Government comes along and makes change after change after change. People have been penalised by the Government taking more and more of their funds and they feel insecure about their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has thought about this matter. We feel that the first thing a person should get on retirement is access to a pharmaceutical benefits card. We think that people need to be sure about their health requirements in retirement. We have said that those people should have that pharmaceutical benefits card so they can feel certain that their health needs will be attended to. After that, there is the issue of entitlement to funds, and people are run through a whole series of tests to find out whether they have income, assets or whatever, but the first requirement is a consideration of their health needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also proposed a 30 per cent reduction in personal income tax for people who are living on their savings. We will pay compensation if there is an increase in costs. We will increase pensions and benefits by 8 per cent, which is double what the Treasury calculates the impact of a goods and services tax will be. Our increase is to make sure that people are properly compensated and so there can be no argument that the Government is dudding them. It is double the amount predicted in the price increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also compensation for people who have savings. A one-off cheque will be sent to them to top up their savings, because the value of their savings has been slightly diminished by the introduction of a goods and services tax. When that is put together with a superannuation package that gives incentive and taxation relief to people who are superannuating, when we remove the lump sum tax and make provisions for people to take part of their superannuation in a lump sum and some as annuity to be put in roll-over funds, there is greater certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is building a program for the next 10 or 20 years. It is not a prop-up process, which is what the Government is into.

Australians are the people that make this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that we on this side of the House are proud of the fact that Australia's living standard has dropped from the highest in the world at the beginning of this century to No. 23 or 24. In the last three years, its placing has dropped from 17 to 23. That is where we are going. This Government has created that and now it is trying to so fudge the issue that it does not take any responsibility for its actions. It is blaming everybody else and saying, `Yes, but we can introduce these expenditure programs, sell Qantas and take the proceeds of the sale of that wonderful corporation and turn it into job creation programs'. One billion dollars would be put to no use. It does not retire debt. I acknowledge that it helps those who are unemployed, but there are better ways and more successful ways of helping people who are unemployed than selling Qantas. Once sold, that one big asset cannot be recovered, nor can the funds from it be recovered. Australia is not getting any permanent benefit by the proceeds of this sale, whereas to retire some of the debt that the Government has chalked up would have a long lasting and permanent effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the small businesses of Australia? They are the big job creators. The Government has got them for this tax, that tax and 101 other taxes. We in the Opposition are going to take seven taxes off them. We are going to say, `You ought to have a fair go, because you are going to create the jobs'. That is where incentive comes from. If people can be offered jobs, at least they can make a living. They do not have the prospect that 30 or 40 per cent of our school leavers have at the moment of going onto the unemployment queues. Once they get on the unemployment queue, the Government starts a job creation program to train them a bit more to stay unemployed for another period. That is no vision. That is not a future for Australia. That does not offer us a prospect. The Government is just managing a crisis, it is not giving us solutions. There need to be solutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Budget. It is a very important Budget. As a Labor representative&mdash;and particularly as the honourable member for Chifley&mdash;I often listen to people commenting about what Ben Chifley's reaction would have been to this or that matter. It seems to me that this Budget has been framed from a traditional Labor perspective; that is, there are certainly measures to assist pensioners, in terms of the increases that they have received; there are infrastructure proposals; and there are further measures to train those who are unemployed. These are all very traditional Labor Party things, and I am very pleased to be associated with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, we certainly have a significant problem with unemployment. The general rate of unemployment for the March quarter in the Blacktown local government area was 13.9 per cent, which is well above the State and national averages.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me is youth unemployment. I must confess to the House some frustration in this aspect. Getting the Blacktown figures alone is impossible as they are aggregated with Baulkham Hills, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that our general rate was 13.9 per cent. The  figure for Baulkham Hills, incidentally, has shot up to 3.5 per cent. But when it comes to the full time rate of youth unemployment for the two local government areas, the figure is 43.1 per cent. This is bad enough, but I suspect that the figures are significantly understated. It is only natural when government programs are put in to assist people that this understatement of the youth unemployment rate in my electorate causes concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should qualify those figures. When measuring the youth unemployment rate, we take out, of course, all of those students who are in years 11 and 12, or who are undertaking a university or TAFE course. It is the unemployment rate amongst the residual population. Be that as it may, we need to have reliable statistics and, in this instance, I do not have any. I must confess my bitter disappointment, after having written to the Australian Statistician of the ABS, at having got a reply that is totally unsatisfactory. Whilst I agree that there are always going to be difficulties aggregating different local government areas, it is absolutely critical that the figures are by and large similar. I think the demographics of the Baulkham Hills local government area are dramatically different from the demographics of Blacktown, and the figures severely understate the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having raised this issue of youth unemployment, I think it is important that I mention the youth summit. I am very pleased to say that by and large the summit that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called here in Canberra went particularly well. Rather than politicians being seen to be completely unresponsive, I saw the exercise as being one in which the Government could listen to a variety of different people who were brought together to make their contribution as to how we might overcome the difficulties of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that summit, the Government made a major announcement. We should bear in mind that prior to the youth summit the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), in negotiations with the States, had already allocated some $700m towards bolstering TAFE. I have in my electorate a very large college, namely, the Mount Druitt TAFE. By and large in the western suburbs of Sydney the take up rate for TAFE courses is high, which is all for the better. So a government commitment that pours in Australia-wide an extra $700m is indeed good news for my area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth summit initiatives related to more than just TAFE. A further 12,000 pre-vocational places are to be created in TAFE for 1993. The pre-vocational courses that were run at Mount Druitt and in Blacktown were highly successful. They were only discontinued when&mdash;and this was not so long ago&mdash;record places in apprenticeships and traineeships were being achieved. Pre-vocational courses are an anti-cyclical measure and it is most appropriate that we should be introducing them at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt that the most exciting thing in the youth summit announcements by the Prime Minister was this Government's commitment to the Carmichael report. I remain an unabashed fan of what will be revolutionary changes for young Australians in what will be offered to them in years 11 and 12 in terms of vocational courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this Parliament many times that, unfortunately, whilst we can take a great deal of pride in the dramatic increase in retention rates in years 11 and 12 from about 33 per cent to 70 per cent, it remains a disappointment that the majority of young Australians&mdash;some 60 per cent of those attending years 11 and 12&mdash;are offered courses which do not really meet their needs and aspirations, which are very legitimate. They aspire to enter the world of work and see those senior years as preparing them for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report advocated a number of initiatives. In summary, it believes there should be a commitment to senior high schools or secondary colleges. I regret to say that I cannot see that particular recommendation being picked up at this time. However, the report believes that vocational courses should be offered to these young Australians, which they may undertake at school or at TAFE or at a combination of schools and TAFE. Carmichael also says that these courses ought to be rigorous, challenging and demanding, that they should be certified and esteemed. Most important of all, Carmichael suggests that we need to involve industry or business and that a significant part of this training will be carried out on the shop floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also advocates the collapsing of apprenticeships and traineeships, the modulising of these apprenticeships and traineeships and the rapid expansion in the number of occupations that are covered. These Carmichael changes will be very revolutionary and will point the way for young Australians in the 1990s and beyond the year 2000. We will wonder why we did not adopt them earlier. A figure of approximately $100m has been allocated to the Australian vocational certificate and $53m over three years to get pilot projects and new Career Start traineeships under way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an electorate such as mine, and in particular in the western suburbs of Sydney, these changes will be profound and they will benefit young people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased that Laurie Carmichael visited my electorate. I regret that the latest version of the Trotskyites took a great deal of interest at the meeting,  I suppose to everyone's discomfort and displeasure. But it is important that Laurie should go around the country preaching the message about the Carmichael report. I sincerely hope that in this aspect of the Budget we would have bipartisan support, because young Australians are certainly deserving of the Parliament's consideration in a non-political way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects in the youth summit statement that will benefit young people who are unemployed. These include giving them six months training, Jobstart at the end of that, developing new Career Start traineeships and the expansion of Skillshare and Jobtrain. In my electorate I have a number of Skillshare programs, including the Sydney City Mission at Mount Druitt and the Holy Family program at Emerton. Unfortunately, I have lost one of the two Mamre Plains Skillshare projects to my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), but I know he will value the good work that is carried out there. There is one at Blacktown and one at North St Marys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record that every time I have visited these programs and spoken to the participants, they are all very grateful for the opportunity to learn new skills and better prepare themselves for the world of work. I am delighted at the success rates. They either lead people to  seek employment or, more particularly, they equip individuals to undertake some more formal courses that may be available at TAFE, which possibly they would never have had the confidence or ability to tackle. Perhaps I have said enough on the youth statement, but in an electorate such as mine it has been important for so many young talented Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having served in local government, I want to talk about one of the initiatives that I am particularly pleased about, and that is the local government capital works program. As the House will be aware, the Government is spending some $345m on the initiative of the previous Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), and it is a very worthwhile initiative for local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often in this Parliament we hear criticism of mickey mouse government programs that will not benefit anyone. The city of Blacktown will benefit from this program to the tune of $7 1/2m. It was enthusiastically received by the local council and aldermen and very enthusiastically received by the people. As is sometimes difficult with Federal programs, people could actually see a measure targeted to the local area. These programs that the council has developed are widespread and involve, for example, the construction of a bridge at Power Street at a cost, from memory, of $1.6m. This bridge is very close to an industrial site and industries wishing to locate there have pointed out that the lack of a bridge is a weakness, so it is an infrastructure project that has direct economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another allocation is $500,000 towards an Aboriginal cultural centre at Nurragingy Reserve, and indeed Power Street runs through the reserve. This is a 90-hectare program where the Federal Government previously had committed some $3m to developing an outstanding regional passive recreation area for the city of Blacktown but with regional significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through Danny Eastwood, the Aboriginal artist of the year, the Gamilaroi Dance Troupe has been involved and quite a number of other Aboriginal community members have come up with the idea, which they have worked through with council, of developing an Aboriginal cultural centre where tourists and local residents can see the Gamilaroi Dance Troupe actually performing. There would be an arts and craft centre associated with it and, apart from its construction, its objective would be to make the centre a fully commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Lest some honourable members suspect that we are sticking this project out in the middle of nowhere and have no chance of attracting any tourists, I might say that it is located a couple of kilometres away from Featherdale. Featherdale is a natural animal reserve in Doonside which attracts some 900,000 paying customers every year, 350,000 of whom are Japanese tourists. It is a complementary development, and I am frankly very excited. I must congratulate not only Danny and the team, who had the vision for it, but also Blacktown City Council, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the councillors of ATSIC on the very positive way that they have responded and are considering the proposal. I am looking forward to the day when we actually get it going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has allocated out of its local government capital works program $500,000 towards this project. In a normal year, there would probably be&mdash;and I mean no disrespect&mdash;a riot amongst the aldermen if so large a sum were allocated out of their normal capital works program for such a project. The Council is speaking as a community in allocating this money, but it is able to do so only because of the initiative within this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is an absolute shame that the Liberal Party in my State appears to be out to destroy this local government capital works program. I find the comments of the Minister for Local Government, Mr Peacocke, absolutely reprehensible in threatening local government that he is going to hold up the money that is going towards these very worthwhile projects. In effect, in a project aimed at stimulating the local economy, providing infrastructure and providing jobs for those who are unemployed, he is directing pain and anguish at those who are least able to bear it. This program overcomes many of the objections that have been raised&mdash;not always accepted by the Opposition&mdash;about previous programs. This program is devoid of objections. It has the support and enthusiasm of local government, but the Liberal Party in my State is saying `No, we are going to take the opportunity to hold them up'. I think in the city of Blacktown, voters in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) and my own electorate have 7 1/2 million reasons why at the next election they ought not to vote for the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me if I did not mention some aspects of the defence budget. I apologise that I have little time, but I must say from my own responsibilities that I am delighted that the Government has been able to preserve intact our major capital equipment procurement program. It is valued at over $2,300m this year, in contrast to the paltry $476m in 1982-83. If one wanted to calculate it in constant dollars for the previous year, it is about $1,450m. So this Government has made a major commitment to equipping the armed forces so that they have the capability of defending this country. The easiest thing for governments to do is to cut the capital equipment procurement program and keep the manpower on, thus making huge savings but at the extreme price of undermining the capability of the armed services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have announced an extensive new program. The total new investments announced in this Budget total some $916m, not all of which will be spent. The major elements of that are the P3C Orion updates, the Boeing 707 simulator, the naval communications station, the FA18 radar evaluation facility and, probably the biggest of all, the coastal minehunter program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that we have continued our commitment to the major capital works and our commitment to industry whereby about 70 per cent of these dollars stay in Australia and 30 per cent go overseas, whereas the ratio of the previous Government was quite the reverse: about 30 per cent stayed in Australia and 70 per cent went overseas. My role is to increase those percentages. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This report will be tabled in the Parliament next Monday. Unfortunately, in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> there appeared an article on page 3 entitled `Call for Chinese students to lose special status' by Margaret Easterbrook.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article was considered at a meeting of the Committee held today and in the opinion of the Committee it constitutes a breach of privilege of the most serious kind. I was instructed by the Committee at that meeting to raise with you what action can be taken in relation to this matter. This article has created considerable angst and confusion in the Chinese community which is, to say the least, unfortunate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for raising the matter. Under standing order 95 the honourable member has an obligation, if he believes that a matter of privilege has arisen, to raise it at the first opportunity; he has done that. In September 1990 the Speaker outlined the procedures to be followed in such cases, and I will outline these to the honourable member because the Speaker also reminded the House of these procedures on 7 May this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House should be informed at the first opportunity; so the honourable member has met that obligation. The Joint Committee itself, which is the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, will now need to give further consideration to the issue, in particular the need to do two things: the first is to consider whether there has been substantial interference with its work, with the committee system or with the functions of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After your performance the other night I would shut up, if I were you. The end point nominal tariff for cars at 15 per cent in 1997 is an effective rate of 36 per cent. The current effective rate is 113 per cent and it was 243 per cent. The Opposition is proposing to take what was an effective rate of 243 per cent in 1988 to zero. The effective rate of 36 per cent which would obtain from a nominal rate of 15 per cent would, of course, be abolished. I noticed a report in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> today concerning the shadow spokesman on industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker.

<PARA>In other words, he is not disputing that it would be highly unlikely. On radio this morning the honourable member was questioned by Pru Goward, who said:</PARA>

<PARA>The honourable member replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, that is what he told me.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is one of the key motor vehicle industries of South Australia with an investment of $600m&mdash;a major investment in world terms&mdash;about to go into this city, Adelaide, and this State, South Australia, and the honourable member says that he accepts that the investment is highly unlikely.</PARA>

Too right it will be a tragedy if you are wrong. How would they expect an industry to come from a 243 per cent effective rate of protection to nothing and have it survive, and then try to induce a $600m investment by one of the world's major companies, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan&mdash;that is, have the Australian company seek $600m of investment from the parent company?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy would simply put asunder the future of the South Australian motor industry. What is more, the honourable member for Barker has admitted that it is highly unlikely that the investment would go ahead and that it would be a tragedy if it did not.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said in the Parliament on a number of occasions that governments and parliaments should be the supreme and accountable bodies to the public of Australia and that the right balance exists between the powers of the Reserve Bank under its legislation and the prerogatives of the government. That is an appropriate balance between the prerogatives of the government and the rights and entitlements of the Reserve Bank board. I have said that the existing arrangements work well, that the Reserve Bank Act is crafted well to encourage the board and the government to agree, and that price stability and full employment are the dual objectives. They were well constructed when the Act was written and they remain well constructed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that view, we have had a view put by the Opposition that the Reserve Bank is not independent, that it is politically manipulated, as the Leader of the Opposition has said. In his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document on page 38 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also legislate to give the Reserve Bank effective independence and a clear mandate to achieve medium term price stability.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of full employment&mdash;just medium term price stability with a clear legislative mandate for effective independence. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But all changes to monetary policy will be decided by the Bank Board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not by the government and the bank board. That is in the official document. He went on to say, in remarks, that I am attacking the issue of the Reserve Bank, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discovered a very interesting article in the economic papers of the Economic Society of Australia and New Zealand, published in February 1980. There is a long piece&mdash;18 pages&mdash;by the Leader of the Opposition about the Reserve Bank, its independence and its charter. It makes very interesting reading because if ever the charge `erratic' could stick, it will stick here. The article is unbelievable. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In simple terms, it needs to be decided whether such an institution would be undemocratic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, an independent central bank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it realistic or tolerable to contemplate the establishment of an independent central bank in a parliamentary democracy as exists in Australia? However, I would suggest that a fully independent central bank would be inconsistent with our system of parliamentary democracy. At the risk of oversimplification and idealism, the fundamental concepts of our system are those of accountability and responsibility. The Parliament is elected and is responsible to the people. The Executive Government is responsible to the people. The essence of this process is that responsibility and authority go together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, it would seem to be intolerable to establish an organisation to conduct monetary policy whereby such control could be vested in the hands of a few people, who would not be subject to supervision by either government or parliament, and who would need to take no account of the views of the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I doubt whether making such an institution free of political control would necessarily depoliticise that institution.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To summarise, as the elected government must bear the ultimate responsibility for economic policy formulation and execution, the central bank should, in the limit, be subservient to governments.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no talk about independence; there is no talk about Reserve Bank charters and there is no talk about legislation. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot seriously contemplate a situation where the Bank could set out to negate the economic policies that have been settled on by the government and/or the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me read some of the pearls in the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To conclude, I feel that it would be difficult to improve upon the drafting of the existing sections of the Reserve Bank Act dealing with the Bank's relations.</PARA>
<PARA>Talk about erratic! Talk about immature! It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a statement of principle, they are adequate. The key thing is how they work in practice and, at this level, the relationship seems, on the whole, to have worked reasonably well. There are a few examples of the Bank having "gone off on its own track" for extended periods. The Bank has generally accepted that the Government carried ultimate responsibility for economic policy formulation and execution and seems to have generally established a reasonable and helpful working relationship with successive governments.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no change in the constitutional arrangements since then and, if anything has happened since then, by moving to a quantity-based system with the float, the bank has more institutional independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, still, the Leader of the Opposition wrote this in a careful and serious way for a major book on papers, an 18-page printed document. During his period as adviser he wrote this and then he went on with the bile against Bernie Fraser while proposing that Mr Tim Marcus Clark might be the Governor of the Reserve Bank; that is, the career bureaucrat I had never met before I became a Minister&mdash;he was recommended to me by Mr Stone, was supported by Mr Howard for appointment as Secretary to the Treasury and was properly appointed as Governor of the Reserve Bank&mdash;has been berated, attacked and politicised by you while you propose the likes of Tim Marcus Clark to replace him. What a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, when you talk about giving the Reserve Bank independence, a right to construct monetary policy absolutely and alone without reference to the Government, and when you simply turn over all of the sensible tenets reflecting every view I have put in this place, and that the Governor has put in his remarks&mdash;every sensible view existing around the current Reserve Bank Act&mdash;what do you do? You simply make a cheap political point, saying that the Reserve Bank has been manipulating interest rates. The whole of the Fightback policy is constructed basically on a policy that the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in, a policy which at earlier stages he said had worked well with an appropriate balance between the bank and the Government where the elected people of Australia should have authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the erratic, immature behaviour of a person who has known better and will now do anything to attract attention, anything to be different, anything to be malicious. That is why Australian business, that is why the Treasury, that is why the Reserve Bank and all these people take no notice of him. They regard him as an extremist but most of all regard him as irrelevant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there would be common agreement across this House, as indeed across the whole country, that far and away the most important problem that faces Australia at the present time and far and away the most important political and economic challenge facing all of the men and women that represent the people of Australia in this Parliament is the issue of the parlously high level of unemployment in Australia at the present time. Every single issue that we discuss in this Parliament and every single debate that we engage in in this Parliament ought to be related back to what contribution it might make to a solution to Australia's unemployment problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few weeks, and most intensively over the past two days, this Parliament and the media of this country have been subjected to a debate about the issue of tariff protection. Tariff protection is of course an age old debate in Australia. It is always easy to run an emotional debate about tariff protection at a time of high unemployment. We have high unemployment at the present time and of course the Government is going for broke on the issue of tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I address the matter of public importance which is before the House, I want to take a moment to say something about the absolute humbug and hypocrisy of this Government with regard to tariff protection. The simple, unassailable fact is that when it comes to the pure issue of tariff policy there is no difference between the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. It is an absolute travesty by that master of misrepresentation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for him to parade around this country and this Parliament and say that the Government's policy on tariffs is over here and that our policy on tariffs is miles away on the other side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy on motor vehicles, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has pointed out on numerous occasions, is a tariff of up to 5 per cent by the year 2000. The Government's policy is 15 per cent. Does anybody who understands anything about the functioning of the Australian economy, and most particularly the man who was Treasurer when the Australian dollar was floated and this country embraced a floating exchange rate, deny that in an era of floating exchange rates the difference between 5 per cent and 15 per cent is absolutely immaterial? For all practical purposes, they know, he knows and anybody who understands the way the Australian economy operates ought to know that there is absolutely no difference of substance in any way, shape or form between the tariff policy of the Government and the tariff policy of the Opposition so far as a pure comparison of our attitude towards tariffs is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, one overwhelming difference when we look at the totality of our approach to this issue: unlike the Government, we are going to rip away billions of dollars of costs that burden Australian business and Australian industry through the introduction of our Fightback package. We are saying to the manufacturers of Australia, `Yes, you will have negligible tariff levels by the year 2000, but years before that you will have benefited to the tune of billions of dollars of removal of your cost burdens'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us have none of this puerile humbug from the Prime Minister, puerile humbug from Senator Button, and puerile humbug from some of their acolytes in the Australian media about there being some chasm between the Government and the Opposition on the pure question of tariffs, because if people believe that the Opposition's tariff policy is one of negligible levels by the year 2000, they must also believe the same thing of the Government in an environment of floating exchange rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is no stranger to the art of misrepresentation; he is no stranger to deliberately distorting the facts in an argument; he is no stranger to sweeping aside the relevance of fact and the relevance of truth when it comes to confronting a political or economic issue in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the matter of public importance&mdash;that is, employment&mdash;we had another example in Question Time today. The Prime Minister actually stood there at the despatch box and said that, unlike other countries, the Australian Labor Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track. They were his words: unlike other nations, we do not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at those other countries. I think that, if most Australians were asked to compare our economy with four other nations, they would instinctively say America, Japan, Britain and Germany. Others might have a different mix, but I think the majority of Australians, when they think of international comparisons, would still probably grab those four countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should remember that, unlike the rest of the world, we do not use the unemployed as a buffer; we are pure; we reach out, put an arm around them, bring them forward, look after them and are compassionate towards them. What is the unemployment level in Japan? It is 2.1 per cent. What is the unemployment level in the United States? It is 7.2 per cent. What is the unemployment level in Germany? It is 6.8 per cent. What is the unemployment rate in the dreaded Thatcherite Britain, that scorched earth relic of all these terrible policies that they inveigle against? The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is 9.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, we, the nation of Australia, whose Government does not use the unemployed as a buffer at the end of the railway track, have a lamentably worse unemployment record than countries such as Germany and Japan, a markedly worse unemployment level than the United Kingdom and a dramatically worse unemployment level than the United States. If we look at the scale of world comparison, we see that the Prime Minister of this country is the world's greatest disemployer. He really takes the cake, the prize, for having put more people out of work, comparatively, than any other country with which it is reasonable to compare the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who is sitting opposite me, can talk all he likes about participation rates, he can talk all he likes about those sorts of comparisons, just as I can talk all I like about the number of unemployed people in Australia. Those of us who represent Australians in this place would know quite well that, as well as the 11.1 per cent of our fellow country men and women who cannot get a job, there are probably another 8 or 9 per cent who are working a two-day week, a three-day week or a four-day week as an alternative to losing their jobs. So the true unemployment and under-employment rate in this country is probably around 20 per cent, or one in five. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the measure of the despair, and that is the measure of the achievement of this disemploying Prime Minister. This is the man who takes the prize as the great disemployer of the 1990s; this is the man who will use the legitimate fear of those people to stir up an emotive argument on the issue of tariff protection. I know that the issue of tariff protection is capable of emotional distortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Prime Minister that when we made announcements on tariff changes in 1988 he had the support of the Opposition. We did not play politics with the issue, as the Government shamefully is at present, to its great condemnation. It is playing blatant politics with the issue. It is distorting the situation because it is trying to divert attention away from its total failure on the issue of unemployment. The Government is trying to take the focus of the Australian people away from the fact that a Labor Government of almost 10 years standing has presided over the worst unemployment level in this nation since the years of the Great Depression. That is something&mdash;and the Minister who is at the table, is probably quite proud of this&mdash;that would make Labor predecessors such as Curtin and Chifley spin in their graves. It is an achievement of which anybody who is dedicated to the interests of working men and women in this country would be absolutely ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than confront it; rather than try to debate the issue in an intelligent fashion; rather than try to explain to the House why it is that 180,000 people in the private sector have lost their jobs over the last 12 months; rather than try to explain to the Australian people why there has been a decline of 4.2 per cent since the middle of 1989, which was the employment peak, in the number of people employed in the private sector; and rather than trying to acknowledge and attempt to embrace some long term policies to improve the Australian economy, the Government is to its great shame engaging in a disreputable fear campaign and trying to generate a policy difference that Government members know deep down in their hearts does not really exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could believe the Prime Minister if he got up and said, `I have changed my mind and I am now in favour of high tariffs'. But this prime hypocrite, this great destroyer of Australian jobs, has stood up in this Parliament and tried to generate a difference that he, better than most in this Parliament, must know in his quieter moments simply does not exist. He is doing all of this in the name of diverting the gaze. The old injunction about bread and circuses is very true about the Prime Minister. We have had lots of circuses, but probably not a lot of bread over the last 12 months. We have had flags; we have had republics; we have had constitutional debates. Now we are having a great phoney, diverting debate about a non-existent difference between the Government and the Opposition on the question of tariff protection. All of this is being done in the name of diverting public gaze from headlines about private employers losing 180,000 jobs, and from the fact that the Government's unemployment record is disgracefully worse than the unemployment record of countries with which it is fair to make comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training will no doubt reply to this debate. I personally have some regard for him. I do not need to remind him that he sits on a razor's edge in his seat of Swan in Western Australia. If my reading when I was last in Perth is correct, this will perhaps be the penultimate matter of public importance that the honourable member for Swan takes in this place. I say to the Minister that the Australian people are seriously interested deep down in hearing from those men and women opposite about this fundamental problem of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should not try to address it by generating phoney disputes that do not exist. The Leader of the House knows as well as I do that there is no difference of substance between the attitude of the two parties in this Parliament on the issue of tariff protection. One of the things this Parliament has achieved over the last few years, and something which should be supported and extolled and not dragged into the gutter of point scoring politics, is that on a few national interest issues we have been able to reach a degree of bipartisanship. The Government got those tariff cuts through in 1988 without political flak because we supported it. We did not play the grubby game of trying to exploit fear and loathing on a difference that did not exist, and it is a great disgrace that on this occasion the honourable member has decided to play that grubby game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he is doing it for one reason: he is in deep shame about the Government's record on unemployment. The Labor Government is in deep shame about what it has done on the issue of unemployment.

It is significant not because of its arguments, all of which can be readily countered, but because of the honourable member's position. We have here the man who is undeniably the most effective conservative spokesman in Australia and the only real conservative politician, as opposed to ideologue, on the other side of the House, attempting desperately to correct a positioning that in fact reflects real differences but is politically extraordinarily foolish&mdash;that is, a political positioning by his Leader and other inexperienced members of his front bench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all the skills he has developed over the years in this place, and they are considerable, he is unable to achieve that outcome.

They have relied here on a man they spurned so disgracefully a couple of years ago and who, on any reasonable criteria for party leadership, ought to be the leader of their party now. They sought comfort from him, but there is no comfort to be had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is that now we and the Opposition in this country, on the management of economic policy, the direction in which we want this country to go at any level&mdash;be it on tariff policy, on taxation policy, on industry policy, on education policy, on labour market policy generally&mdash;are as chalk and cheese. There has been no point in the history of this country, except perhaps at its very formation, when the differences between the political parties on these issues, and the philosophies underlying them, have been so diverse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For anyone who is in the business of real conservative politics, properly defined, that is a disaster. It is a disaster more for the honourable member for Bennelong, who comes from a different generation of real conservative politicians, than it is for those on the front bench who are here not for the long haul but to experiment with the lives of the people of this nation. They include some extremely wealthy men&mdash;and that is not to be held against them, but it is held against them when they are seen as short term players in the political life of this country who will walk in, experiment, fiddle around with the system and, if their activities fail, will of course say, `That is a tragedy, but we are off'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an example of that recently when the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) was pinned with the obvious in his argument about who was telling the truth, he or a car manufacturer in South Australia, about what that particular car manufacturer had to say to him. At the end of the day, when presented with the unassailable evidence of the person who said he simply would not invest and that therefore logically there would be a certain consequence as far as employment was concerned, all the honourable member for Barker could say was that that would be a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in different places and at different times, has likewise expressed himself as a comet flashing across the firmament of Australian politics to disappear on the other side. That is not a conservative politician's attitude to political life in this country. That is the attitude of a vandal. That is exactly what we now have in Opposition policy: vandal politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very substantial difference between us on tariffs and on the car plan. Let us look at the features of the car plan John Button put in place. It was to go through a phased reduction in tariffs with a set of objectives in place to make the car industry more export oriented and rationalised. It was a classic ministerial-governmental-industrial plan to make that industry more effective and competitive. It was interventionist; there is no question about that. It was not a product of laissez faire attitudes; it was a product designed to ensure the survival of the Australian car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the process, we had a rationalised but surviving car industry in this country. It was interventionist. It was the type of policy that conservative politicians would have found readily acceptable in the 1960s and 1970s; one that people whom the Liberal Party is always prepared to hold up as icons of conservative leadership in this country would have understood, and one which could have been readily accepted by those folk, in a bipartisan way, back in 1988, but cannot be accepted by the Liberal Party front bench now. I suspect the honourable member for Bennelong would dearly love them to be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that Opposition members are indifferent to the survival of the car industry. Their view to take that 15 per cent to nil or thereabouts is fundamentally based on that. Opposition members cannot get away with the repeated comments that have been made by their leader, that if the car industry is capable of hacking it, that is fine; if it is not, it does not matter all that much&mdash;or they do not care. That is the position that has been adopted repeatedly by their Opposition leader. People in the car industry know it because he has said to them, directly and openly, that their survival is a matter of considerable indifference to him. If they can hack it in the system he sets up, good; if they cannot, too bad. In that attitude alone, the differences between us are like chalk and cheese, and there are employment consequences of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members cannot come into this place and argue concern for employment in the private sector and at the same time reject a plan which both the car industry and the Government which has planned it agree will maintain a particular level of employment in the car sector and additional investment, then say that that central planning and that attitude is absolutely an anathema to them. Opposition members cannot say that, as far as they are concerned, whether or not the outcome of their policies is survival of the car industry is a matter of complete indifference to them and then claim that there are similarities between our policies. There are no similarities between our policies on the matter of tariff and the way in which Government relates to the car industry&mdash;none whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to pretend, as the Leader of the Opposition does, is smart politics to try to get the conservative party back on its traditional road in this country, but it is smart politics that conceals the facts of the matter, which are increasingly being exposed as the press, the car industry and the working people in this country come to understand the real agenda of the Leader of the Opposition. I agree with one thing that the Opposition spokesman on employment matters said; that is, all members of this House view the situation of the unemployed people and the levels of unemployment in this country as a national tragedy which has to be corrected. We are all agreed on that. There is no question about that. But we are in total disagreement about how that is to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as statistics are concerned&mdash;and the honourable member for Bennelong argued statistics in supporting his case&mdash;one or two things should be said. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, in mentioning the statistics we do not in any way resile from the fact that it is anything but a tragedy that 180,000 people have lost jobs this year. We are not arguing that point, but since the Opposition has introduced the statistics into the debate there are one or two things worth saying. Since we have been in office our job creation rate has been five times that of the Opposition's. In this recession the jobs that have subsequently been lost amount to some 12 per cent of the jobs that were created in the period that we have been in office. Jobs lost during the 1982-83 recession constituted some 40 per cent of the jobs that had been created in the period of the Liberal-Country Party Government from 1975 to 1983. We cannot escape from those statistics; they happen to be facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition leader&mdash;well, the honourable member for Bennelong, who should be Opposition leader&mdash;spoke about the comparisons between the United Kingdom and us. We were told, `Let's not talk about participation rates'. But let us indeed talk about participation rates. That massive job growth that we have seen in this country over the past decade has been accompanied by a set of increases in participation rates. It reflects the fact that more people in this country believe they have more of an opportunity to work than has ever been the case before. More people in this country believe that they have that opportunity to work than is the position in most countries with which we compare ourselves, including those that the honourable member for Bennelong mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in those circumstances the actual basic unemployment rate&mdash;figures such as 9.8 per cent, 11.1 per cent, 10.3 per cent and all the rest of it&mdash;are calculated against an assessed participation rate. If the participation rate is low, the figures go down. If it is high, they go up. Unless we get a strict participation rate comparison between the two, we do not have a comparative picture of what levels of unemployment are like country on country, or era on era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise that the Liberals take that view, because in 1982-83 some 60 per cent of our people regarded themselves as participating in the work force. That figure is now about 63 1/2 per cent. Therefore, the Opposition's figure of 10.3 per cent unemployment at the peak of the period of recession under the Liberal-Country Party Government roughly equates with a figure of about 14 per cent unemployment now. So our 11 per cent figure ought to be compared with a figure of 14 per cent at that point of time. There is nothing that excuses it, but since the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition introduced these statistics as points of comparison, it is legitimate for us to argue them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the position in Britain. Britain is two or three percentage points behind us in participation rates. Hence, if the United Kingdom had our levels of participation in the work force, if it had encouraged women into the work force in the way in which women have been encouraged into the work force since we have been in office, the British unemployment rates would be somewhere between 13 and 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am cheerful enough about the proposition of the Opposition spokesman to make comparisons between those countries because Thatcherite policies have produced very much larger Budget deficits than we happen to be operating here as Britain seeks to correct the particular problems with which it has to deal. It is necessary to keep those things in mind to understand the extent to which we are relating our unemployment situation to the position in other countries.</PARA>

The Opposition has an alternative point of view to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the area of taxation policy. The Opposition hopes to remove billions of dollars in taxation from business. It will not. The Opposition's position on taxation is fundamentally a tax on labour and on business. That is what a value added tax is. In other countries that have introduced value added taxes it has had nothing to do with improving industrial efficiency and everything to do with revenue raising. I refer to countries with much larger public sectors than ours that have exhausted their capacity to levy income taxes on people. That is basically all there is to it. So those countries introduce consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consumption tax is to be introduced in this country and it will be paid in the first instance and, in many cases, the last instance, by business. It will be $27 billion. When the Opposition makes that shift&mdash;make no mistake about this&mdash;it cannot afford any sliding around the edges. This tax has to be ruthlessly enforced on business. The Opposition cannot allow deductions or anything like that. If it allows a hole like that to develop in its revenue raising, it will be in deep trouble.

It can get rid of payroll tax only by persuading the States to do it. It can persuade the States to do it only if it gives them at least some level of control&mdash;and adjustable control&mdash;over some area of taxation currently levied by the Commonwealth.

The most crud has come out of the mouth of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale). He has told us about the advantages of `Frightpack'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in Question Time, what those opposite intend to do is to impose a 15 per cent value added tax. What attraction does that hold for small business, or any business in Australia&mdash;a 15 per cent value added tax which will be a tax on labour inputs into production? He also said that the GST will seek to raise $27 billion of new tax. What sort of attraction is that for small business, or any business in Australia?  He also pointed out the impact that that would have on inflation and prices. I ask the previous speaker: what attraction do increased interest rates have for small business, or any business for that matter? What attraction does an increased rate of inflation have for any business in Australia, let alone small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the contribution of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who sought to pillory the Government on the issue of tariffs. We heard the response by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). He made it very clear that there is a chasm between the policies of the Opposition and the policies of the Government in relation to tariffs, just as there is a chasm between the policies of the Opposition and the policies of the Government in relation to employment, education and training issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this debate we have heard a great number of figures bandied about. What those opposite ought to understand, and what needs to be repeated, is what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said about the creation of new jobs and participation rates. But those opposite cannot stand it; they do not like the fact that this Government has been extraordinarily successful in the creation of new jobs. As the Minister said, we deplore&mdash;everyone in Australia deplores&mdash;the unemployment that has resulted from the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not be led down the path that the Opposition would take us when it suggests that the recession was unique to Australia. That suggestion is absurd and untrue. As the honourable member for Bruce ought to know, we are not on our Pat Malone in terms of the recession. In terms of the OECD we are a middle order country in the way the recession has impacted upon our economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report said that by mid-1992 about half the OECD countries had experienced a recession. What the honourable member also needs to understand in terms of the recovery about which he spoke is that the lack of synchronisation of the cyclical movements in the major economies, while moderating the downturn, has also acted to prolong the recessionary activity. He ought to understand that, and so should the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two Opposition members should have been honest enough to address the fact that that lack of synchronisation in the international economy is also evident in the Australian economy. It is something which they should accept and which they should have acknowledged in their contributions. On that lack of synchronisation within the Australian economy, the Reserve Bank said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recession was characterised by  greater than normal dispersion in performance among different areas of the country. Victoria and South Australia have been particularly hard-hit but the effects on confidence of the difficulties of some financial institutions . . . have flowed across a range of industries.</PARA>
<PARA>On most indicators the downturns in those two States have been more severe than elsewhere. The Reserve Bank also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sluggish recovery also reflects the adjustment to lower inflation and the other structural changes occurring in the economy. Periods of weak activity often provide the catalyst for change, which takes time to run its course. Business, for example, needed to alter their strategies, and have been doing so; they have been concentrating on reducing costs, raising productivity and lowering their gearing. All these have slowed their recovery but they will help to sustain a robust expansion through the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the estimate for jobs in the Budget is about 160,000. The Government has approached these difficulties with responsible and appropriate policies. There has been a responsible counter-cyclical fiscal injection by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again on the issue of jobs, it is estimated that the counter-cyclical injection of $350m allocated by the local government financial assistance program will create an additional 30,000 jobs. By contrast, the Opposition would run a pro-cyclical fiscal position. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said on 27 August 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent claims by the Opposition Leader and his Shadow Treasurer, that the Opposition's policies would produce jobs "immediately" and "from day one" are complete garbage . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's policy of cutting the deficit by $6-$7 billion, mainly through slashing Government expenditure, would have a devastating effect on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would mean that they would be taking up to 1-1 1/2 off GDP at a time when the reason for low economic growth has been low growth in aggregate demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inevitable consequence would be to pull economic growth back from the budget projections of 3 3/4% through 1992-93 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It would create an additional 125,000 unemployed. That would be the product of the Opposition's policy. But nowhere do we hear acknowledgment of that fact. Instead, those opposite make statements about the car industry and try to disown their contribution to the tariff debate and the statements which have been made to them by people involved in the motor vehicle  industry. What absolute gall for the Opposition to talk about the state of the job market! The day after its mention, Mitsubishi said that the Opposition's zero tariff policy threatened to force it out of manufacturing. Mitsubishi employs 4,200 people, most of whom would lose their jobs under the zero tariff lunacy of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question during Question Time, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) referred to the statement made by Bill Scales, the Chief Executive of the Automotive Industry Authority, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 5 May. Mr Scales said that the Opposition's zero tariff policy would result in the loss of 40,000 of the 45,000 jobs involved in automotive manufacture currently. In other words, there would not be 5,000 more jobs; there would be only 5,000 jobs left in the automotive and manufacturing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We plan a 90 per cent tariff cut. By contrast, the Opposition plans a 90 per cent job cut. The differences between the Opposition and the Government could not be clearer. On the one hand, it is proposing that we should accept this `Frightpack' package which, as I have pointed out, will cost 125,000 jobs in the first couple of years. It will impose upon businesses around Australia the extraordinary impost of the GST as a value added tax. That will cost thousands of jobs in the public sector. That will mean for Australians wherever they live&mdash;in the remote corners of northern Australia or even the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;a cut in services unprecedented in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Opposition is not prepared to accept the debate on the question of tariffs. We know that the local car manufacturing industry would be under threat. We know that in the tariff debate the Opposition has gone to water on the issue of sugar. We know that this is not the only area where the Opposition has been shown to be false and wrong. The honourable member for Bennelong is concerned because the Government has had the impertinence to debate the issue of tariffs&mdash;a debate which was started by the Opposition and which has demonstrated that the Opposition will cut 125,000 jobs out of the Australian work force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion at this early stage in the sittings as I am mindful of the enormous business program that the Government has before it. I also have in mind the desire of all members to be able to participate in debate on the legislation which will be to hand and which already is to hand. In particular, I am concerned that we should have an opportunity to debate reasonably extensively the Appropriation Bills which, if we continue to operate under the 11 o'clock rule, we will not be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there are some 120 items of legislation around. About 30 pieces have already been introduced and the bulk will be coming in over the next sitting weeks. We will be obliged to debate quite a substantial number of packages of that legislation. A fair bit of the debate will be cognate but there will nevertheless be a substantial number of packages. The intention is not to keep this House sitting to absurd hours night after night but to conclude matters around 12 midnight and, if sensible, enable adjournment debates to take place from time to time.

By starting this early with allowing the odd hour extra a night, we will effectively build up the equivalent of a week's extra sittings&mdash;certainly of Government business time&mdash;by the time the normal course of this session concludes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that reluctantly we will agree to the motion that is being put. However, I say to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that it is probably appropriate that he has come to the chamber a little earlier than usual. We have all been witness to some incredibly late night sittings and some ridiculously long hours in past years. Whatever the reasons might be for the build-up of legislation, it is better to start early in trying to determine the sitting patterns of the House to make sure that we do not get into that crazy situation where we are threatened in the last week of sittings for the year with the prospect of having to come back for another period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Leader of the House says that there will be about 120 pieces of legislation coming into the chamber and that we have about 30 before us now. There is obviously quite a deal more legislation to come in. As I have said in the past, it is a matter for the legislative committee of Cabinet to take account of the workings of Parliament. Whilst there seems to be this incredible bunching of legislation towards the end of a session, one would have to ask why it is that Ministers are unable to get to the legislative committee of Cabinet earlier with their proposed pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could well be that the Government is moving quickly to prepare for an election. Who knows?  In any event, this would be one of the things the Government would need to do, if that was the case. Maybe that is a matter for the Leader of the House to respond to, but I know that he would not, in any event. By agreeing to this motion we will have the equivalent of an additional week's sitting&mdash;an extra week's work&mdash;to deal with Government business. However, in so doing, we are not going to negate the right of members to be able to participate in adjournment debates. That is particularly significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the reports by the Standing Committee on Procedure to the Parliament. I think the 1986 report was the most extensive one done about sitting times and patterns and the effective use of the Parliament's time. One of the things that were made clear at that time was that members wanted to make sure there was ample time for private members' activity. The adjournment debate is extremely important, and we would not countenance for one moment any move that would lessen that time. I welcome the statement by the Leader of the House that during this period where the sitting of the House is extended to midnight that time will still be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice from that report back in 1986 that a recommendation was made that there be a business committee to facilitate the programming of the business to the House. I do not have an appreciation of what took place at that time, but my understanding is that that recommendation was rejected by the Government. I am not aware of what the reasons were, although there has always been a recognition of a need to streamline the activities of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that has passed since 1986 to the present, and given that I am giving a speech that my predecessor has given and his predecessor has given about the management of business in the House, it might well be a signal to all of us in here to take a closer look at how we might manage business in the chamber. I am still of a strong view that it is a matter for the Government of the day to determine its priorities much earlier in advance so that we do not get a bunching of legislation at the end of the session. That is obviously what will occur on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a comment about the Appropriation Bills. The most important legislation that goes through this Parliament on a regular basis is the legislation which authorises a government to spend taxpayers' funds. There ought to be ample opportunity for all members, regardless of which party they represent, to pursue matters of interest to them and to their constituents. That is a fundamental role for the Parliament. Any matter which gives ample time for those matters to be pursued should be supported. But if it is a trade-off to limit time for debate on the Appropriation Bills as against time for Government business, I think the balance should be in support of making sure that there is time for the appropriations debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House said the fundamental reason is that he wants to have that time for the appropriations debate. We in the Opposition will ensure, as we watch the hours unfold, that that does take place and that we do not start to transgress on that time, that the professed reason for putting forward this motion is not removed, and that the Government's business gets priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the final matter of the Government's business, the swimming pool tax matter has ping-ponged backwards and forwards around this place today, but I understand it is coming back to the chamber. It might be that the amendments proposed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) are a direct result of having had some extensive debate in this chamber yesterday about that matter. That is an indication in itself of the success of allowing time for debate about contentious matters, particularly matters that raise revenue. The Government has benefited from the detailed scrutiny given in this chamber to the confusion that it has got itself into. We will not divide on this motion. We would want the matter to proceed. But we will watch to ensure that time is given to debate the Appropriation Bills and that members' private time on the adjournment is preserved. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to implement a reform package for the Pipeline Authority to enable it to achieve a more commercially orientated approach to its operations. In just over 20 years, natural gas has grown from a small base to become Australia's third most important energy source, accounting for 17 per cent of primary energy demand. The recent supply-demand study by the Australian Gas Association indicates that the Australian gas industry is now on another threshold of growth, not only as a major, reliable supplier to the domestic energy market but also as a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AGA study indicates market opportunities for natural gas are expected to grow strongly in the years ahead, with new market opportunities, including greater use in power generation, particularly co-generation, and in the transport sector. Australia has already made an impressive entrance onto the world LNG stage. Exports from the North West Shelf project are forecast to grow to seven million tonnes per annum by 1995. At these levels, the export value of LNG, oil and condensate from the North West Shelf could approach $3 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project is already making a significant and sustained contribution to our balance of payments, and there are excellent prospects for further major expansions of the industry. Shell Australia, for example, has identified a $6 billion to $8 billion expansion opportunity for Australia's LNG industry over the next five years, based on growth in Asian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government strongly supports LNG exports and, as a major element in the natural gas strategy, has assisted future growth of the industry through removal of volume controls on LNG exports. This move has been welcomed by the industry as a positive step to assist the development of LNG export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry responses to the national gas strategy have been unanimous in supporting the Government's view that a truly national approach is needed to help develop our natural gas reserves fully. The promotion of free and fair interstate gas trade is one of the key points in the national gas strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the industry's belief that it is essential to free up markets to provide the incentive for future development of Australia's domestic and export gas industry. In particular, unrestricted interstate gas trade is essential for the exploration and the development of markets and related infrastructure. There can be no compromise on this point if we are to move towards an efficient national market in natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AGA gas supply and demand study reinforces the need to move towards a national gas market and provides a timely warning of the costs involved if parochial attitudes and self-interest by the States and Territories prevent free and open interstate trade in gas. The AGA estimates that the cost to Australians of higher prices due to restricted interstate gas trade would, over the period to the year 2030, be in the range $1.5 billion to $4 billion in net present value terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Producers are already seeking additional markets for gas from areas such as south-west Queensland and the Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory. These, and other reserves, are likely to remain underdeveloped unless State and Territory administrations lend their support to unrestricted gas trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional plank in the national gas strategy was reform of government instrumentalities. The Government's direct role in natural gas operations is restricted largely to its ownership of TPA. In turn, the Authority owns and operates the natural gas transmission pipeline that extends approximately 1,300 kilometres from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. At Wilton, the natural gas is delivered to the Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, whose subsidiaries are responsible for gas reticulation throughout the Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle regions. Lateral pipelines supply natural gas to regional markets, including the Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Young, Junee, Canberra and Bathurst-Orange regions and, soon, to the Riverina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government announced in late 1989 that it would develop a reform package for TPA as part of the Government's wider agenda for micro-economic reform. In November 1991, as part of the national gas strategy, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to implement reform of TPA to make it more efficient and competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992 Budget, the Government announced the inclusion of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system in its program of asset sales. The sale of the pipeline system is unlikely to be completed before the 1993-94 financial year at the earliest. This was recognised in the Budget statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, the Government believes that reform of TPA, including putting its commercially based operations into a government business enterprise-style subsidiary, is essential and should not be delayed further. These reforms will enable the return on TPA's assets to be optimised in the lead-up to the proposed sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms proposed in this legislation will enable TPA, through a subsidiary corporation, to compete on a more equal footing with other participants in Australia's natural gas industry and to be involved in a wider range of commercially based activities than its present Act allows. The reforms will provide the means for TPA to become a more effective operator in the gas sector and to take advantage of commercial opportunities as they arise. This approach will ensure optimal returns to the Government and the Australian people from the activities of the TPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central feature of the reform package is to provide for the creation of a subsidiary of TPA to undertake those operations of TPA that are based on a commercial rate of return. This will include the Canberra and Oberon laterals and the proposed Riverina pipeline extension to Griffith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TPA has contracts with AGL covering the carriage of gas through these pipelines. The Government has consulted with AGL on the proposed transfer of assets and has taken that company's concerns into account in the preparation of the legislation. There is no element in the reform proposals embodied in this legislation which would be prejudicial to AGL's existing contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation requires the approval of the Minister for Resources before a subsidiary can be created. The Minister's approval will outline the reporting requirements whereby strategic ministerial control will be exercised over the subsidiary consistent with the guidelines for government business enterprise accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TPA has, in the past, been significantly constrained by its Act in the type of activities it can undertake. The current Act limits TPA to constructing, owning and operating pipelines within Australia. It cannot be involved in other activities, such as operating a pipeline it does not own, and it has been limited to providing consultancy services within Australia, and then only after obtaining ministerial approval. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new subsidiary will be subject to taxation and will be required to make dividend payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the subsidiary will operate as a commercial government business enterprise, TPA will continue to operate the Moomba to Sydney mainline and the laterals to Lithgow and Wagga Wagga on the cost recovery basis determined by existing contracts between TPA and AGL. </PARA>

<PARA>The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 will give effect to a change in the payment arrangements for family allowance. Family allowance will be called family payment from 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the outstanding success of the family allowance bonus paid earlier this year, the Government has decided that payments of family allowance should be more flexible.

The person requesting the advance would be able to receive up to half of the amount that would be paid in respect of what is known as the first child rate&mdash;$20.90 per fortnight as from 1 January 1993&mdash;as a lump sum. The remaining half of the family allowance entitlement would continue to be paid fortnightly. The advance is not to be paid in respect of a particular child, rather as an advance of an amount otherwise payable to a family in receipt of family allowance.

At the time of the request the person can opt to have the lump sum advance paid only in respect of the following six months period or on an ongoing basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When debate on the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill was interrupted last night, it was interesting that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) came in to join us because of some consternation on his part engendered by remarks made by Opposition members opposed to the way that this Bill would handle the issue of sales tax for the swimming pool industry and specifically on the mechanisms for refunding pool builders and pool owners in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the adjournment debate last night, the Treasurer moved to the corridors outside where we held further discussions on this issue. Accompanying him were two members of the Taxation Office advising him on this matter. It became clear to me that the real problem generated by this Bill arises because of a misunderstanding on the part of the Treasurer, probably the Government, and certainly on the part of certain Taxation Office officials. That misunderstanding is basic to the understanding of the role of business and industry in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that one of the main reasons that brought me to this place was that the Taxation Office held a view of Australian business and commerce and industry that the only reason people were in business was to rip other people off, and that business and industry are not there to produce goods and services desired and required by the community. The tax officers made it clear last night that they misunderstand the pool builders in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in this debate, I made it clear that, between 1986 and February 1992, there were two issues relating to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. The first of those issues relates to the period from 1986 to mid-1990. During that period pool builders tried to charge their clients tax. In some manner or other they collected tax from pool owners and remitted that tax to the Government. That period of tax collection has now been deemed by the High Court to be of an  unconstitutional nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems engendered by this Bill is the fact that it is the Treasurer's view that we still have to use the wholesale sales tax mechanism for refunding that so-called tax collected by pool builders from pool owners and remitted to the Taxation Office, but because the tax was found to be of no effect&mdash;that is, a nil tax&mdash;it is not a tax and it is clear that refund mechanisms which exist in the Income Tax Assessment Act are no longer applicable and do not necessarily need to be followed in the refund mechanism associated with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must make it clear to the Treasurer, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), who is at table, and the Taxation Office officials here that they can use mechanisms outside the tax Act to refund the tax to those pool owners. One of the problems we have is that this recession has brought with it the demise of many pool builders. A great number of pool owners out there are due a tax refund but, under this Bill, they will never get it. While the Bill talks about windfall gains for pool builders, what in fact will happen is that there will be a windfall gain for the Tax Office because it will not legitimately refund tax paid by pool owners to pool builders who no longer exist because they have either gone into liquidation or simply, due to lack of business, ceased trading. The period from 1986 to mid-1990 is half of the problem with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other half of the problem started in mid-1990 when those legitimate pool builders, who were paying their tax but believed that there were some less honest pool builders not collecting or remitting the tax and placing the legitimate pool builders in an uncompetitive situation, obtained legal advice. That legal advice said that the Government had imposed a tax which was not a tax and that, if they mounted a High Court challenge, it would be found to be unconstitutional. It turned out that that advice was correct and in February this year the High Court so found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim, in 1990, the pool companies made a decision regarding the funds which they thought they might have to remit to the Taxation Office. They decided that, if they lost the case, they would place the money in an escrow fund to keep it out of harm's way, but it was their money. The Tax Office, in negotiations with the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia, made an agreement that the pool builders should send those theoretical tax moneys to the Tax Office and, if the Tax Office lost the High Court challenge, it would refund the moneys to the pool builders together with interest. The Tax Office, as recently as 6 August this year, confirmed that those moneys were due to the pool builders and not necessarily to any pool owners, as the majority of pool builders between mid-1990 and February 1992 paid money to the Tax Office without charging tax to their clients because they were in an uncompetitive situation, as compared with those builders who were not collecting the tax, and this precluded them from charging and collecting tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to me that the Tax Office fails to understand that it has an obligation to business, through its agreement with business, and that it is no longer willing to honour that obligation or, if it is, the Minister and his representative here are imposing it through this Bill. That is what is inequitable. It is all brought about by the fact that this Labor Government and the Tax Office have no concept of how business operates, what its objectives are and what it attempts to accomplish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a great deal in this place about tariff policy, about understanding business and micro-economic reform. But the basic issue is that, if one understands how business people think, one knows that it is the paperwork burden and the imposts that this Labor Government has placed on business that are causing the major portion of our problem in terms of recovering from this recession, which was also brought on by this Government. If the Labor Government understood business and industry, we would never have had 24 or 25 per cent interest rates in Australia. Surely it would have known that it would have to drive thousands of businesses to the wall, which is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swimming pool industry that we are discussing today is a case in point&mdash;and a very dramatic one. I remind those opposite that it is the Australian public that wants swimming pools, otherwise there would be no industry. These people are not in business to rip off home owners; they are in business to build swimming pools for people who want them. We should commend them for having the initiative and the foresight and for taking the action to risk their own money to go into business to provide facilities wanted by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government fails to understand the risk-taking involved in business; it fails to understand the competitive nature of business; it fails to understand the dramatic cost that it puts on business on the input side of the equation. Now, through this Bill, it is refusing to honour its honest obligation to business and the swimming pool industry in Australia by refunding the money that it had agreed to refund if it lost the High Court challenge. I say again that I wish the Treasurer would take notice of this debate. I suggest to the Committee that we adopt the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has mentioned, there is an amendment before the Chair. The amendment, which relates to proposed new clause 3A, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in this Act applies to the agreement constituted by conversations and letters in November 1990 between representatives of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia Limited and the Australian Taxation Office relating to in situ pool tax, or to any payment that the Commonwealth is liable to make to any person pursuant to that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>In my speech during the debate on the second reading, and perhaps at the committee stage last night, I said that I understood the Australian Taxation Office was responsible for reneging on that agreement. Since then there has been at least a suggestion&mdash;and I think it is stronger than that&mdash;that it was the Government's decision, not the Taxation Office's decision, to go back on that agreement. If that is so, I tender my apologies to the ATO and the officers involved. I certainly do not offer my congratulations, though, to the Government if it were responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill effectively sets out to nullify the agreement between the SPASA and the ATO, even though it is not referred to expressly in the Bill. It is not referred to in the Bill, the seconding reading speech or the explanatory memorandum; nevertheless, the result of the technique used in drafting clauses 4(1) and 6 has that effect. Naturally the SPASA raised an objection that the Bill has the effect of retrospectively depriving those builders party to the agreement of their rights under that agreement. As it is germane to the point I am making, I wonder whether I might have leave to table the copies which are in evidence of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;SPASA has asserted that on the basis of legal advice its High Court challenge would be successful and, therefore, its members would receive a refund of moneys paid to the Australian Taxation Office. The sales tax was not passed on to members' customers during the period that the agreement was in effect. I might say that agreements with the ATO are not uncommon. In fact, we hear every day of the Commissioner reaching a settlement with an individual taxpayer or a group of taxpayers to interpret and treat the tax laws in a particular way. If these agreements between the ATO and taxpayers to settle outstanding tax issues are a regular part of the Australian tax system&mdash;and they are&mdash;it is a very serious step and is full of implications for the administration of the tax system in this country if an agreement freely entered into is to be abrogated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Bill effectively does, and that is what our amendment seeks to overcome. Should the Bill be allowed to nullify this SPASA agreement, it will be the first time to my knowledge that the ATO, either in its own right or at the behest of a government, has reneged on a deal. If that precedent is to occur, taxpayers will never again have confidence that agreements with the Australian Taxation Office would not be unilaterally revoked&mdash;in other words, they would be meaningless. I would like to ask the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) whether in his response he could confirm whether it was the Government's decision to abrogate the agreement or a decision made by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation or his delegate. For these reasons I suggest there are strong grounds to amend the Bill to exclude the SPASA-ATO agreement from its ambit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Institute confirms that the Bill appears to abrogate pre-existing rights of persons to seek refunds under the agreement, but it goes on to say that it appears to abrogate the pre-existing rights of persons to seek refunds at common law. That is a very important matter that I do not think has been raised before. I am advised, and it is usually very reliable advice, that the precedent set in Werrin's case is to be specifically attacked in this legislation. That case stipulated that for someone to be entitled to a refund at common law, payment of tax has to be made involuntarily. The Tax Commissioner in ST2456 indicated that this common law principle would not be followed where a specific statutory provision allows for a refund of sales tax, and that is the situation we are in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also will act to deprive pool owners, builders, or whoever it may be, people who have borne the tax, from rights at common law. It does that in the wording of clause 4(1) which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except as provided by this section, the Commonwealth is not liable to make an in situ pool tax refund payable to a person.</PARA>
<PARA>So there it is. I might add that the interest payment provisions in clause 5 of the Bill are a bit dodgy too, but as that matter is not under consideration in this amendment I do not intend to go into that now. </PARA>

When the matter was put back this morning to a later hour this day or another day there was some glimmer of hope that we had actually prevailed in our debate. But one has the impression that perhaps one is wasting one's time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the legislation that has been debated in this House in recent times, I have never felt so strongly that we are totally right in the point of view that we are putting to the Government on this occasion. Therefore, I was optimistic in thinking that we may have prevailed in the debate we were putting. Our amendment is perfectly reasonable. I will be very interested to hear the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) address the issue of our amendment. Last night in his response to the debate his remarks were dismissive and perfunctory. I thought that more could have been expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to respond and to tell us and the people of Australia why the ATO, on instructions from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or from the Government, has reneged on the agreement&mdash;which it confirmed in writing to the Swimming Pool and Spa Association as recently as the end of July of this year&mdash;that had been entered into in respect of the quarantining of the tax that it had been paid since 1990 and has turned its back on that particular agreement. We want to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other questions which once again I ask the Minister. Why has the Government not addressed the two other major concerns that we have expressed about this legislation? Very simply, what happens to the many people in my electorate whose pool builders are no longer in business? The Treasurer now tells me&mdash;and this compounds the error&mdash;that the High Court did not determine that money needed to be refunded in that situation. So the Treasurer, in effect, is hiding behind that decision and that seems to me to be most unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of those people I am now being told that the Government now has no legal obligation. Yet I remind the Treasurer of what was said. In the Budget Papers it is clearly said that as a result of that case $50m or $60m of sales tax would be refunded. That is patently now not true. The Government has a responsibility&mdash;if not a legal one, then surely a moral responsibility&mdash;to do what it said it would do, and that is to give money back to the people who built pools and who paid sales tax illegally, who paid money to the Government which they did not have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question which remains unanswered, which the Minister Assisting the Treasurer may be able to answer, is the question that has been posed by all speakers in this debate. On the mechanism that is proposed, surely it is totally inadequate to expect small business people, pool builders, to go out and borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars to refund to their customers and then apply to the Taxation Office for reimbursement, a process that could take months. That surely is a most unsatisfactory and unreasonable way to approach this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three questions remain totally unanswered. I hope that when the Minister Assisting the Treasurer responds we may yet get some reasonable response. If we can get some answers, perhaps we will be satisfied, but as yet in debate the Government has not given us a satisfactory answer. That is the reason for our opposition to this Bill and for our amendment. That is not because its objectives are not laudable. The Government has an obligation to give back the money that it got illegally and we support that, but we totally refute the proposed mechanism. I hope that these questions might yet be adequately answered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a number of points. Firstly, I think the basic principle underlying the Government's position on this legislation stands. We feel it is important to have a refund mechanism to ensure that the pool owner stands to benefit. The problem with the Opposition amendment, which seeks to give effect to its interpretation of the SPASA agreement, is that it would lead to a situation where a raft of pool builders, members of SPASA, would gain an unfettered right to receive a refund without necessarily passing it on to the individual pool owner. Our legislation tries to protect the pool owner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office does not purport to be abrogating the agreement. It maintains that it is disputing the content and meaning of the agreement that was entered into with SPASA, and that matter is currently before the Federal Court. I do not intend to go into detail as to the Tax Office position on that because that would contravene sub judice conventions. However, I simply note for the information of the House that the interpretation of that agreement between SPASA and the Tax Office is in dispute and is currently the subject of litigation before the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important also to stress that, under clause 4(2)(c) of the legislation, if a pool builder claims to have absorbed the tax and not passed it on to the pool owner, an entitlement is provided for the pool builder to receive a refund. The pool builder obviously needs to be in a position to substantiate that claim, but the legislation specifically makes provision for that. We are not in the business of providing a windfall gain to pool builders and providing an entitlement to a refund irrespective of whether the pool builder has made a refund to the pool owner for any tax passed on. That is the essence of our position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend that this mechanism is totally perfect. In a situation such as this it is very difficult to see what sort of perfect mechanism there could be. The case of pool builders who have subsequently gone bankrupt is obviously a difficult one to deal with. Since it is the pool builders who in the first instance pay the tax, it is very difficult to see how we could refund the tax directly to the pool owner, given that the pool owner would scarcely be in a position even to know the amount of tax that was implicitly passed on. I do not see what alternative mechanism there might be to the one the Government has outlined. The effect of the Opposition's proposal would be to provide a windfall gain to a range of pool builders. In the process, the ultimate bearers of the tax&mdash;in most cases the pool owners&mdash;would be denied a refund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made a brief contribution to the debate last evening when the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill was before the chamber, and I have listened with some interest to the discussions in committee. It seems to me that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has raised a couple of very interesting points. I think there is some case to be argued that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) needs to take on board some of the comments that have been mentioned, in particular the difficulties and constraints now confronting those people who have a pool which was built by a contractor who is no longer in operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point raised by the honourable member for La Trobe in identifying that that collection has now been determined by the High Court to be of no effect seems to be an avenue worthy of consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget and Appropriation Bills before the House are critical pieces of legislation, but the Dawkins Budget has failed. It has vanished across the horizon, after it was launched with great fanfare a couple of weeks ago. Of course, the Budget contained some major political blunders. I plan to highlight those in the course of this consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say at the outset that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a political animal first and an Australian citizen second. I will not forgive Prime Minister Keating for that. He is prepared to place at risk the economic recovery and the social fabric of this nation, and not look after the true national interest. He does that day after day in the way he revisits a range of issues in his divisive economic policies and in his Budget framework itself. I think it has been well exposed in the aftermath of the Budget when one looks at some of the editorial comment.

<PARA>Editorial after editorial said this Budget failed. It is the Budget that backfired; the Budget that failed to give Australia the real leadership, the real advance forward, the framework to carry Australia back onto the rails, and this is totally and absolutely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bitter disappointment to the one million Australians unemployed, and there are more unemployment statistics to come tomorrow. It is a bitter disappointment for many people that, at a time when they felt they could get a Budget and leadership from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), they got this extraordinary Dawkins Budget. As well, they got massive deficit, tinkering on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> and, also, some hidden tax agendas&mdash;which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), has well exposed&mdash;that came from the Budget Speech.

<PARA>There, honourable members, is the clear pointer by Treasurer Dawkins that there is a series of secret Budget tax initiatives that, in the very unlikely event Labor is re-elected, will make the funds add and balance the Budget settings of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in a very penetrating Question Time, which included questions by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as well as by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), we exposed the Treasurer's Achilles heel, not only in relation to prescribed payments but also in respect of fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and provisional tax. These are the secret taxes which this Government is going to bring back if it is given half a chance. Clearly, the people have had enough and they are not even going to give the Government that half a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of tariffs and trade in relation to the Budget. A lot of humbug is being spoken by the Prime Minister on the issue and by that famous six-pack which held a press conference at high noon today in relation to the issue. It included the chairman of the Prime Minister's Government task force, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). It is very interesting that, while he is calling for a series of resignations, during the last up period the Cattlemen's Union, which met in Toowoomba, carried a motion of no confidence in the honourable member for Hinkler. That reflects his standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That strong, relevant, independent thinking body&mdash;the Cattlemen's Union&mdash;is hardly in the pocket of the National Party. Indeed, on many occasions it has attacked the National Party. It has attacked previous coalition governments, it has attacked Labor governments and it has even carried motions of no confidence in honourable members on the coalition side of the House. But what did it do at its 1992 annual conference in Toowoomba? It carried a motion of no confidence in the honourable member for Hinkler and said it had had enough of the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force; it had had enough of the chairman of the sugar task force. The honourable member for Hinkler no longer enjoyed the confidence of that key organisation which, of course, is very significantly spread across Queensland, especially in the electorate of Hinkler which has a great, thriving beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the tariff and trade issue, buried away in the Budget Papers is a very interesting statement which puts into perspective this whole argument over trade and tariffs. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the May 1988 Economic Statement, the Government announced a broad program of phased tariff reductions, which reduced most nominal tariff rates to 15 or 10 per cent. The exceptions were the passenger vehicle and textiles, clothing and footwear industries, which were subject to special industry restructuring plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced further tariff reductions in March 1991. Tariffs at 15 or 10 per cent on 1 July 1992 will be phased down to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in 2000. Tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear will be phased down from a range between 15 and 51 per cent in 1992 to a range between 5 and 25 per cent in 2000, and quotas will be abolished on 1 March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 1 July 1992 it is estimated that the average effective rate of assistance to manufacturing was 12 per cent. By the year 2000, the average effective rate of assistance to manufacturing will have declined to around 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been estimated that the reductions in protection announced in 1988 and 1991 will result in a permanent real increase in GDP of about 1 per cent. The actual effect will be higher as factors such as better management, innovation and greater competition come into play.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's charter on trade and tariffs. It is a series of ugly tariff reductions&mdash;the types of tariff reductions that one has when one does not have tax reform, industrial relations reform or genuine micro-economic reform. These are stand-alone tariff cuts of the worst kind. They come without any of the Fightback reforms&mdash;without the abolition of payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax. They are very ugly tariff cuts. They are legislated for by this Labor Government and they are ones that it is now acutely embarrassed about because of their impact on industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spell out very clearly that the coalition alternative is all about a gradual and graduated reduction in tariffs over a period of years through to the next century&mdash;not overnight, not without front end loading, but a range of benefits to industry. Of course, the benefits of industrial relations reform, taxation reform and micro-economic reform will be delivered in conjunction with those industries. We will deliver big figures. For example, for Australian agriculture there will be a $1 billion benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for the Northern Territory sniggers. These are Federal Treasury figures. The Federal Treasury released a document saying that a $1 billion benefit for Australian agriculture will flow from Fightback. It also says that $5 billion will flow to manufacturing industry from Fightback. Those are the benefits that we will front end load in getting a right and relevant trade and tariff policy in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) will have more to say on this issue when he speaks in the debate shortly. But I want to add that in all of this it is our absolute commitment to seek to retain a manufacturing industry and to provide the framework which will retain a manufacturing industry, a passenger motor vehicle industry and a decentralised Australian agricultural industry, including a progressive sugar industry, a progressive beef industry and a progressive wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against all odds, we will set an agenda and do the sorts of things that other countries have succeeded in doing&mdash;to provide a firm basis and reform framework so that these industries can develop and expand and be viable against all odds, given the fact that there is no such thing as an international level playing field. I have said very clearly and repeatedly that we on this side of the House recognise that there is no such thing as an international level playing field. But we will address it in the correct way&mdash;not in the hocus-pocus, back flipping, backsliding way of a Prime Minister desperate to inject some hope into his re-election stocks&mdash;a Prime Minister who is a political animal first and an Australian citizen second. I hesitate to use that terminology but I am afraid that I, my colleagues and thousands of Australians have had enough of the rhetoric of the Prime Minister. They have had enough of a government which has failed to deliver the right sort of leadership to lead this country out of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in terms of tariffs and trade, there is a second dimension that I want to put on the record of the House. It is all about a sensible, tough and fair trade strategy which is not about backdoor protection but is about establishing a framework for Australian industry, especially our food producing and processing industry, and giving it a fair go. The first leg of that is adequate anti-dumping laws. They are not adequate by virtue of amendments that this Labor Government has brought in to slow down the various procedures under the anti-dumping legislation. Well, we have had enough of that. We are going to toughen up and tighten the anti-dumping legislation in a purposeful and practical way which will put some balance into the anti-dumping effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there will be completion of the elimination of the many labelling law anomalies which have existed for years. Of course I do not blame the Federal Labor Government entirely for this. It is a matter for both State and Federal governments, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party has pointed out on many occasions. It is not good enough to have jam from Jamaica come to Australia, be rebottled in Brisbane and put out on the shelves as product of Australia when it is jam from Jamaica. At long last the Australian Customs Service has established a task force to crack down on misleading labelling. It is long overdue. But we need to do more than that. There is still a series of anomalies which have to be addressed. With the importation of Canadian pork, for example, the label `Canadian pork' should be clearly visible so that that fact can be addressed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labelling requirements involve a cycle of meetings between officers at State and Federal level. That process is bureaucratic in its nature. I understand that the recommendation on Canadian pork just missed the most recent round of meetings so it could be another six or 12 months before we have any labelling requirement. That is not good enough. We have to have tougher labelling standards and police them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third leg of a fairer trade strategy is a revamping of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The operation of that service has failed in many ways. Until recently it still had 60 meat inspectors at towns and cities where there are no longer operating abattoirs&mdash;a cost tag to the taxpayer and to the meat industry which is unacceptable. AQIS has to be far more aggressive in terms of carrying out its role legitimately. We have a number of plans for credentialling and restructuring which make a lot of sense. Interestingly enough, a number of European countries are now moving down the credentialling path rather than having all meat inspectors employed by a central authority. So we have anticipated credentialled meat inspection; it is the correct way forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority is a new organisation trying to carve out its niche. But it is judged by the fact that until recently there were only seven food inspectors looking at imported food. I want to tell honourable members what the State of Victoria found when in 1988 it did a comprehensive inspection of imported food. It found that 59 per cent of foreign food imported into Victoria in the year 1988 was non-complying. Since that time, we have been known as a soft touch for the dumping of substandard food imports and the like. So let us have a sensible and fairer trade strategy in relation to Australia's overall trade and tariff approach, and let us combine that with a sensible, gradual tariff reduction process over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government has the Courtice committee wandering around to mislead the sugar industry. The Industry Commission report is there for all to see. The Government can keep saying until it is blue in the face that it will not reduce sugar tariffs. But watch this space, because the Industry Commission recommends zero tariffs for the sugar industry by 1998. I want to make it very clear that, if this Government legislates to that end, we will relegislate to make it a softer and fairer schedule of reductions by kicking it out to the year 2000&mdash;no ifs, no buts. I place that on the record. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, Australia has little choice but to go down that path if it wants to build up its trade links with Asia and to remove barriers. Those who would like to continue to snuggle under the blanket rather than to get out in the cold air can do that for a period but, ultimately, they have no choice, they have to get out from under the blanket. Fortress Australia, with 150 per cent protection walls right around Australia, is exactly the wrong way to go. We have had the courage to state that. The Prime Minister previously had the courage to state that, but he has now walked away from that entirely with his rhetoric in a way which makes him the political animal that he is, and I concede that. He is not an Australian citizen determined to get the economy back on the rails. He is going to pay an awful price for the damage he is wreaking by making this an extremely partisan policy area when the policy differences are minutiae in real terms, if one examines them, a lip on the cup argument, and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will turn to another area of the Budget. I refer to petrol and diesel fuel excise taxes which are reaffirmed in this Budget and which, for the first time, will extract over $7 billion from the motorist. This is a rip-off of some 26c a litre across Australia. It is a tax on decentralisation across Australia. It is a tax on the quality of life of retirees and pensioners especially in many towns and cities where they simply do not have access to public transport. Mr Deputy Speaker, many pockets of your own electorate are a long way from extended public transport. Therefore, as one moves up through Warringah, the people there are also placed at a disadvantage by this horrific tax level of fuel excise and so little of it comes back to the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget, for the first time, extracts $7 billion from the motorist. Only about $1.4 billion of that will come back to the roads. Is it not time that we had a more honest approach to the whole business of transport in this country? Bob Hawke got one thing right in his last year in office: he told the road transport forum in March of last year that the transport industry pays 3 1/2 times more tax than any other industry in Australia. We are addressing that problem. We are abolishing all petrol, diesel and avgas fuel excise tax. Those opposite, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) in particular, are supporting a Budget that maintains those horrific tax levels which hurt especially the citizens of the Northern Territory in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I condemn this Budget for the inadequate document that it is. It fails to provide the leadership that Australia requires at this critical time. Effectively, it will be rejected by the people at the next Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address one or two substantive issues which the honourable member raised. He talked about food costs in the Northern Territory. If he has not read Fightback in its entirety he may not realise that products&mdash;including food products&mdash;in the Northern Territory may well be very much cheaper under the Opposition's proposal. Surely one of the main costs of doing business in the Northern Territory and in other remote parts of Australia is transportation. Is that not a fact? The honourable member has left the chamber now, but if he were here perhaps he could tell me otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that I understand the country and the problems of remote areas&mdash;and I admit that my understanding is not great&mdash;it is transportation costs which add significantly to the cost of goods. If there is one outstanding element in Fightback&mdash;there are many; but if we wanted to pick only one&mdash;it is the fact that taking out wholesale sales tax and taking off fuel excise, payroll tax and so on will bring down transportation costs remarkably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because it was at least something substantive in the speech by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and something which I could grab hold of. I hope that when he reads Fightback he might be prepared to admit that under the GST which we propose rather than food being more expensive in the Northern Territory, in the context of the whole of Fightback it may very well be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member had a shot at me for representing the very fine electorate of McPherson, which is based on the Gold Coast.

Not only is the Gold Coast Australia's leading tourist resort, but also I am prepared to concede&mdash;and I am sorry he is not present to hear me do this because I am a very reasonable person&mdash;that both Darwin and Alice Springs are also very fine tourist destinations. I have visited them both on a number of occasions. As I have a great interest in the tourism industry&mdash;and I will comment a little about the Budget and tourism in a moment&mdash;I am prepared to say to the honourable member that we do have that in common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the tourism industry and I see enormous potential in northern Australia. In fact, I believe a substantial proportion of the explosion in international tourism which we will experience in Australia in the next decade will be in the north of Australia. That of course includes Queensland and the Northern Territory, which has so much to offer international visitors. I am as excited as anyone else when I visit those places and see the tremendous tourist attractions in the centre of Australia, for example, and in the areas outside Darwin, including the wonderful Kakadu National Park. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many speakers on this side of the House have pointed to the deficiencies in the recent Budget. In his response, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) summed it up adequately and completely when he said that it was dead in the water almost from day one. I do not want to dwell too much on the Budget as a whole, but I want to say a few things about one substantial group of Australians who have apparently been completely forgotten by the Government. I am speaking about the so called self-funded retirees or, as they are often referred to, independent retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many independent retirees in Australia. The numbers vary from 600,000 to 900,000, depending on how one measures independence in retirement. Most of these people, of course, have saved during their working lives to provide for their retirement. I openly acknowledge that I have a very substantial number living in my electorate. In fact, there are around 25,000 self-funded retirees and around 25,000 retired folk who are living on social security on the Gold Coast, so we have a very substantial retired population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without in any way casting aspersions on the pensioners, I want to contrast the treatment that one group of 25,000 gets vis-a-vis the other 25,000. There are some very marked differences. Many of the people who are self-funded retirees have indeed been fortunate throughout their lives. They admit that. I recognise that. Many of them have held senior positions, or they have been self-employed and their businesses have been successful. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of retirees who are self-funded and independent because they have made many sacrifices throughout their lives; they have chosen to save and provide for their retirements. Many of them have had to make substantial sacrifices along the way so that they can be independent in their retirement. I often say to them that they should walk tall in the community because they stand unsupported by governments. I think that is a reason for pride, but unfortunately it is not enough these days. That is not going to be the total answer for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this special group of people do not access the public purse. They have not taken opportunities in the past to dissipate their assets in order to qualify for a pension, despite the obvious temptation to do so. In many ways the very system that we have in place in this country now encourages people to do that. It is alarming when one looks at the number of people in this country who are for one reason or another accessing social security benefits. There is a mentality that pervades the whole of Australian society whereby everybody looks to structure his affairs so that in some way he can get his little share of the action. I think that is most unfortunate. By the same token, I do not want to denigrate those Australians who are pensioners. As I say, in my electorate they are fairly much in equal numbers with the self-funded retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of those who are on pensions are quite legitimately taking what they are entitled to. Many of them lived and worked in times when there was not sufficient encouragement for people to provide for their own retirement. Of course, there is now an increased awareness that we need to encourage people to provide for their retirement. Whilst we have been very critical of the Government's methodology in doing that in a compulsory, heavy-handed way, we nevertheless agree that there is a need for people to be encouraged to provide for their own retirement. However, it should be recognised that self-funded retirees have done that, despite the lack of encouragement along the way, although, as I would be prepared to admit, it is often because they have worked in jobs where there were superannuation schemes available for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-funded retirees are now angry and their anger has intensified as a result of this Budget, which does absolutely nothing to address their concerns. Whilst falling interest rates&mdash;and this is the nub of their concern&mdash;have advantaged the vast majority of Australians, they have had a negative effect on self-funded retirees. The fact that many of them are now living on half of what they were living on before has severely disrupted their retirement lifestyles. That is a very real concern for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They understand perfectly well that there cannot be high interest rates for lenders and low interest rates for borrowers. This is in no way an argument that interest rates should go up to advantage self-funded retirees. As I have already said, low interest rates advantage the vast majority of people, and I strongly support a low interest rate regime. I hope that interest rates will stay low. I am concerned, incidentally, that there is now evidence in the marketplace that because of the Government's budgetary policies upward pressure is being placed on interest rates yet again. We have seen the havoc that has been created in the business community because of high interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of all of this is that many self-funded retirees have now been forced, for the first time in their retired lives&mdash;and many have been retired for 10, 15 or 20 years&mdash;to access social security. Already 10 per cent, or almost 3,000, of the 25,000 or so self-funded retirees on the Gold Coast are going into the social security net for the first time in their lives. I believe that the Government should be acting to enable self-funded retirees to remain outside the social security system. I have put it to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in writing, in detail, that the cost to the Government of facilitating that may well ultimately be less than the cost of paying pensions or part pensions. These people who are self-funded retirees actually save Australia millions and millions of dollars each year. I believe they should be congratulated and encouraged for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has been done for them? What was done for them in the Budget? In answer to a question without notice on 7 May 1992, the Treasurer added insult to injury by saying, in answer to a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), how much sympathy he had for those people who had suffered a decline in income. But these people do not want sympathy. They were incredibly insulted by what the Treasurer had to say. They do not want sympathy; they want action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These people have done their bit, but there are plenty of people in the community who do want jobs and cannot get them. The Treasurer went even further to insult this huge number of Australians. He had the gall to suggest that self-funded retirees had done well from high interest rates, so now they should not be complaining because they have to suffer low interest rates. That really added salt to the wounds. It led to quite an uproar within the community of self-funded retirees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly address what they do want. Let us look at how the self-funded retirees can be helped if the Government has the will to do it. They do not want charity; they simply want fair and equitable treatment under the tax system. I believe there is a very good case for equal treatment for all retired Australians under the tax system. The existing tax free threshold for pensioners is $10,278 single or $8,629 for each spouse, which totals $17,258. So a married pensioner couple have an effective tax free threshold of $17,258. A married superannuated couple have a tax free threshold of $5,400. That is an enormous disparity. In some cases, of course, self-funded retirees structure their affairs to split their incomes, but in many cases they are not able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of inequity relates to the availability of fringe benefits. I am not arguing in any way for the removal of fringe benefits from the pensioners&mdash;they deserve them. They have been effective in getting lots of fringe benefits, whether it be cuts in council rates, telephone accounts or whatever, and I support them. But once again it highlights the inequality in terms of low income self-funded retirees. There are some self-funded retirees in the community who are very wealthy people, and they are not concerned. This is not their argument; this is an argument on behalf of relatively poor self-funded retirees. The irony in this situation is that many of these people are substantially worse off than people who are on social security pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem is the assets test. The Government is aware of the problem, but once again it has done nothing. Falling property values have rendered the current assets test quite inappropriate. The assets test provides many self-funded retirees with an incentive to dispose of their assets. This is what seems to escape the Government's attention. The very system that has been in place has always encouraged people to get their snouts in the public trough wherever they can, and that is wrong. The current assets test is doing that in respect of many self-funded retirees. I do not disparage them in any way because the system allows them to do it. There is every incentive for them to do it. In fact, there is a necessity for them to do it if they are going to continue to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the assets test is set on the basis that a given stock of assets is capable of providing a certain stream of income. But circumstances have changed dramatically. Once again, thanks to this Government&mdash;and I do not use that word lightly, incidentally&mdash;assets which may have earned 10 per cent before the recession are now earning only 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put the case very much for the self-funded retirees and having assumed that the Government has done nothing and will do nothing, I think it is fair to contrast that with what the Opposition will do for self-funded retirees. We will raise the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000. We will give them very substantial income tax cuts with a reduction to the two lowest marginal tax rates from 38 per cent to 20 per cent and 30 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Tax credits will be available for them to subsidise private health insurance, which most of them have and desperately need. Pharmaceutical benefits cards will be extended to all people over 65 earning up to $50,000 per annum. There will be some compensation for the loss of value of savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we could go further. I believe there are compelling arguments for equal treatment for all retired Australians under the tax laws. I will continue to push that cause. My constituents expect me to do so, and I firmly believe that there is a very strong argument for that. But what has the Government done for self-funded retirees? I reiterate that it has done absolutely nothing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to one particular section of the Budget which is of great benefit to all Australians, and that is the continuing improvement of Australia's health system. The measures announced in the Budget go to the heart of meeting the health needs of all Australians. It does this without putting up health care costs by 22 per cent, as the Opposition plan would do, or by abolishing bulkbilling for all but the absolute poor. Rather, the Government bases its reforms on improving quality and extending access to health care for all Australians, not just those with private health cover.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is about improving the quality of general practice and medical care in Australia through the reforms announced in the Budget. These reforms build on the work of the past decade and continue to build a health system which is based on needs rather than on the ability to pay. The Government has developed a comprehensive health care program as opposed to the Liberal's anti-health debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform is essential to ensure our health system can meet the challenges of the next decade. By the year 2001 we will face a projected 24 per cent population increase and a 29 per cent increase in demand for hospital services. The challenge of increased demand will confront all parts of our health sector. There will be more patients in hospitals with acute health problems, more aged people with chronic health problems requiring community and residential care, and consequently greater call on general practitioners to handle these demands at a local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 Budget reform package is exciting because it has a clearer focus on an integrated health and aged care strategy. While individual reforms will boost service quality and structural reform within discrete parts of our health system, our objective is to achieve better coordination and continuity of care across health and aged care delivery. The Government has systematically and comprehensively identified areas for improvement in the health care system and has developed sensible and affordable measures addressing these areas. Further, we have outlined more ways of improving access, equity, efficiency and universality in the health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget's health package brings together the elements of the health care system that have traditionally been segregated, particularly GP services and primary health care, specialist and diagnostic services, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, hospital care administered by the States and Territories, community based care provided through HACC or the Medicare incentive program in the current hospital Medicare agreement related to aged care services, and mental health services. The reforms will improve the quality and efficiency of individual services, and improve planning, coordination and delivery across the health network. This approach is based on restructuring the system to best suit the needs of the users of the system, improving the quality and access without discrimination against public patients or those without health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has improved the health system by strengthening and further improving Medicare. This is the system that the Opposition wishes to eviscerate, the system which has the support of more than 70 per cent of Australians, the system which means one can be treated by a general practitioner or in a hospital and leave without being out of pocket. It is a system which has been able to restrain costs in the health care area while our population has been growing older and more dependent on the system. Medicare is the system which ensures that everyone is looked after, not just the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its introduction in 1984, Medicare has guaranteed access to public hospital services and other medical services. As well, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has provided access to essential medicines. Over this period the system has been based on the principles of universality, access, equity, efficiency, simplicity and fairness. The reforms announced in the Budget build on these fundamental principles. The reforms focus fairly on the consumer of health services and follow a 2 1/2-year review of the health system. The reforms will sustain Australia's health care system well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare package announced in the Budget is based on four different elements. Firstly, a hospital package costing $1.59 billion over the next six years; secondly, a general practice package containing an additional cost of $68.3m in 1992-93; thirdly, aged care reform costing $40m in 1992-93; and, fourthly, commencement of a new phase of health promotion programs, including the national drug strategy with $35.2m in 1992-92, and the national health advancement program with $6.1m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improved access is the key to the hospital reforms. These include immediate action on waiting lists as well setting in train fundamental reform to improve hospital management and access to treatment. The aim of the package is to introduce access to services based on clinical needs of patients and the identified needs of local populations, not according to financial status or the past inequitable distribution of services. These reforms assure improved access to hospital services, a more flexible general medical practice, better mental health services and more appropriate prescribing of pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget goes a long way towards reducing hospital waiting lists. As I said earlier, it will inject an additional $1.59 billion into hospital funding over the next six years&mdash;$1.23 billion of this will be spent on increasing public patient access by providing a bonus funding pool and by allocating these funds to ensure that the public hospitals increase access to public patients. There is $70.9m over the next two years for a targeted waiting list program, and in consultation with States and Territories the Government will develop a Medicare hospital patients charter which sets out people's entitlements under Medicare and effective mechanisms by which patients may make complaints. These initiatives will address the unacceptable waiting times in particular waiting specialties while allowing the underlying structural problems affecting public patient access to be examined and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to hospital services will be based on needs. At the moment this is far from the case. There will be a lot more money available for public hospitals&mdash;a total of $150m over six years. New arrangements will improve access and efficiency in the hospital sector by adopting a four-pronged approach. Firstly, the Government will act immediately on waiting lists through a targeted program which will require clinical and clerical validation of waiting lists, publish data on waiting times, address long waiting areas in clinical and geographic areas for elective surgery and find innovative ways to reduce waiting times such as contracting arrangements with private hospitals and expanding day surgery facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Government will introduce financial incentives for States and Territories to increase their provision of services for public patients. This means that from 1993-94 States will receive bonus payments based on their levels of public provision. Further, this Government will provide an immediate incentive for them to increase public access and will counter any incentive that they have now to prefer private patients over public patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Government will initiate structural reforms recommended by the national health strategy to ensure that the Australian health system is better able to cope with the demands of population growth, ageing and the increasing costs of medical technology. Finally, the Government will revise the new Medicare agreement to reinforce and protect the principles of Medicare and to safeguard the entitlements of public patients by enshrining Medicare principles in Commonwealth legislation, committing States to those principles and requiring them to enact complementary legislation. Further, we will be linking the agreement to the development of a Medicare hospital patients charter which will set out exactly what people can expect from their national health system and the establishment of consumer complaints mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of hospital waiting lists is a complex one, but it is simply not good enough for the Opposition to suggest that if we make private health insurance tax deductible the waiting lists will vanish. In this Budget there is a new era for general practice in Australia. Our reform strategy will end the professional isolation of GPs and help them lift standards of care for all of their patients. We will invest $17m to establish a network of divisions of general practice so that GPs have the sort of professional support that specialists currently have in hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will address the shortage of GPs in rural communities by investing $8m in a rural incentives package. We will give relocation grants to doctors who want to move to the country, and training grants to enhance their skills. We will introduce an independent general practice accreditation system to promote general practice of the highest quality. We will assist GPs in accredited practices to improve patient care through an $8m practice enhancement grants program, and we will strengthen the vocational registration arrangements to encourage doctors to undertake appropriate training before entering unsupervised general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health strategy which has been set out in this Budget has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, including the Australian Hospitals Association, which represents some 650 public and private hospitals around the country, the Doctors Reform Society, the Consumer Health Forum of Australia, the Public Health Association, and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. On 19 August 1992, the Consumer Health Forum of Australia said:</PARA>

<PARA>The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners had this to say about the Budget:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that, throughout the medical industry, most have supported the strategies outlined in the Budget and the reforms that have been contained within those strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now contrast the Government's program with some of the proposals that have been put forward by the Opposition. The Opposition in its Fightback package has proposed a slashing of funding to the public hospital system&mdash;in fact, a slashing of $1.3 billion from annual funding of public hospitals, which amounts to $6.5 billion less over the next five years for the public hospital sector in this country. Whereas this Government will invest an extra $1.6 billion over the next six years, the Opposition proposes to slash $6.5 billion off public health funding. Therefore there is an $8 billion difference in the amount of funding that this Government will contribute compared to what the Opposition will contribute. That is why I made the comment before that the Opposition's policy is an anti-health policy. It is certainly an anti-public health policy, because it is an attack on affordable health services to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition policy also threatens to blow out Australia's health spending by $2.1 billion a year. Under Medicare, this Government has presided over the most stable period of health costs in Australia's history. Health spending has been maintained at around 8 per cent of GDP. Under the Opposition, this stability would be destroyed and would lead us down the United States road, where health spending is heading towards 14 per cent of GDP and health services are denied to almost 40 million Americans who cannot afford private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must ask the question: why would we want Australia to travel down this path when we have a simple, stable, and affordable system in Medicare? The Opposition would jeopardise all of this to line the pockets of some doctors and private health insurers. It would mandate the AMA schedule of fees, which is 30 per cent higher than the Medicare benefits schedule, and even then doctors would be able to charge what they like, even above the AMA schedule. The key to Medicare's success is universal bulkbilling, which would be abolished by the Opposition, except for health care cardholders and welfare recipients. This would increase the up-front costs of going to the doctor for most people from zero to $31, because one has to pay one's bill before getting a rebate. Then there is the compulsory co-payment of at least $4.65 even if one does have private insurance and gap insurance. If one does not, one would be out of pocket by about $13, as the Medicare rebate is being cut from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the Medicare benefits schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly half of all Australian households spend nothing by way of out of pocket costs on basic medical and health services. For instance, nearly 70 per cent of all GP services are direct billed, meaning the patient incurs no cost and no out of pocket expenses. Under the Opposition, one would not be able to go to the doctor without having money in one's pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to contrast the policies of this Government, as demonstrated in the Medicare reform package in the Budget, to the Opposition's package. The size of our commitment is a signal of our determination that Australia will continue to have high quality care which is accessible to all, regardless of financial or insurance status. We are going to strengthen the Medicare principles of universality, access, equity, efficiency and simplicity to make sure that there is no discrimination against public patients, and to build a health system that is affordable. The Budget Medicare package shows the commitment of the Commonwealth to ensuring that the health needs of all Australians are met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already had occasion to discuss the 1992-93 Budget in the debate on the Supply and Loan Bills earlier today. As I observed then, this year the Government will preside over a declared Commonwealth Budget deficit of $13.389 billion, although the actual Budget deficit is probably more in the order of $16 billion to $21 billion when one discounts for some of the more dubious Budget transactions that serve to conceal the gap between tax revenue and government own-purpose spending. In addition, this year's Budget deficit implies a financing requirement of $18.5 billion in 1992-93. Between now and 1995 there is a financing requirement of $50 billion, which means that $50 billion in new debt will be issued by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in the debate on the Supply and Loan Bills, the Commonwealth is in dire financial straits. It is in this context that we debate the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) as a result of the 1992-93 Budget. For a government that is strapped for cash, many of the Government's Budget proposals are questionable, to say the least. One of the reasons the Government is so hard up for funds is the irresponsible pre-election spending that is in the Budget. The effects of the recession we had to have on Commonwealth tax receipts account for only some of the blow-out in the Budget deficit. The rest is attributable to some irresponsible spending initiatives and, most importantly, burgeoning public sector debt servicing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's irresponsible and thoughtless approach to expenditure restraint is well illustrated when we look at the defence portfolio. The Government has continued with a longstanding policy of making Budget cuts in the defence portfolio which have focused on cutting back combat capability while leaving virtually untouched the many non-combat functions within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total defence outlays will increase by 5.6 per cent in 1992-93, which represents zero real growth in outlays. The Government aims to reduce defence spending by nearly half of one per cent in real terms by 1993-94, from which point there is no projected real increase for the next three years. The coalition recognises that defence, along with all other portfolio areas, must share some of the burden of expenditure restraint in view of the current economic circumstances the Government has visited upon us. We do, however, have a great deal of difficulty with the Government's approach to expenditure reductions within the defence portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the half of one per cent cut in the defence budget projected for 1993-94 will be achieved by reducing combat capabilities, particularly by reducing regular troop numbers in the three Services. The Government is doing this at the same time as it presides over a vast defence bureaucracy that consumes an excessive amount of the resources the Commonwealth allocates to defence. The Government is either naive or misguided enough to believe the defence bureaucracy when it claims that cuts within that very same bureaucracy cannot be made. This is classic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> stuff which one would expect the Government, after all these years in office, to have developed some sort of immunity to. Apparently it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a disproportionate share of the defence vote allocated to support functions in the ADF itself. This is despite the rhetoric of the Government's own force structure review of May last year, which seeks to rationalise and reduce some of the defence vote devoted to these non-combat functions. The Government has only scratched the surface when it comes to reining in the defence bureaucracy and the non-combat elements of the defence forces. Instead, the Government's ongoing Budget cuts have invariably come off combat capabilities in one way or another. It is through reining in the defence bureaucracy and non-combat functions that the coalition plans to cut defence spending while at the same time enhance the ADF's combat capabilities to give us a more cost-effective Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition plans to implement some $500m worth of cuts to various defence functions, $300m worth of those cuts will be redeployed within the defence vote to give a net saving within the defence portfolio overall of some $200m. The Government, by contrast, is squandering the available defence dollars, which in the context of constrained budgetary conditions is totally inexplicable. The Government's spending cuts in the area of defence mean that it can no longer deliver on the funding or the force structure commitments made in the 1987 Defence White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper was based on the assumption of real growth in defence spending, virtually none of which has been delivered since the White Paper was first handed down in 1987. The implications of this for the Government's defence policy were spelled out in the Government's very own force structure review of May last year. The force structure review noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . should financial allocations fall below no real growth over the decade, few of the priority capital equipment programs could be funded. Such a reduced program would preclude the maintenance of a strategy of defence in depth as outlined in the paper, The Defence of Australia, 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has delivered the very budgetary conditions that only 18 months ago it said would undermine the strategy proposed in the 1987 Defence White Paper. The Government has supplied us with all the evidence necessary to pronounce the 1987 White Paper a defunct policy document that no longer serves as a useful guide to defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, strategic circumstances have changed to such a degree since 1987 that much of the strategic guidance in the White Paper is also no longer relevant. We have a defence policy that is pretty well adrift in terms of both policy guidance and the resources necessary to fund the capabilities that in the past the Government has said the ADF should have. An incoherent defence policy obviously has implications for the morale of Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADF members are as confused as anyone else about the direction defence policy has taken under this Government. It is difficult to contemplate a lifelong career in the ADF when the Government is manifestly under-providing for the ADF's current and future needs and has no clear policy guidance for the defence of Australia. The Government's defence policies generate far too much uncertainty to be relied on in this way. If ADF members cannot approach their career prospects with any confidence, they obviously start to think about their career prospects outside the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in the retention rate for the ADF is one of the biggest problems faced by the defence forces. A high turnover of ADF personnel means that we lose a lot of the skills and experience necessary to the combat capabilities of the ADF. Moreover, there is considerable expense to the Commonwealth entailed in recruiting, kitting out and training new members to replace those who leave the Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not make long term fiscal sense to be economising in the defence budget in such a way that the retention rate for the ADF is adversely affected. But when the Government starts cutting into combat capability instead of non-combat functions and the Defence bureaucracy, ADF members have every reason to fear for their future career prospects. They can see their career prospects being potentially curtailed by either present or future budget cuts. So the Government's approach to cutting back defence spending makes neither military nor fiscal sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another way in which the Government's actions fail to make sense, and that is in relation to Defence Force superannuation. As honourable members will be aware, ADF members must choose by 30 September whether they will remain with the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, the DFRDB, or change over to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme, the MSBS. I know that many honourable members will be familiar with this situation because so many have been receiving calls from Defence Force personnel seeking clarification of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision on whether to transfer to the new scheme should have been a relatively straightforward one since the two schemes have very different characteristics and will suit ADF members differently, depending on which point they are at in their military careers. But this Government has turned what should have been a relatively simple decision into a nightmare for many ADF members. For a start, it is clear that the information campaign run by the Department of Defence on this subject has failed to reach many ADF members. I do not know why, but from the large number of calls and letters I have received in my office, and from the large number of requests for assistance being made by ADF members to my coalition colleagues, it is clear that the Department's education campaign has failed to reach many ADF members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had ADF members up to the rank of Air Commodore contact my office in complete ignorance of the nature of the decision they had to make because they had not received any or adequate information on the subject from the Department of Defence. This was despite the fact that all members of the DFRDB scheme were meant to receive a kit of information and a wide range of other assistance from Defence to help them make their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision ADF members have to make has been even further complicated by several actions of the Government, which have caused a great deal of needless anguish on the part of defence personnel and their spouses. First, the Government has failed to resolve in a timely manner the question of redundancies in the ADF under the Government's force structure review. Because the Government has had difficulties in meeting its redundancy targets, there have been extensive delays in issuing new posting orders and promotions. These delays mean that some ADF members will not know of their new postings or promotions until after the 30 September deadline.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be obvious that this information can be crucial for an ADF member in deciding whether, or for how long, to remain in the ADF, which in turn is crucial in making a decision about which super scheme would be most appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other difficulty ADF members have faced has been the Government's dithering on whether the DFRDB would be exempt from the new super rules. The Government's superannuation statement of 30 June made a number of changes to the preservation rules for superannuation benefits generally. In the past, it has been the usual practice for the DFRDB scheme to be made exempt from the preservation rules applicable to other superannuation schemes because of the unique retirement needs of ADF personnel. Very few ADF personnel stay with the forces until the age of 55 or 60. Moreover, they need to be able to access a proportion of their retirement benefits so that they may establish a career outside the ADF or maybe purchase a home, since home ownership can often be impractical for ADF members while they are in service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of these unique retirement needs, it has been the usual practice to exempt the DFRDB from the requirements imposed on other superannuation schemes. Indeed, the Government has in the past given a number of guarantees to the effect that the DFRDB would continue to be entitled to special consideration, and the DFRDB review committee that put together the new MSBS made it clear that it based its recommendations on these guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1989, the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, now the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), in his ministerial statement announcing the review, had this to say, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government gives an ironclad guarantee to those presently in service that the benefits of the existing DFRDB scheme for which they are contributing will remain available to be taken up when they leave the Services.</PARA>
<PARA>It became apparent, however, that in the wake of the Government's superannuation statement of 30 June there are moves afoot in Government circles to refuse the DFRDB scheme the usual exemption. There was conflict within the Commonwealth bureaucracy and within the Department of Defence on this matter, which has meant that the usual granting of an exemption at the request of the DFRDB Authority has been unduly delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can understand that there might be some reasonable amount of time taken in the making of this decision, but the Government should at least have given an undertaking to make a decision by a certain date&mdash;preferably well before the 30 September deadline&mdash;so that ADF members could plan accordingly. Instead, we have had nothing but silence from the Government on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite calls from the Armed Forces Federation, the RSL and me for the Government to make a decision in favour of exempting the DFRDB, the Government has just left the matter hanging in the air. I would ask honourable members to put themselves in the shoes of an ADF member trying to make a decision about which super scheme to join by 30 December. To make things easy, let us assume that he has received his latest posting or promotion, which, as I said before, may not be the case, he is aware of the new superannuation rules and wonders how they might affect his benefits under the DFRDB scheme. He makes some inquiries with the DFRDB Authority and discovers that the matter is yet to be resolved. No-one can tell him whether it will be resolved one way or the other, and no-one can tell him whether a decision is likely to be announced, or even whether it will be made before 30 September. What does this person do? He has no way of making a fully informed decision, and can only hope that the necessary information will be made available before he has to make a potentially very costly choice between one scheme or the other by 30 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation that ADF personnel have faced over the past few months. Clearly, this is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Government has simply failed in its obligation to make essential information available to ADF members in a timely way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an answer to a question in the Senate on Tuesday, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said that this matter was close to a resolution. Well, 30 September is close to a resolution, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have since been indications that a decision to exempt DFRDB was actually taken on Monday, which conflicts slightly with Senator Ray's answer that the matter was close to resolution. Either way, there has still been no formal announcement from the Government on this matter, which I find totally inexplicable if a decision was in fact made on Monday, as has been suggested in some quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If and when a decision is made, it should be formally announced and publicised immediately so that ADF members can get on with making the important decisions they need to make, albeit before 30 September, which is now far too short a period. In any event, the Government stands condemned for letting the matter drag on to this very late stage. It shows an amazing disregard for the welfare and interests of ADF members who have been made to suffer while the bureaucrats fight over a matter which the Government has previously said was ironclad. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I implore the people of Australia to read page 13 of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. In a very penetrating article entitled `Who's who in Hewson's demonology', Gerard Henderson analyses the psyche of the Leader of the Opposition. Readers will be forgiven for feeling that John Hewson has a death wish for this nation. Mike Seccombe says that Dr John possesses a messiah complex. Peter Smark has a chuckle at Dr Hewson's expense. Should the Leader of the Opposition be run over by a bus, in the hiatus period we would have a distinguished leader of the opposition, would we not?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members of his own Party are anxious about Hewson's megalomania. They fear the consequences of his obsession with the goods and services tax. They fear his preparedness to allow the honourable member for Bennelong free rein with a draconian industrial relations policy. There are decent men within the coalition parties who are less adamant than their Leader. They do not want the average Australian worker who is standing tall at the moment to be slammed into the ground by a goods and services tax. They do not want the average Australian worker to be hit by a double whammy&mdash;the Opposition's industrial relations policy. They do not want the Australian worker to be crippled because they know that the average Australian family will not be able to afford the coalition's extra $25 per week health charges. </PARA>

Why on earth does it want to destroy Medicare and replace it with a service that lower and middle class Australians will not possibly be able to afford? The Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the Budget, tried to paint a picture of Labor being the enemy of wealth. There is no truth at all in his claims. Labor appreciates the necessity for wealth to build the factories to create jobs, but we do not believe in an unfair accumulation of wealth&mdash;a wealth which feeds off the flesh not only of the battlers of Australia but also of the middle classes. Labor does not support the type of wealth which the Liberals and Nationals intend handing over to the doctors by virtually allowing them to charge whatever fee they want.

The Leader of the Opposition has never pretended that what he proposes is popular, and that is entirely to his credit.

The great thing about standing on this side of the Parliament is that one has the responsibility to speak up for all those people who did not elect the Government.

If I wanted to make a cheap political point, I would blame the Prime Minister; if I wanted to offer any integrity in this debate, I would have to concede that the Prime Minister, the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Victoria, and sundry and assorted business entrepreneurs have all made a contribution to that Budget blow-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that no-one disputes that it is time for a change of direction in Australia. After nine years of this administration, people fear most of all that they are inheriting a Budget which will be passed on to their children. Far from seeking to be elected, the Opposition is saying, `Here is a change of direction. Here is what we propose to do. We know it is unpopular; we know there are people who will be disadvantaged by it', but they are not all those in the lower socio-economic group alluded to by the honourable member for Hunter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members thumb through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> speeches on this appropriation debate, I am sorry to say that they will find comment after comment made by those opposite that simply refers, as the honourable member for Hunter did, to a 15 per cent extra tax on everything that every Australian will consume. That is a blatant untruth. Forget about the Liberal Party's calculations, forget about the National Party's calculations, there is no way that the Treasury can suggest that the result of a Fightback package will be a 15 per cent increase in price. Why? Because we propose to remove seven taxes; six currently existing taxes. We make no bones about the fact that the coal export duty has gone and that the customs duty is an incidental one, as alluded to by the Prime Minister today. We do not even make a great fuss about the changes we would make to lump sum super tax, and we do not make a great fuss about what we would do to the training guarantee levy, although we would do it without apology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been saying to Australians that we will remove sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax. As a result of the impact of those taxes, as they cascade through the present Australian capitalist system, the real effect of removing those taxes and denying incoming Treasurer Reith $35 billion will mean that an additional 15 per cent goods and services tax&mdash;an additional $27m he collects&mdash;would not raise prices by more than about 5 per cent. That is Neil Andrew's arithmetic; it would be 3.8 per cent if Treasury's figures are used; and 4.4 per cent if the Fightback figures are used.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be happy to respond to that but, since we do not know what the Government is doing, I think it is inappropriate for either the honourable member or me to comment on that. Flour is being delivered to the Tip Top bakery in a cheaper form and all the Tip Top employees are now running around the bakery that no longer incurs a payroll tax; Mr Tip Top fires his oven with diesel that no longer incurs an excise; he wraps his bread up in wrapping that no longer has a sales tax on it; and out the other end of the factory he plonks it in a Tip Top van that no longer has a sales tax on it or a sales tax on its spares parts, is driven by a little Tip Top man or lady on whom he would no longer pays payroll tax and is powered by fuel on which he no longer pays a fuel excise. The real impact of the GST on that food would be something like 5 per cent and not 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, more than that, let us say that we exempt food. Let us say that because it would be politically popular&mdash;and the honourable member might remember that in his speech he said we were using every deceit to worm our way into office&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition decided that he was prepared to exempt food. What would he do then? He would say to Australia's largest businessmen who may currently choose&mdash;and I am not offended by this&mdash;to dine every night at a silver plate restaurant, `You will not pay tax on that service and that meal'. Under a GST those who dine at silver plate restaurants pay considerably more than those who are unable to do so. There is a measure of equity in that which the honourable member failed to concede. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, we looked at the whole issue of what to do with a tax on food. We looked at the Canadian experience where exempting food has been a disaster. So we have avoided it in spite of the political unpopularity of the issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said that one of the dreadful things about the coalition is the way in which we would model our tax policy and our industrial relations policy&mdash;in fact, he emphasised industrial relations&mdash;on the Bolger experience in New Zealand. I have been to New Zealand. I was there three weeks ago. I made it my business to visit industries in New Zealand, to wander up and down the shopping malls and to talk to the welfare agencies such as the Salvation Army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did I discover about business in New Zealand? I talked to one employer in Christchurch who also happens to run a factory in Melbourne, so he provided a very useful comparison. He said, `We would not change the GST; it's so simple. But it is a non-issue for us. The one thing that has made New Zealand strong is enterprise bargaining'. He said, `Here I am with a factory in Christchurch and a factory in Melbourne. My on-cost&mdash;it is nothing to do with what my employees get, of course; it has only to do with what it costs me to employ them&mdash;is 19c in the dollar in New Zealand and my on-cost in Melbourne is 53c in the dollar. Where do you think I am expanding? Where do you think I am running an extra shift? Where do you think the employment opportunities are currently? Where do you think my people are in the strongest position to negotiate a better package?'. It was in Christchurch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening in New Zealand? In spite of the comments made by the Premier of Victoria, for the third month in a row New Zealand has a balance of payments surplus&mdash;the very thing that we need most. I am not suggesting, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) is not suggesting, and the Leader of the Opposition is not suggesting that our proposal is somehow comfortable and that Australians will instantly grasp it. But I will not wear the nonsense that the honourable member for Hunter has paraded in here, suggesting that we would get into office only by worming our way in with every deceit. We have been up-front and if in fact we get into office every Australian will know precisely what we propose to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at another issue in the few minutes that are left to me. Let us look at tariffs. It has been so convenient and so easy for the Government to deride the Opposition over its tariff policy, but no-one has paused to consider&mdash;as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) insisted during the discussion of the MPI this afternoon&mdash;that there is very little difference between the Government's attitude to tariffs and the Opposition's attitude to tariffs. In fact, between now and 1996 it will be easier to be an employer in Australia under our policy than under that of the Government. By the year 2000 what will be the difference? At most, for two industries it is the difference between 5 per cent and 15 per cent if nothing happens at all. The policy is the same for all other industries. Our policy at the year 2000 is negligible, and for two industries nominated by the Government the maximum one could extract would be a 10 per cent difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we propose to do for employers relative to what the Government proposes to do? We propose to give them the sort of industrial relations climate that currently exists in New Zealand. We do not want to tear down centralised wage fixing; it will remain. But those who choose to negotiate outside it will be able to do so, just as the New Zealanders do. Are we supposed to apologise for that? Of course we are not. But imagine how it riles me to sit here and watch the Prime Minister pretend that there is something dramatically different between my policy and his; that in some way we are supposed to be poles apart. I am in Opposition. It is far easier for me to be critical of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of that, over the last four years at least&mdash;for as long as the Government has had this policy&mdash;at the cost of a good deal of electoral popularity we have chosen to defend the Government on the tariff front. One could not say that for all political parties in Australia. But it would not hurt the Prime Minister to be gracious enough to concede that an Opposition which could have easily exploited his tariff stance has been prepared to defend it. But is there any gracious remark of that sort from the Prime Minister? It is hard to imagine any remark like that even passing his lips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was so proud of this Appropriation Bill when it offered to Australians, particularly the unemployed, $350m for job creation. I do not have much to complain about in that regard: my electorate picked up $4.5m. So there is no way in which the Government could be accused of having ignored an Opposition electorate like mine. Why did I get that money? I got it because, sadly, I have a relatively high proportion of unemployed people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if that is not bad enough, I am in another great bind. That is, if people are unemployed in Wakefield and they live in the town of Clare there is no money for them, but if they are unemployed in Wakefield and live in the town of Peterborough there is money for them. If people are unemployed in Wakefield and live in the town of Kadina there is money for them, but if they live in the town of Maitland there is no money for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is hardly a just policy.

I do not pretend&mdash;and neither does the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;that there is any nice, easy, simple way to create full time employment. We have not pretended that unemployment would fall dramatically under us, but we have put together a difficult but responsible package which, frankly, gives unemployed Australians the first opportunity they will have to see jobs at the end of the tunnel because it makes Australia efficient and productive for the first time in the last decade. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carrying on that theme, maybe we should step back from the conflict which is often apparent in Budget debates and look at what is common between the Government and Opposition in terms of economic approach. I think the first and most important common point between us is that both the Government and Opposition clearly see that unemployment is the single biggest issue confronting Australia economically. It is the issue to which the Government and Opposition, and indeed the entire Australian community, should be turning their primary attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second point on which the Government and the Opposition agree is that for Australia's long term future there has to continue to be a very fundamental shift in the way in which our economy is based. We can no longer be so reliant on the export of primary products and commodities such as minerals; we have to be an economy which is far more broadly based. A lot more value adding has to be conducted in Australia and there has to be a much stronger manufacturing system and a much stronger services system. I do not think there is any disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third point which would obviously be fundamental and common to all members of this House is that economic policy is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. We debate economic policy and different approaches for the common goal of improving Australia, improving the living standards of all Australians and the quality of life and the opportunities which all Australians have. Our point of difference is not those goals, but the means by which we use our economy in order to achieve those goals. It is useful to recall that in those fundamental areas there is much more which joins us in this Parliament than divides us. That is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against those three tests I would like to contrast the different approaches that have been proposed by the Government in its Budget and by the Opposition in its Fightback policy. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield again that we have in the Fightback policy the most comprehensive attempt on behalf of an Opposition, at least in recent years, to put forward to the Australian people a fully explained program for them to judge. Maybe Gough Whitlam, in terms of the very extensive program he put to the Australian people in 1972, could also claim to have had a very extensive policy, but in 1972 the focus was not on economics quite as much as it is today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's No. 1 goal is to tackle unemployment. We have tragic levels of unemployment in this country. There is no debate whatsoever about that. Let me put it in perspective. Let us look at what happened over the last decade. The reality is that during the 1980s Australia's employment growth was very strong. That is not a question of debate; it is a fact. During that period something like 1.8 million Australians obtained work, either part time or full time. During this recession a few hundred thousand people have tragically lost their jobs. That is why our closest attention is on unemployment. But the fact remains that in 1992 something like 1.4 million more Australians are in work than there were in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I tell people that, they say, `How can that be? Unemployment is 11 per cent. Surely there must be more people out of work or the work force has reduced'. It has not. Because of the significant change in the participation rate of the Australian economy, along with our major economic changes, there has been a major social change in Australia, common with most Western economies. That means there are more people out of the total population who either are in work or consider themselves part of the paid labour force. That is largely reflected in the changed career patterns of Australian women. The vast bulk of those 1.8 million jobs created in the 1980s went to Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have high levels of unemployment, but we have a much larger work force today, something like 1.4 million people. In 1992 the Australian economy, our gross domestic product, is some 30 per cent larger than it was in 1982. So it is a little misleading. We can get caught up. We think Australia must have shrunk or there must have been an endless recession. That is not the reality at all. The Australian economy throughout most of the decade has grown quite strongly and is some 30 per cent larger. Our collective cake is 30 per cent larger than it was a decade ago. Those are important things to understand, but we do have a high unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the Government's response to that? This is where there is a very fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition. While both the Government and the Opposition accept that Australia is a mixed economy, that is, we have a mix of private sector activity and Government enterprises and a role for government, what we think are the appropriate roles for government and the private sector is quite different. The Government's approach in this Budget and earlier in the One Nation statement has been to expand the role of government. That is the fundamental thing. We can say, `Where has the money gone?'. Whether it has gone into a local government capital works program, into a better cities program, or into other specific line departments, the fundamental response of the Government has been to increase the size of government spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been roundly criticised on this point by the Opposition. We are told that by having a Budget deficit of $13 billion we are being fiscally irresponsible, that we are mortgaging the country and that we are going to load our children with debt. I think the honourable member for Wakefield suggested that our children would be carrying the debt of the current generation. He was speaking more in terms of the foreign debt. But the reality is that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s, when the private sector was moving along quite nicely and when employment growth was strong and investment was strong, the Australian Government pulled back the size of the public sector involvement. For the first time in this country's history we ran a series of Budget surpluses. That was the appropriate response at the time because we had a booming private sector. It was not appropriate in an economic model for the Government to be also in there spending away madly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have exactly the reverse situation. We have a very sluggish private sector, a private sector which in some industries is obviously still contracted; and the appropriate response, at least on behalf of the Government, is for it to increase demand by spending more. That is exactly what it has done. The Government has not said, `Look, it is all on the never-never; we are going to be on $13 billion for time everlasting'. In order to return Australia to a position of a reduced Budget deficit the Government has committed itself to getting back to a balance or surplus position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk about being deceitful and trying to worm our way into government, which occupied part of the last two speeches. The same thing could be said to the Government. We were honest enough in the Budget statement to say that we will look at the withholding tax system and at the prescribed payment system a couple of years down the track if we find that the Budget is not returning quickly enough to a balance position. There is nothing deceitful or underhand about that, despite the attacks along the lines that there is some sort of secret tax agenda. Obviously, there is not. It would be a secret tax agenda if nothing at all were said or mentioned in the Budget Papers; if it had to be wormed out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing secret about the amount&mdash;I accept the interjection&mdash;in that we are talking about Budgets which will be decided two or three or four years down the track. We all know what difficulties there are in putting together estimates even 12 months down the track. With the One Nation statement and the Budget we seem to have some difficulty four months down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is slightly unreasonable for the Opposition to say, `You should be able to tell us now exactly what is going to be happening with these provisions some four years down the track'. Like the Opposition's proposals in the Fightback policy, this is an honest attempt to state that we will be looking at these measures and that we have a very real commitment to return Australia to a situation where the Budget is put back in balance. But we accept at this stage that the tragedy of unemployment is such that we cannot stand idle; we cannot say, `Well, that's too bad. You're unemployed. We're very sorry about that, but we are not going to do anything about it'. The Government is quite committed to increasing the role of government to overcome the deficiency in private sector demand. That is why the Government has taken that course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to that, the Opposition, in its replies to the Budget and more particularly in its Fightback proposals, is proposing to cut government spending. It is saying that the public sector should be wound back and that there should be less spending by the Government. That is supposed to be the philosophy which will lead to increases in overall employment. I have never quite understood&mdash;and maybe subsequent speakers will explain it to me&mdash;how that can be. That certainly is not conventional economic rational thought in my view. I can understand that, if the private sector were booming, the Government would compete for investment and savings; that if the Government called on savings it would be denying them to the private sector. I can understand it then, but one can hardly claim at the moment that we have a boundless private sector kicking on; it is obviously very sluggish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like it explained to me. I am only a simple back bench member of the Parliament. Maybe the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) will take up the challenge and explain how it is appropriate at this stage for the Government to knock off something like $6 billion or $7 billion in government spending and say that that will lead to an improvement in the employment position. If we are truthful and honest, we will realise that if a government adopted those policies in the current economic conditions it would lead to greater levels of unemployment. The economy would shrink, there would not be any demand at all and we would go back into a recession where the economy slows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up another point raised by the honourable member for Wakefield. He gave the example of Tip Top in his electorate. He went through the various stages in the production of bread&mdash;the trucks coming and picking it up and what have you, and finally getting it to the supermarket. He concluded that from this chain of things&mdash;putting taxes on and taking taxes off, and not charging fuel excise but putting a GST on instead&mdash;the net result would be about a 5 per cent increase in the cost of a loaf of bread. I think he is a bit wrong about that. For instance, most of the taxes on vehicles, spare parts and what have you are 20 per cent at the wholesale level. He is talking about putting on a 15 per cent retail tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if there were a significant reduction in petrol prices, we have no idea what would happen with the road user charges, except that the Opposition has said that it is committed to a policy of road user charges. We have no details yet of how that will be implemented, but one must assume that there would be some cost imposed somewhere. Road user charges mean the people on the road are actually paying. If they are not paying through the bowser, one assumes they are paying through registration or some other system along those lines. From the figures that I have seen produced by the Opposition, I think the truthful outcome of the old loaf of bread example from Tip Top is that that particular item will probably be rising not by about 5 per cent but by something like 10 or 11 per cent. That 5 per cent increase is on things like deodorants and cleaning items. They do become cheaper and the 5 per cent would even out between the things which go up and the things which come down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield then went on to expand on the New Zealand experience. He said that Australia could learn a bit from New Zealand. He compared the positions of two companies, one in New Zealand and one in Melbourne. I really hope that New Zealand is seeing some benefit after going through a period where its economy has shrunk. The New Zealand economy now is smaller&mdash;it is not that its growth has been slow or anything like that&mdash;than it was at the beginning of the 1980s. One would hope that after all the pain it has gone through it might now be seeing some benefit flowing from it. While the New Zealand economy has got smaller, the Australian economy has grown by about 30 per cent; that is, while our domestic product is 30 per cent greater than it was at the beginning of the 1980s, the New Zealand economy is actually smaller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If New Zealand is such a great place for workers, employment and good wages and conditions, I wonder why so many New Zealanders seem to be voting with their feet and coming over to Australia to look for work. Why is it that New Zealand shearers are here in great numbers? I suggest it is because the wage levels in Australia are considerably better than they are in New Zealand. There are considerably better conditions in Australia and that is why people from New Zealand are voting with their feet and coming over here. If the Opposition is talking about overcoming that disparity, I do not think it is talking about raising New Zealand standards, conditions and wages to the Australian level; it is probably talking about lowering the Australian conditions, standards and wages to the New Zealand level.</PARA>

I can judge people only as I see them. And I see an opposition which has opposed every national wage decision essentially during the 1980s&mdash;that is, opposing people's wage increases&mdash;and which at the same time has always advocated a wages system based on productivity, and that has always meant that wage levels would become considerably lower. I would be quite amazed if members of the Liberal Party honestly tried to tell us that their industrial relations policy was designed to increase wage costs in Australia and that its end result would be to increase wage levels and working conditions.

Instead of concentrating on the causes of our economic problems and developing constructive and real, long term solutions to those problems, it has opted yet again for the quick fix solutions, which will do precious little to stem the swelling tide of unemployed and even less to overcome the fundamental deficiencies in our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is no different from those in the past. The only thing that has changed is the rhetoric. We no longer have the Budget that is going to bring home the bacon, but we are supposed to have the caring Budget. The terminology would be almost farcical if it were not such a serious matter, but there is nothing caring about this Budget. The end result of the policies of this Government and the Budget is record unemployment and making more people more dependent on government for their very survival. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is caring about that? It is a tragedy that more and more people are having to depend on government assistance through no fault of their own, whether they be on unemployment benefit because they have lost their job or, in the case of young people, because they simply cannot get a start in life, or whether they have jobs but pay so much tax that they have to rely on government assistance to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government and this Budget deny Australians the opportunity to independently fulfil their basic needs of housing, feeding, clothing, educating and nurturing the members of their family unit. What Australians really want is the opportunity to provide for themselves and not to be increasingly dependent on government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most critical problem facing us as a country is the distressing unemployment crisis.

Yet, despite that, officially one million Australians are out of work, 680,000 children are living in homes where neither parent has a job, and those numbers are increasing by more than 500 a day. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are able to find only part time work, and many more are worried about losing their jobs or their loved ones losing theirs.

The nation's foreign debt has climbed past $150 billion after expanding almost six times more quickly than the general economy during the past financial year. In fact, our net foreign debt now takes up 40 per cent of our gross domestic product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the real picture of Australia today, and this is what this Government had the responsibility to address with its Budget. The Budget provided it with the opportunity to tackle the causes of the unemployment crisis and the 144 per cent increase in business bankruptcies. However, just as the Government deliberately chose to maintain high interest rates, it chose to keep drifting&mdash;at our expense. The Prime Minister has refused to acknowledge that there are very serious problems with the economic structure in which we must all operate, whether that be running our own businesses or working for others who provide employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of tackling the problems that are forcing thousand of businesses either to cut back on working hours or to close their doors, the Prime Minister chose a very short term cosmetic program. The Budget contains little good news for most sectors of the Australian community and in particular for farmers and rural communities, who are suffering from falling income and the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently released statistics from the ABS national agriculture finance survey 1990-91 show, the rural economy is in a perilous state. Farm incomes are down by one-third, cash operating surplus is down by 36 per cent nationally and 40 per cent in Victoria, farm capital expenditure is down nationally by 36 per cent and again in Victoria by 40 per cent. All of those figures combine to paint a gloomy but, unfortunately, realistic picture of life on the land. As I drive through country towns in my electorate of McEwen, I see all too clearly the evidence of the damage that this Government's policies have done to the rural sector. Shop after shop, business after business, dealer after dealer are either empty, closing down or have laid off staff. These businesses have been forced to close their doors and put off their staff because they simply cannot afford to operate in an economic climate where business costs are too high and demand is stagnant or declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these hardships, rural communities and farmers are to get no relief from this Government. Instead, the situation may get worse. It is predicted that as many as one in five farmers will leave the land during the next five years. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS>, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has warned rural counsellors around the nation to prepare themselves for major structural change. Counsellors have been told that there is a potential worst case scenario of 20 per cent of farmers leaving the land&mdash;the biggest demographic shake out in memory. The flow-on effect this will have on small country towns will be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation has said that the Government has chosen a short term job fix rather than the creation of permanent jobs through sustained economic growth in this latest Budget. The Budget does not remove the high add-on costs or tackle the problems that make our exports, including our primary products, uncompetitive on the world market. We need to encourage production and encourage our farmers to export. To do that we need to remove the cost burdens that make our products uncompetitive, and only Fightback will do that. Only the Fightback plan will give farmers and rural communities the relief they so desperately need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Treasury analysis has confirmed this. It has found that under the Fightback plan costs in the agricultural sector would fall by $1 billion and costs in the transport and storage sector would fall by $2 billion. Further support of the benefits of Fightback comes from the NFF's independent study of the Fightback plan undertaken by ACIL Australia Ltd. It found that the savings for farm businesses range from 8 to 29 per cent if there was no road user charge, and from 7 to 22 per cent with a road user charge, on which the Government must make up its mind, and that farm families with low incomes would benefit by up to 11 per cent, while the real disposable incomes of families in higher income groups would increase by about 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility of this Government to provide the economic environment in which business can thrive and develop, but this Government has abrogated its responsibility in relation to the business community. Businesses&mdash;indeed, all of us&mdash;have been let down by this Keating Government because it refuses to show the resolve to tackle the causes of our current problem and refuses to make the changes necessary to reform our economic structure and allow us to take our place among the top modern, competitive trading nations and, most importantly, help create secure and long term jobs for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that massive potential for job creation and growth in small business, there was not one mention of small business in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and there was nothing in the Budget Papers to encourage business to employ or invest. Already, business investment is one of the weakest sections of the economy. Statistics show that it has fallen by more than a quarter in the past two years, and the Budget Papers forecast another fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's policies make it expensive for employers to employ people. In Victoria it is estimated that employers are paying almost $4,000 a year in administration costs on each employee. Businesses are further hampered by a restrictive taxation system which burdens them with excessive add-on costs such as payroll tax, sales tax, fuel tax and training tax, to name just a few.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could dramatically cut unemployment levels by abolishing payroll tax alone. The Prime Minister himself said that the abolition of payroll tax would create between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had the opportunity to take this action with its Budget, but yet again it frittered away the opportunity and ignored the plight of those hundreds of small businesses in my electorate of McEwen who are struggling for survival through this recession.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only to pick up a copy of one of my local newspapers to see that yet another business has shut down in my electorate. The local paper in Yea recently ran an article highlighting the number of businesses that have been forced to close.

For many small businesses this wage increase may well be the last straw which pushes them over the edge into closure or bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I am most asked by businesses in my electorate is when will they get relief from the crushing level of add-on costs they are forced to pay now. This Budget has demonstrated that this Government has absolutely no answer for them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the level of youth unemployment, especially in rural and outlying urban areas, such as Craigieburn and Epping in my electorate, it was to be hoped that the Government would take some real action on this problem. But rather than try to tackle the causes of youth unemployment, the Government has once again chosen to disguise the causes of the problem by throwing more handfuls of money into training programs which in the past have had poor or dubious outcomes&mdash;spending, yet again, what it does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Jobtrain program, Labor's own figures show that in 1991 only 22 per cent of young people who actually completed a Jobtrain course were employed three months after completing Jobtrain. Additionally, one-third of those who enrolled for Jobtrain courses drop out before they are completed. In this Budget the Government has provided for a range of temporary make-work schemes and training programs costing $3 1/2 billion. These measures are entirely cosmetic exercises aimed at reducing the unemployment queues by shifting the young into education or training schemes. Sadly, there is no guarantee that any of those involved with these schemes will have a job at the end of their training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the lack of resolve of this Government to really address the causes of our unemployment can be seen in its decision to spend millions of dollars on short term job creation schemes, the major one being the local capital works program. No-one objects to local facilities being upgraded or extended, but what happens to those who get some short term employment, when the money runs out? Once again, by not tackling the causes of our problems, the problems will not only continue to exist but they will get worse. Would it not be more honest and make more sense to tackle the causes of the problems now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has presided over the worst unemployment in this country's living memory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing aspects of the Budget is that with it the Government has embarked on a massive unfunded spending spree which will do precious little to help our unemployment crisis and nothing to overcome the fundamental problems in our economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already under the present Prime Minister we have witnessed one of the greatest fiscal turnarounds this country has ever seen. In two years the Government has gone from a forecast Budget surplus of $8 billion to an official deficit for 1992-93 of $13.4 billion. As I sat listening to the Treasurer on Budget night when he was making his Budget Speech, I had a distinct whiff of the Kirner Government, because this Federal Labor Government is spending money it does not have and selling assets to reduce its Budget deficit. We have heard and seen that many times in Victoria under Cain and Kirner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has even admitted that the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to reduce the 1995 Budget deficit, which has been increased in order to fund the spending spree. In short, the Government will impose massive increases in taxes and charges to pay for this year's and last year's unfunded spending spree. Already we have had increases in the Medicare levy, tobacco excise and fringe benefits tax. It is the responsibility of government to provide a framework for business, industry and consumers of this country in which they can be dynamic and innovative. This Government has certainly failed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to remain for the coalition when it forms the government to introduce those changes which are so desperately needed in this country. All it takes is determination, courage and commitment. We have an example of that determination and commitment: firstly, to admit that we have real problems in this country; secondly, to identify the causes of those problems; and thirdly, to strategically set about fixing those problems. A small country across the Tasman has already faced up to its responsibilities. I might add that it was a Labour government that initiated the changes and showed that courage and determination. </PARA>

I am sure that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) goes and there is a change of leadership there will quickly be a watering down of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that there are councils within the electorate of the honourable member for McEwen that would gratefully receive the funding under the capital works program. I am the first to admit that unemployment is unacceptably high. The unemployment level in this country is a real tragedy, but it is a worldwide phenomenon, unfortunately. We are in a world recession. The tragedy is that we are not able to get away from unemployment. It is a fact of life. I think it is indeed a tragedy. I have not heard anything from the Opposition that would certainly create constructive employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of things that I want to speak about. One of them is that in the recent Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) it was very disappointing that once again people who have taken out private medical and hospital insurance received no recognition, return or benefit from this Government for this financial sacrifice. If the bureaucrats who advise the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) believe that it is only the wealthy in our society who take out private health coverage they are wrong. In the working class cities and towns of my electorate, ordinary people&mdash;pensioners, blue-collar workers and other battlers&mdash;overwhelmingly take out medical insurance which, in most cases, they can ill-afford but choose to do so because of the fear of being denied adequate hospital or specialist treatment in their hour of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be perfectly honest: there are long delays in the public hospitals for such things as hip replacements, breast reductions and other surgery, although these operations can be done immediately in private hospitals if one has private medical cover, as the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, would testify. It is ironic that the very people who oppose the private health insurance scheme because they can afford it are in the scheme on the highest table in case they or their family need urgent medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I firmly believe that if anybody, as a priority, is prepared to make a financial sacrifice to take out health insurance, a tax rebate is more than appropriate and is fair and reasonable. If we do not do this, more and more people will drop out of private health schemes and the whole system can only become chaotic. I agree that it is imperative to retain Medicare and continually improve it, but let us not be so bloody-minded as to not reward those who make sacrifices to take out private cover. I urge the Minister for Health, and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in particular, to initiate the necessary changes to allow tax rebates for people taking out private health coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are all aware what would happen if, unfortunately, the coalition were to win government. It would most certainly be the end of Medicare, and we would go back to the previous conservative government period when people gambled on their health and two million people had no health cover at all, which would be totally unacceptable in our democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I represent some 91 per cent of South Australia, which covers a land mass of 895,000 square kilometres, I am well aware of some of the unique difficulties rural and regional Australians face. Australia is the most highly urbanised country in the world. It has the most highly concentrated, unevenly distributed and, for its land area, the smallest population. Along with Canada, it also has the lowest overall population density and vast areas of extreme sparsity, making servicing rural and especially the more remote parts of the continent difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partly because of this, rural Australia is disadvantaged on a number of social and economic fronts. One area, of course, is that of tertiary and higher education, which I have spoken about many times in this House. What normally happens is that people who are denied Austudy when living in the country have to virtually set up a second home in cities so that their children can go on to higher education. I think that is an outrageous situation. I believe that if anybody lives within something like a 100 kilometre radius of a city they should be means test free for receiving Austudy. This places tremendous strain on the families, and I think something needs to be done for the families. I know that Austudy has been improved, but I think a review should be taken of Austudy to see what can be done to help ordinary Australians, particularly those living in country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is the area of unemployment. In Australia rural unemployment is higher and more prolonged than urban unemployment. This places tremendous strain on local councils, so it was very heartening news for local government in my area to receive the financial boost under the local capital works program announced in the Budget. The total amount allocated to councils in my area is $3,127,339. I am particularly delighted about this. Apart from the fact that it will create a number of worthwhile projects and constructively employ people for a period of time, the Mayor of Port Pirie, Dennis Crisp, who is the Mayor of a very progressive council in my area, came forward to the Government with this type of proposal and these recommendations. I am pleased that the Government acted upon these proposals, because I think that country people suffer more than those in the city areas. As I said earlier, unemployment is prolonged in country areas and getting employment is very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exacerbates the problem of people from country areas moving to cities, and we will have the huge problem of small towns and regional areas becoming ghost towns. It is very sad indeed, when we have the infrastructure there, that good hospitals, good schools, and other infrastructure will be left idle simply because people who cannot get work have moved into the cities, creating a problem of overpopulation. I hope something can be done about that, and I am continually raising that issue with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other promising things that came up prior to the Budget was the fact that $12m was allocated for the refurbishment of the Indian Pacific train. This work takes place at Port Augusta&mdash;John McElligot, who runs the refurbishment program, does an excellent job&mdash;and much superb work is done on the refurbishment of trains. The Indian Pacific is one of the great train lines of the world. It is perhaps sad that we do not sell this as a tourism project as much as we should, because people who have had the opportunity to travel from Sydney to Perth on that train have all said that it is a wonderful opportunity. I hope that, under the new National Freight Corporation in conjunction with Australian National, we go out and sell that project because it is very worth while. It would be a tremendous fillip if we could sell that project. Most people would be aware that for every 26 tourists that come to Australia one full time job is created. I guess most members have had the opportunity to travel overseas, and some of the tourist projects that are sold do not come within a bull's roar of some of the projects that we could sell here and, unfortunately, do not sell strongly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said during this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) about the changes in unemployment, but I do not think we give enough praise and credence to some of the trade unions, particularly in my area, who have made some dramatic changes. I pay tribute to Doug Elkins of the Trades and Labour Council and some of the trade union leaders within Whyalla, for instance, where dramatic change has taken place. Communications between employers and employees have improved. For instance, in Whyalla some 6,400 workers were employed in BHP about 10 years ago in the steel making and shipbuilding division. There is no doubt that the steel industry was going to go under. It was very uncompetitive. As a result of cooperation between the work force and the management of the company, Australia is now a world leader in steel manufacturing. Hard-headed steel rails are transported all over the world. That situation was achieved at some cost to the labour force because less than 3,000 people now work in the steel industry there. But there has been no industrial disputation; the shedding of labour has been done through the trade union movement in conjunction with BHP. It has been done in a very productive way. Natural attrition has taken place. Everybody has acted in the best interests of the town and the company. That has been very worth while indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I talked to John Prescott of BHP he admitted that, out of all the steel centres in Australia, Whyalla can hold its head high because of the way its people have cooperated. The same sort of thing has happened at the BHAS in Port Pirie, which is the largest lead smelting works in the world. For some time, the price of lead was extremely low. Changes had to be made within the industry and consequently, with cooperation between the work force and management, these changes took place. Although it is sad to see many people losing their jobs, if they had not made these changes both the lead smelting works at Port Pirie and the steel industry at Whyalla would have gone under. So they understand what change is all about. The workers really have taken the lead in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the trade unions have been very productive and helpful. Doug Elkins, the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Whyalla, has been at the forefront. It has not been easy to sell the changes to their constituency, but they have taken on the hard job. We have reaped the benefits because of the changes that have taken place. We have also been very fortunate to have had the cooperation of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise another matter in this House. In doing so, I note that it is good to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) at the table. One could say that he is one of the more progressive Parliamentary Secretaries. I hope that he will take on board the situation facing many people who retired some time ago and have lived on their superannuation, at no cost to the Government. Now that interest rates have fallen, they have been forced to withdraw some of that superannuation. That is quite sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the Government needs to look at&mdash;and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take it on board&mdash;is the lifting of the tax threshold to a responsible level, something like $10,000. There is no doubt about it&mdash;if we are going to be an economically viable country in the future, we need a national superannuation scheme. We need to give people every incentive possible to join a superannuation scheme. Those people who, in the past, have provided for their future, those who made big sacrifices and who are now being burdened by the fact that they are probably less well off than people on ordinary pensions, need to be compensated. With a national superannuation scheme, which I fully support, we would have a pool of our own resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is any secret that we are the most foreign-owned country in the world, and that is a sad indictment on the Australian people and Australia in general. If some overseas country wants to withdraw its funds or some investor wants to withdraw his or her funds, what is going to happen? Interest rates will go up to attract the funding back within the country. If we could have a national superannuation scheme, with billions of dollars to call on for any major project such as another Snowy Mountains scheme, we would have our own resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I have spoken on a number of wide-ranging issues. It is imperative that the Government and the Minister's representative, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, who is at the table, take on board some of those matters, particularly the one concerning the superannuation scheme and the lifting of the tax threshold. Another issue I ask them to look at is that of private health coverage. It is not just wealthy people in Australia who take out private health insurance. In my area in particular the overwhelming majority of people who do so are ordinary people and our voters. So it is important that we look at that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week we have been treated to the spectacle of Labor's aristocrats of power, both superannuated and current, fighting for prime position on the pedestal of Labor history. Labor's former failed leader, Gough Whitlam, delivered what in newspaper cliches is called `a stinging attack' on his more recently superannuated brother in leadership, Bob Hawke. Gough said, a trifle bitterly, that Bob had `one objective in public life and that was to become Prime Minister. And when he got there he had no purpose . . . he never had any policies except the accord'. To add insult to injury, Whitlam then went on to anoint the present incumbent of office, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), his so-called `spiritual successor'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there is no show without Punch, and Keating and Hawke were the inseparable Punch and Judy of the last decade. There might have been some bitterness in that marriage and the usual amount of domestic violence, as Punch was prone to beat up Judy whenever the opportunity offered, but a marriage it was: Hawke and Keating; Keating and Hawke. Like the masked crusaders from Gotham City, Batman and Robin, they were a pair. And as Hawke pointed out in his fortnightly column in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently, his mate, the honourable member for Blaxland, was wont to be irrelevant about the hallowed Whitlam leadership of yore. The honourable member for Blaxland wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 13 November 1987 of the Whitlam Government's fatal flaw, which was `a mismatch of ends and means'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member commented that Whitlam's view that the Labor Party since 1983 had been `seized by some new and alien philosophy', was `a view which equates honour with failure and success with sell-out. It's the view of those who suffer from a sort of romantic nostalgia about a period which after all produced pretty indifferent outcomes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we now to assume that, like his namesake St Paul, who we might recall prayed to God, `Make me good, but not yet', the honourable member for Blaxland also had a knock on the head which caused him recently to see celestial stars where none had been before? The name of the game&mdash;and I use the word `game' advisedly, because the honourable member for Blaxland is always talking about games&mdash;and a good measure of someone's unreality index is votes at any cost, as long as it is at someone else's cost. Politics for the honourable member for Blaxland is just a game of brinkmanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other moral we can draw from the Punch and Judy divorce and Punch's deification in Labor heaven is that words mean as little as one wants them to mean. To this end, a good memory is a sore handicap. After recently decrying the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as shrill, strident and abusive&mdash;terms which suggested that he spends some time on self-reflection&mdash;the honourable member for Blaxland then indulged in some romantic glossing of Labor's noble achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He told us that Labor had developed an efficient market economy `with a nice social policy wrapped around it'. Leaving aside the fact that we have the most severe recession since the Great Depression with half of our young people unemployed, a permanent army of long term unemployed, an underlying deficit of more than $20 billion in the last Budget, and not the $13 billion as stated, and a blow-out in imports to $5 billion in July, the highest monthly figure on record, which assembled facts might lead a rational man to believe that our current economy was not so efficient&mdash;leaving aside these mere trifles about the economy&mdash;let us look at this nice, social policy wrapped around the fish and chips of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Blaxland waxed lyrical about `all the social balances'. He said there would be access to education and health, support for women, women's policies, aged care, child-care and occupational superannuation. Mr Keating was quoting the Leader of the Opposition as saying, `Let's turn back a century of social and industrial advances. Let's have a policy of social impoverishment and the economic phoenixes, and the self-made people will rise from the ashes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, as to the century of advances, these were not Labor's doing, because until this latest Punch and Judy show, which has brought us economic disaster and the brief Whitlam fiasco, Labor had only 16 years and six months in power in this century. Robert Gordon Menzies said in 1958 that the Liberal Party did not seek to win elections by making lush promises about social services. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have, let me remind you, always performed much more than we have promised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the Liberal Party has always seen itself as having a mandate for social compassion and social reform. Alfred Deakin, our spiritual forebear, explained liberalism as a belief in `equality of political rights without reference to creed, and equality of legal rights without consideration of wealth or quality'. Votes for women and the principle of one man one vote were the very plinth of this platform. Liberalism taught that all, including the poorest in the community, should have their due and that there should be a minimum rate of wages and wise factory legislation to prevent wealth from taking advantage of the needy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early stages of the Second World War, the Menzies Government announced that social security was to be one major objective in the post-war period. In 1941, it began a series of new social security programs with a scheme of child endowment. The previous Labor Government had boasted that it would create a national health scheme but had done little more than quarrel with the very people&mdash;the doctors&mdash;whose cooperation was vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took Australia's first Liberal Government to create a national health scheme in 1949. It was not at that stage a comprehensive scheme, being, as we recall, only for invalid, old age, widows and service pensioners. But it was a Liberal government which started it, and at the time it was said to have no superior in the world. The same government doubled the unemployment benefit and raised pensions, which had not gone up under the previous Chifley Government despite rapidly rising prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberal governments oversaw the enormous post-war immigrant influx. During the years of Liberal governments when the Labor Party was under the leadership of Arthur Calwell, there was virtually no difference between the Labor and Liberal social policy. I want to mention only a couple of recent social welfare policy signposts on the Liberal side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it should not be forgotten that the Fraser Government introduced the system of family allowances. Also important was the replacement of the pensions means test by an income test and the provision for automatic changes in the rates of pensions and benefits in line with changes in the consumer price index. The same Government&mdash;the Fraser Government&mdash;also set up a consultative committee on women's welfare, which Labor has continued except in a more straitened form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that a Labor government in Victoria insisted that single men during the Great Depression march on foot from town to town throughout the entire State&mdash;travelling for work was the euphemism used&mdash;in order to pick up their dole pittance, then called `sustenance' like something out of some Dickensian poorhouse. The fact is that it was terrified of insurrection by the workers. It was a cruel abuse of human lives in those years. Let us not forget, too, that Labor espoused the White Australia policy, which now presents a grubby blot on its multicultural conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what passes for achievement in the Government's current rhetoric is a mirage in the desert. Access to health that the honourable member for Blaxland speaks of is a joke. People in the lowest socioeconomic sector are taking out expensive private insurance that they can ill-afford to guarantee them hospital treatment because the public hospitals are now so overburdened that they can only treat what is supposed to be non-elective surgery. These are facts that the honourable member for Grey, a member of this Government, pointed out in the speech before mine tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to one hospital administrator, old age pensioners are coming to private hospitals with their life savings to buy themselves the treatment they need urgently for painful conditions which are deemed elective, such as hip replacements. People are dying while they wait for treatment in public hospital queues in this country. Is this access to health? Access for whom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding access to education, Labor policies have demonstrably not led to any increase in the number of working class students at tertiary institutions. Rather, it is the reverse. It is true that there are many more women now in the work force but, as middle management males have lost their jobs in the last few years, women have filled the least well-paid dogsbody jobs in the work force. I suppose that this is what the honourable member for Blaxland would call dead-end jobs rather than the interesting jobs that he was promising the young people all over this country. For all the trumpeting, formal child-care remains prohibitively expensive and constitutes less than 10 per cent of child-care used by working mothers, many of whom are only working because of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has created a less equal society, despite all its rhetoric to the contrary. In fact, it is one of the great obscenities of our time that this Government can parade itself in all the garb of compassion when every objective assessment of its policies leads inevitably to the other conclusion. According to the latest statistics released in this year's Federal Budget Papers, more than 300 people with taxable incomes of over $1m paid an average tax rate of 26.1c in the dollar. These figures reflect tax changes for higher income earners made by the Hawke-Keating Government. Top earners did not do nearly so well under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the figures for Mr Fraser's last year in office, 1982-83, show that people earning more than $100,000 paid an average of 53.2c in the dollar in tax compared with 34.6c in the dollar in 1990-91. This difference was engineered by Labor's drop in the top marginal tax rate and the introduction of the dividend imputation scheme. On any close examination, the honourable member for Blaxland's social policy looks to be no more than a grubby and rather greasy bit of butcher's paper best consigned to the nearest rubbish bin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's profligacy in promising what it cannot deliver continued in its One Nation statement in February and in the Budget statements. The general idea seemed to be to steal the coalition's thunder with an `all gain, no pain' handout of tax cuts. The only problem is that they cannot be delivered because there is no money left in the piggy bank.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was picked up by none other than ex-Prime Minister Hawke who obligingly pointed out that the Budget's signalling of probable business tax increases in 1995 had left a `big question mark hanging over the Government vis-a-vis the business community'. It is now a contest, as Mr Hawke realised, of one set of taxes versus another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Spend now, and save later&mdash;a lot later&mdash;has been the hallmark of the Keating approach to the Australian economy, which is nowhere better enunciated than in this last lacklustre Budget. Remember all the jobs that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted of creating in the 1980s? He was at it again in Question Time today when he spoke about 1.8 million jobs. These jobs have now gone and what have we got?  We have a net foreign debt of $148,000m. This year's Budget was no different&mdash;spend now and pay later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two aspects of the Budget are cause for particular concern. The first is the size of the deficit which is claimed to be $13.4 billion. That itself is a huge blow-out from the $4.7 billion in last year's Budget and even a blow-out against the revised figures of the One Nation statement in February. We have a situation where another $1,000 worth of foreign debt will be owed by every man, woman and child in this country adding to more than $8,000 worth of foreign debt attributable to every man, woman and child in Australia. When this Government came to power in 1982-83, the equivalent amount of foreign debt for every man, woman and child in this country was just $1,500. Spend now and pay later. Spend now all right, and we will all pay later&mdash;every man, woman and child in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that the Government `will consider and implement a number of tax changes' to reduce the 1995 Budget deficit. The fine print claims that the Government will examine withholding tax, prescribed payments tax and fringe benefits tax to raise up to $3 billion&mdash;$3,000m more. So tax cuts can only be had now if it means tax increases in the future; `in the future' being 1995 which is, of course, after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the goods and services tax, which is basically a discretionary tax which someone chooses to pay or not pay according to whether they decide to buy or to save, Labor's taxes are all taxes at source. Let us take the withholding tax, for example. A 20 per cent withholding tax on interest earned in bank accounts is an insidious and stupid measure. It is a harsh penalty for struggling retirees in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For business, it fails to recognise that all interest is not profit. These days many businesses, although operating cash positively, rely on interest earnings to offset operating losses and now businesses will be taxed at monthly intervals of 20 per cent by the Government. The banks will hardly do all this deducting for free, which will only add to the costs of industry which are so high compared with our competitor nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, account holders will earn less because they will lose the compounding benefit of 20 per cent monthly interest and so will be able to save less than they can save at present; and domestic savings will be lower than the already lowest level in the history of this Commonwealth. Is this an incentive to industry or to the nation to save the capital we need to invest in our future? Hardly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite pump priming of $3,000m, as proposed in this Budget, it is expected that unemployment will remain at over 10 per cent well into 1993. It is steady as we go into the quicksand. Labor's policies have failed the Australian people. This Government has become no more than a blight on the hill. The Treasurer told us no less than seven times in his Budget Speech that the Keating Government was a caring government. It has yet to demonstrate that it has ever cared, and it does not care for anything more now than staying in power. </PARA>

The employment advertisement series has levelled out and the GDP has lifted each quarter since mid-1991 and, with it, retail sales, motor vehicle registrations and dwelling approvals. Indeed, there are also clear upward trends in the manufacturing production series and in new capital expenditure. I note that bankruptcy rates have been falling since September 1991. I suppose the most remarkable graph is that lending for housing is now standing at all time record levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things are positive, but many in the community quite rightly feel that this is not being reflected in their day to day lives, and they wonder why. I suppose the principal reason is that the last thing to move in economic recovery is usually unemployment. Although there has been a movement downwards in the unemployment rate recently and although the number of people in jobs has gone up, this has been very patchy and it is difficult to say that there is an emphatic downward trajectory taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is made worse in the State that I represent, South Australia, by the fact that the State by State figures are uneven. Although the last two monthly figures have shown an improvement in employment and a reduction in unemployment, that is not necessarily going to be the case tomorrow. I would expect a rather flattish unemployment result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unemployment situation is further worried by the fact that the major industrial countries share with us a recessionary situation. Some of them are even looking worse than we are in terms of a recovery. Indeed, as far as economic growth is concerned, we are at the top end of the table, although our unemployment improvement is no greater than most of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that general picture that the Federal Government has brought down this Budget. The result is that the Government has decided, unashamedly and unabashedly, as opposed to the situation that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), was trying to describe, to stimulate the economy by putting an injection of public funds into economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resulting deficit that comes out of that decision is about $13 billion, or about 3 1/3per cent of GDP. This is a turnaround, it is quite true, from previous Budgets, where there has either been a small Budget deficit projected, as in the case of last year, or even four Budget surpluses, which is what we as a government ran in the late 1980s. I should point out that this is not a large Budget deficit by international standards and it is still much smaller than the coalition's farewell Budget of 1982-83. That was nearer to 4 per cent than 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's Budget deficit, in other words, follows a small deficit and four consecutive Labor Budget surpluses which are able to take the level of Commonwealth debt to an acceptably low level by retiring government bonds and thereby enabling some expansion of debt to be quite acceptable to the markets and to economic activity over the next year in order to exercise the stabilising effect of what are usually called in economic textbooks built-in stabilisers. So the Government is unashamedly stimulating the economy as best it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which this stimulation is occurring is chiefly through a fall in revenue or, to be more precise, a fall in the growth rate of revenue as opposed to an increase in the rate of expenditure. Revenue will climb by 0.5 per cent in real terms as against an increase in outlays by 4.1 per cent in real terms, which means that there will be a 3.3 per cent GDP deficit, which is stimulatory, most of it occurring by a lack of growth of revenue or taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also in the economy some expansion of expenditure in the form of this 4.1 per cent increase in real terms, a quite moderate expansion that has proven to be, by and large, acceptable to international money markets; yet that will have a stimulatory effect. What do these stimulatory programs look like? The first and most notable is to direct job creation measures at the local level. The principal effort made here is the allocation of $345m targeted directly to those local government authorities whose areas have been identified as those with the highest rates of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government authorities will be eligible for such funds if they can show that they have projects which can employ people and which can be undertaken in the very short term and that those projects are worthwhile additions to community facilities: projects of a recreational, sporting or community service kind or projects to do with tourism where we think the infrastructure in many of our cities and indeed regional areas is lacking. In other words, the Government is bypassing the States, which have proven to be rather slow spenders of government funds in the past, and is going straight to local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Wednesday, in pursuit of these rapid infusions of well spent moneys into our local authorities, I chaired a meeting at my office in the central business district of Adelaide of local government administrators and elected councillors whose areas were eligible to receive funds and who were trying to design projects appropriate for their applications. The Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) attended. We had an extensive discussion about where they would apply to spend the money. I thought many of the projects they suggested were quite innovative, some relating to tourists, others relating to child-care centres, bike path infrastructure, the renovation of historical buildings, streetscape projects, parklands for recreational purposes and many other such projects&mdash;useful projects that should be undertaken anyway. These funds are then able to be brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not hear too much of the criticism that we heard in this House that these funds were wasteful at the grassroots level. In fact, all these councils, which would represent diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and political affiliations, were very appreciative of these opportunities to upgrade facilities in their areas. The only critics I could find in South Australia were those councils who were not eligible to receive funding, who were rather quickly mollified in most instances when they realised that they could readily be eligible for such funding if they whacked up their unemployment rates, which they thought were unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lord Mayor of Adelaide, who was critical of the program and who is, of course, an endorsed Liberal candidate at the forthcoming State election, thought that the money was not well served but then would not hand it over to a few other councils which said that they had some very good projects to spend it on. One State Liberal shadow Minister thought too much was to be spent in Labor held seats. Unfortunately, while this was a fine idea, it was an unsustainable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also allocates funds for our national infrastructure more directly, to areas such as rail expenditure, which will go through the National Rail Authority. I am pleased to say that in my own area there are a number of very specific expenditures, which I should itemise, and which I think will be very useful in the long term. Islington rail workshops, in the seat of Adelaide, will receive about $4m, enabling them much better to service the national rail infrastructure and rolling stock. Port Augusta, a much larger rail yard, will also receive sums of money. But most interesting has been the $12m refurbishment plan for the Indian Pacific Railway, which I would like to say a couple of things about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited the Indian Pacific demonstration at Keswick rail yards a few months ago, where they showed me what they had in mind for the Indian Pacific. Their proposition is that as we standardise the rail gauge from Cairns around the coast to Perth, with a spur line that is used by the Ghan to Alice Springs, if we can modernise, redesign and upgrade the Indian Pacific rolling stock, which comprises about five trains, we would be in a position to advertise as one of the great international drawcards for rail travel the Cairns-Perth round-the-coast rail routes in differently designed motifs. One would be colonial Australia, others would be Aboriginal Australia, bush Australia and multicultural Australia. One could fly into Cairns as an international tourist, get on and then roll around the coast to wherever was your chosen destination from which to fly out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very imaginative, tourist oriented project. I think over the next decade, if this is marketed properly, it could be seen as a rival to the Trans-Siberian which I have travelled on. I have to say that under socialism it lacked some of the amenities that the modern international traveller would have appreciated. It did, however, have 92 stops, at each of which the greatest culinary delicacy I could come across was roast potato, which no doubt did wonders for my waistline and induced frostbite when I left the train to buy it. It could also rival the Orient Express, which I have seen only in the great Hercule Poirot movies&mdash;indeed, it seemed most amusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think around-the-coast rail stock for Australia, with a little route up the Ghan into Alice Springs&mdash;which is now operating profitably&mdash;is a really imaginative way to spend $12m. It will be tremendously well spent. If any members of the Opposition are visiting Adelaide in the next couple of weeks&mdash;indeed in the next few years&mdash;I can arrange for them to have a look at this proposal. I hope it will receive bipartisan support because it is a very imaginative effort for which our rail yards should be commended. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road improvements are also to be brought on stream. Most of these do not attract the romantic nostalgia of the long rail routes. Most of these are to be intercity trunk routes, but I draw the attention of honourable members to one of them since it is in my seat. We are going to spend $14m upgrading the Main South Road, which is a severe bottleneck in the carriage of persons and product between the northern and southern areas of metropolitan Adelaide. The latest bottleneck&mdash;much of the rest of it having been improved&mdash;is between the River Torrens and Anzac Highway which marks the boundary between my seat and that of Hindmarsh. That is going to be upgraded at a cost of $14m and the money could not be better spent. It is a fine micro-economic reform effort and I am sure much labour will be employed in that area to very good effect in improving our national infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, this project is adjacent to another national infrastructure project which has been brought forward, again in my seat, to which I would like to draw the Deputy Speaker's attention. That is the expenditure of about $4m of building better cities program money in the Mile End area. Despite the moneys which are being spent on the upgrading of the national railway infrastructure, there is now a redundant railway yard at Mile End which is adjacent to a number of other rather run down manufacturing establishments which are unlikely to receive attention directly from private sector industrial capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building better cities program has designated that as a redevelopment area, which will provide for inner city residential development with parklands, community facilities and probably a wetlands area in the western parklands. It is anticipated that about 5,000 new residents will move in there&mdash;an inner city area with affordable housing&mdash;over the next couple of years. I attended the launch of this program in Adelaide last month with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also places considerable emphasis on the expansion of the education system. As one who spent two decades in the tertiary education system in Australia, I am always pleased to see this expanded. It is a sector which we have increased by over 50 per cent during our term of office, achieving the equivalent of constructing 12 medium-size university campuses and in many parts of this country opening up university education to sections of the population&mdash;particularly working-class people, but also people in country areas who were singularly disadvantaged for 100 years of the previous tertiary education system. We are now injecting more money into capital expenditure in universities. I am pleased to say that two in my seat will be receiving about $14m for the upgrading of buildings, one of which I spent two decades in&mdash;and I can assure honourable members that even without my efforts it would have required refurbishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an increase in the number of postgraduate research awards; there are new opportunities for people to study at the university through open learning; and a number of other innovatory efforts are being made in the secondary and tertiary education system. Of course, there has been a huge improvement in the quality and quantity of traineeships, programs and places for acquiring skills in a post-secondary education job market, and Skillshare programs in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who has spent the last four years of his life as one of the directors on the Skillshare program, I can attest to the efficiency of these programs. I am delighted to see that over the last couple of years the Opposition has dropped its policy platform of seeking to abolish Skillshare and will go ahead with the innovative program which has proven a great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Skillshare project I am involved with has regularly placed over 50 per cent of the people that come in the front door into its programs. Given that it targets long term unemployed people who have found particular difficulty in gaining employment, I think this is a very worthwhile program. If we can move to a bipartisan position on that issue, I will be more than pleased. In general, announced before the Budget, the national employment and training plan for young Australians, which followed on the youth job summit, allocated $770m for funding in this Budget to provide employment and training opportunities for nearly 100,000 young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health budget introduces about $1.6 billion of new spending into our health system. The money is chiefly allocated to capital investment, infrastructure and other expenditure programs to improve access to public hospitals and to reduce waiting lists. There is some controversy over the allocation of tax deductibility to private health insurance funds and there is also some controversy over whether money should be allocated to private hospitals. While I do not entirely go along with the remarks of my colleague and friend the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), I do think that, if it were the case that our public hospitals were suffering exorbitant waiting lists that were producing the deaths that have previously been suggested occurred as a result of people not being able to get immediate access to hospitals and if there were large numbers of vacant beds occurring at the same time in the private hospital system, something might be done to match these vacancies with the demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anxious to find out whether this was the case, I had a meeting on Monday with representatives of all the private hospitals in my seat and a few that are not in my seat to discuss this matter. At the moment, the private hospitals in the Adelaide metropolitan area are, generally speaking, experiencing a pretty healthy occupancy rate, although they do have apprehensions about the decline in subscriptions to the private health insurance system. If the decline were to be exorbitant to the extent that their financial lives were at stake, it would attract my immediate attention. At this stage, I do not think the existence of the private hospital system is at stake, but it is something I will keep an open mind about and my eye very closely on, as I told them at this meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some expenditure increases in the domiciliary nursing care benefit and extended eligibility for carers' pension, and I welcome this. The Budget will also see pensions increase by $6 per fortnight from 23 January 1993 and an extension of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned a few of the increases in expenditure that have been itemised in this Budget. I welcome them as useful expenditure patterns to add to the structure of national transportation, of national residential facilities, of national educational facilities, of our health system and some of the domiciliary services we offer for people who need to be cared for at home. All of these things are very useful in an environment where, economically, it was responsible and indeed necessary that the Government provide some additional stimulus to the national economy. If one can identify programs that one would like to see undertaken, but for reasons of financial stringency in an environment such as the late 1980s when it was necessary to reign in public expenditure because of the very rapid growth rate of the private expenditure, then now is the time to take on board some of these improvements to our national infrastructure. I welcome the direction in which they have been shifted; that is, the community works program at the local level, the infrastructure of transportation, the infrastructure of education and the infrastructure of health. All of these are welcome additions to our programs and things which I indeed welcome. With that, I close my remarks on this Budget. </PARA>

But this, in common with the Budget that we are discussing tonight, was nothing more than an exercise in subterfuge. The focus has been on dishonesty, deceit and division, instead of cohesion, cooperation and commitment. The hope seems to have been that if we can hide from the people the true nature of our national problems and what needs to be done to address them, we might yet sustain ourselves on the hope that they will vote for us, despite the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this mislaid and wayward philosophy is policies which will simply see a continuation of the bankruptcies in our small business sector and our business community in general, and a continuation of the unemployment problems that have blighted this nation for so long. If we want to restore business we must restore an economic environment which encourages confidence, the sort of confidence that is a prerequisite for investment&mdash;investment in genuinely productive exercises, not the sort of speculative bubbles that we saw so much of in the 1980s.

The abolition of the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and the payroll tax, in particular, will have a major impact on farmers. Farmers sometimes say to me that they do not pay payroll tax so they cannot see how they will be helped by that initiative.

Add to that the relief in the order of $1.5 billion for the food processing industry&mdash;Australia's biggest industry. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) never stops talking about the need for value adding rural product in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if that sort of relief in terms of direct contribution to the farm sector or the reduction of costs is lacking in the Budget. The Budget forecasts a very substantial deficit&mdash;a deficit that is reflective of the most massive turnaround in budgetary outcomes in this country that we have seen for many decades.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the Government's forecasting record&mdash;whether the result of fair or less than realistic calculations&mdash;is utterly appalling. That raises the very real danger that the projected deficit, already unacceptably high at $13.4 billion, will blow out. I hope it does not blow out as badly as last year's which more than doubled from the original prediction. The danger is that the nation's bankers, those overseas to whom we owe so much and who, in so many ways now, call the tune for us, will withdraw their money and the markets will respond by pushing up interest rates again. We have seen evidence of that in the last couple of weeks.

He suggested that we commonly think of America, Britain, Japan and Germany. We do like to think of ourselves as enjoying living standards up there with those sorts of wealthy and productive nations. I suspect that many Australians still think of ourselves as belonging in that category of nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, over the last 20 years the reality is that we have slipped from the top third of OECD nations in terms of take-home pay levels, disposable household income, to the bottom third. That is not a bad record over a couple of generations. In fairness, it is not just this Government's fault. But the reality is that this Government has done more to exacerbate the problem than anyone else, it has done nothing to arrest the problem and it seems to be determined to continually avoid confronting that problem. If that has been our performance over the last couple of decades, one can only speculate as to where we might end up in the next generation if we do not get serious about taking on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know only too well, our industrial relations system in this country has been based on the monopoly representation of employees by unions, compulsory arbitration, and the setting of awards and conditions through the highly centralised process of national wage case hearings conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission. It is inflexible, bureaucratic, anachronistic and confrontationist. It is based on the old class warfare ideas that dominated industrial relations last century. Ironically, it is the very model, if you like, from the British system that we ought to reject. When there is so much in our own culture and heritage which we ought to be proud of and keen to maintain, the Government wants to reject those things and maintain this system which we think is the very thing that ought be disposed of. Despite the rhetoric and the talk of reform, the reality is that the system remains pretty much open to the charge of being inflexible and bureaucratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that a very real change in the way things are done in this country is necessary. We have clearly, openly and honestly outlined our industrial relations proposals. The policy is built on four major principles. The first is the absolute right of individual employers and their employees to make voluntary agreements at a workplace level, without the intervention of organisations or industrial tribunals and subject only to the observance of a decent minimum wage structure&mdash;not a slave labour rate&mdash;and other minima relating to things like sickness benefits, leave and existing statutory requirements relating to health and safety matters. Beyond that, people ought to have the right to freely negotiate their own workplace arrangements. After all, the people in the workplace are those who are most likely to have a clear idea of how to make their workplace work to the best advantage of all involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle is that we ought to establish once and for all the absolute right of individuals to join or not to join a trade union. It is time that we stopped kidding ourselves that there is no such thing as de facto compulsory trade unionism in this country. The concept is inimical to freedom and runs strongly counter to the idea of effective choice in the matter of working out our own workplace arrangements. The reality is that we do, of course, have closed shops in Australia. The Pilbara is evidence of that. There we lost $50m or $60m worth of export income simply over a dispute because somebody wanted to exercise his right not to belong to a trade union. One ought to have the right to belong or the absolute right not to belong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is the maintenance of that concept, that binding idea, that the conduct of all Australians should be subject to the ordinary laws of Australia, administered wherever possible by the ordinary courts of Australia; and the fourth principle is the right of trade unionists to associate on an enterprise, industry or craft basis without arbitrary restrictions of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is overwhelming evidence that Australia's economic performance is declining. That has been exacerbated by the existing industrial relations system. Nevertheless, the Government, as evidenced in this Budget, has paid only lip service to the manifest need to properly decentralise our industrial relations system through the use of enterprise agreements. This must end. It is a paradox, to put it kindly, that the accord partners should be preaching salvation by enterprise bargaining but at the same time damning enterprise unions by insisting on a 10,000 minimum membership threshold. By contrast, the system of enterprise agreements proposed by the coalition would not be within the Commission's purview. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I make the point at the outset that this Budget's prime focus is on jobs, economic growth and economic recovery for Australia. Fundamentally, it reinforces the Labor Government's commitment to caring, compassion and concern for those in need. It is a reinforcement of the Government's social justice commitments, which have been the hallmark of its period of office since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day after the Budget, the headline on the front page of the local paper that circulates in my electorate, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parramatta Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, was `Jobs, Jobs, Jobs&mdash;Thanks Keating'. I suggest that is a very accurate reflection of the 1992 Budget. It fundamentally sums up the ingredients in the Budget for this year. It recognises the importance that this Budget has in setting the framework to create the recovery and the jobs that are essential for Australians. It recognises that economies such as ours are struggling worldwide because of a whole series of circumstances. The way to generate activity to get over those problems is to have government take initiative, demonstrate a lead, show the sort of stimulus that is required and demonstrate the capacity to deliver on those commitments. That is what this Budget does fundamentally. It focuses on those key things that will get recovery going. It recognises the pain and the hardship that many people have suffered during the recession. But it notes that the recovery ingredients are there, as is the capacity to build on them over the next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in the Budget provided for the responsible deficit figure of $13.4 billion. Again, I point out that that is 3.3 per cent of GDP. It is certainly a realistic and reasonable figure in the circumstances. It is also worth recognising that the ratio of outlays is still less than the figures of the seventies and the eighties. Therefore, I think it can be said in any sense that it was a reasonable and responsible fiscal stimulus, but one which at the same time has targets and defined goals and will achieve objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should contrast the approach adopted in the Budget that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down with that of the Opposition in these issues. As was clear from what the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said, when Opposition members talk about the needs of rural areas they fundamentally do not understand that the government services in those areas are part of the infrastructure that they require. In areas such as the electorate of Gwydir and Parramatta, they are a fundamental part of the infrastructure that is needed, be it in health care, aged care, child-care, road transportation or other forms of transportation&mdash;all of the things that government has a part in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take Fightback at its word, the Opposition is suggesting that it would cut something like $7 billion out of public outlays. Who are the ones that lose out of that $7 billion cut? Of course, they are the people that are in those categories&mdash;the ones that need aged care, child-care, education services and so on. It is clear from the speeches made by Opposition members in these debates on the Appropriation Bills that they have little recognition of areas that have high unemployment and require structural adjustment considerations. They have little understanding of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of things adopted in the Budget relating to the local capital works program are responsible in every sense of the word. One of the things that I have learnt over the years, after spending a long time in local government, is that local government is most capable of providing innovation and delivering immediate activity, without some of the bureaucratic delay that can occur with some of the projects at the State level. Local government can get things done. It has important projects that are able to be developed. It has projects in areas such as local tourism&mdash;things that can add value as time goes on, providing additional services that can create downstream employment in those types of industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the councils in the broader region of western Sydney, which represents about 1.6 million people, received about $43m under the local capital works program, and that is important. That is being done in a targeted way. Some councils did not get funding because it is worked out in relation to how much unemployment there has been in those areas over the last 12 months. The net effect of that $43m worth of expenditure will be to create many job opportunities, and many new facilities will be developed which will build further opportunities into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Parramatta electorate two councils are directly affected and receive funding under the local capital works program. The Parramatta Council receives $4.14m and the Holroyd Council receives $2.94m. Both those councils have readily taken up this funding. They have recognised the value of it and have already started to develop and submit projects that will achieve very real and very sustainable objectives for those local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that, irrespective of the political persuasions of those opposite at the local level and what they say in this chamber, once the focus gets back to their electorates they are saying that they want to cooperate in these projects and they want to make them happen, but when they come here they want to jeopardise these sorts of programs. This two-faced approach on these issues is what we get from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those projects that are being conducted in the local areas do a number of important things. One of the projects in my area will restore one of the oldest buildings that exist in this country&mdash;it is 200 years old next year; a project that we have not been able to secure funding for from any other level. We are not only doing something that is going to have real tourism potential as time goes on; we are restoring part of the unique heritage of Australia. I defy anyone from the Opposition to suggest that such projects are not worth while and not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to the value of projects that relate to drainage in urban areas such as Parramatta. Very cost-effective projects will be developed. They will have immediate stimulus in creating jobs in the local area, and that certainly will be very welcome. In the longer term, they will have the real impact of making people's homes free of flooding. That is something that everyone should regard as fundamental. I know the community in the electorate of Parramatta does. It is a pity that the Opposition would want to put at risk programs as valuable as that to communities such as those in the Parramatta electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to labour market initiatives and the range of flexible programs that have been developed to provide the skills for the range of initiatives in the Jobstart and the Jobtrain programs. They are designed to encourage people who have different experiences, either because of time out of work or the restructuring of industries, to get training opportunities and to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that approach of trying to provide structured re-adjustment and retraining where it is required with the approach of those opposite in these areas. They seem quite happy to decimate whole industries. For instance, the Opposition continually runs an argument that it is going to pursue zero tariffs no matter what, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has made clear in the last few hours. Those opposite are going to proceed on that basis and destroy industries. Opposition members keep saying things such as, `Don't you worry about that. The goods and services tax will fix up all those things. The zero tariffs will just happen. People will get cheaper cars and other things'. But jobs are irrelevant as far as the Opposition is concerned, it would appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs are relevant. The industries that have been through the restructuring process understand the relevance of the car plan and the steel plan. We have heard honourable members opposite talking about industrial relations. I would like to take some of those opposite out to a company like Dupont in my electorate to see the approach it takes to industrial relations and to see what nonsense is the talk about workers not being prepared to take up the challenge of restructuring their processes and of having reforms of work practices. Of course workers are prepared to do that, but they are not prepared to stand by idly while industries are destroyed because of the Opposition's approach to zero tariffs. The Opposition says that having a car industry for Australia is one of those optional extras. It does not really matter in its terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Budget makes it clear that we are concerned that we do have that structured growth and that we encourage growth to occur. Governments have a role to play in encouraging growth when we are in a period of economic difficulty. As we come into the recovery, it is doubly important that we use the resource base that has been built up to ensure that that recovery and those growth rates are ones that produce benefits to the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that within only a fortnight of the Government's Budget&mdash;which provided a real and sustainable stimulus in fiscal terms, but which most would still argue was within fairly modest projections&mdash;the Japanese, when faced with the difficulties of economic conditions in Japan, went for a stimulus to their economy which was three times greater in real terms or comparative terms to that conducted in Australia. They recognised that the way an economy faced with the difficulties that the Japanese economy is faced with, or with the difficulties that Australia is faced with, gets growth going once again is not to have a $7 billion cut in public expenditure which hits all those people with the greatest need: the way to do it is to ensure that governments take up some of the projects that can create those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They looked at infrastructure projects, local capital works projects and matters such as the ones we adopted in the One Nation statement in February relating to governments taking over with the taxation changes and so on. These are the very things that the One Nation statement, the jobs statement in July and the Budget that this Government has introduced are all designed to create&mdash;that is, the structured growth that is so essential and which will again create the opportunities which are so necessary for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is unrealistic to come in here and say, `We are going to change everything for the better by introducing a $27 billion tax. We are going to make things better. There are going to be more people employed because there is a $27 billion goods and services tax'. This tax is effectively a value added tax on labour as well as a tax on all the other services that, despite the Opposition's protestations, are not subject to taxation at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it will zero rate education, but we have already established that things like school excursions, food bought through school canteens and so on will be subject to the tax. There will be no exemptions for those things, because that is not part of the Opposition's agenda. It wants to go a step further than even Margaret Thatcher was prepared to go in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, one must ask: what purpose would there be in adopting this sort of approach? What rational reason would there be for adopting it? Why would we want to put an additional tax on someone's lunch at the school canteen and at the same time make Ferraris cheaper? One really does have to ask what sort of motivation is driving that sort of policy making. The Government recognises that with its labour market programs and initiatives in the education system it has a real commitment to schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday I was very pleased because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was able to open a new school in my electorate, Our Lady of Lebanon School at Harris Park, and was able to note there the great achievement there had been in school retention rates and particularly the number of young women completing secondary school. We have achieved a dramatic improvement in the number of women getting education and that was demonstrated very prominently at the school on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at what was provided in the Budget as far as education is concerned, one sees that there has been a massive increase in spending. In growth areas such as western Sydney, that is particularly important because we need additional education resources in areas of high population growth. The increase in recurrent funding for non-government schools for 1993 is $45m, on top of the One Nation funding, and again a similar sort of increase was provided for capital funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things are important and very relevant for the people of regions such as Parramatta, particularly those Catholic systemic schools which have certain demands. They are looking for additional resources. These have been provided in the Budget and that is very pleasing. In 1993 every student in secondary schools in areas such as Parramatta will benefit from recurrent funding at the rate of more than $2,100 per student and every primary school student will benefit from recurrent funding at the rate of more than $1,400 per student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government schools are not being neglected in that process either. An additional $60m will be allocated to government high schools. There will be important expenditure in areas like research, technology and library facilities, all of which will be valuable for students in high schools throughout areas such as the Parramatta electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that got very proper attention in this Budget is the needs of the aged and disabled in the community, where a compassionate approach was taken. The carer's pension represents a very important landmark in the recognition of those groups. The commitment of the Government to increase pensions in January by $6 per fortnight represents a real increase in line with our commitment to ensure that pensions are kept above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. These are important initiatives in difficult times, because people in that category really struggle when economic conditions are trying. The unemployed, especially the mature aged unemployed, got particular attention, which was also very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the aged and veterans, one thing that is really important is certainty about the future. An important initiative taken was to ensure that fringe benefits applied to all part rate pensioners and veterans. All age pensioners and veterans get the benefit of fringe benefits as a result of this Government's decision. That was an important decision, and I note in all the publicity that there has been no commitment by the Opposition to match it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet when one goes around and talks to pensioner groups, one finds repeatedly that that is the issue that many aged pensioners are concerned about. They say, `Can't we have the certainty of knowing that, irrespective of the movement of a dollar or two one way or the other in superannuation or other income, we will still get the fringe benefits?'. This Government has ensured that that occurs, and that is a very important change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of health care, the retention and strengthening of the Medicare system and additional funding for public hospitals are important issues for people in regions such as Parramatta. It is very important to note that we will not go down the track of the Americanisation of our health system. We are not prepared to countenance a situation where a large mass of the population gets denied health care in any form and is abandoned by the health system. We will not follow the approach of the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the approach of the Americans is essentially the approach of the Opposition. It is quite happy to have that sort of approach adopted for Australia. There is no way that this Government will countenance many people being left out of getting decent health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental structure that underpins the whole process is the need to get recovery and economic growth. We have created the ingredients for that to really flow through in the next 12 to 18 months. There are major problems here at the moment; there are major problems in many countries at the moment. When the United Kingdom is compared with the relevant data on Australia, Australia's problems pale into insignificance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have important considerations that we have to follow through. How will we do that? I suggest that the best way to do it is to have a more positive and assertive talk about Australia's future. We must recognise that at this stage we have the lowest inflation rate and the lowest interest rate regime in 20 years and a situation where our merchandised exports are at the highest growth level in history as far as exports in that category are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has always decried that fact each time interest rates were cut. Each time interest rates were cut, it said that we were pushing the pace too much. In February 1990, it said that it was political to be cutting interest rates. Ever since the cuts have occurred, it has said that there would be runs on the dollar or that something else would occur. Anything it can do to talk negatively about Australia, it will do, and it will go to almost any level to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget provides a positive, caring, compassionate, consistent, coherent strategy of growth for our economy, and it will create jobs. We still have a way to go because of the magnitude of the world recession we are dealing with, the drought and all the other factors involved, but the creative talents of Australians, coupled with the initiatives in this Budget, can create the environment to get real growth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said a little while ago, the most likely result is the prospect of some of the best educated and trained dole queues in the world. It is a Budget where an extra $3.4 billion will be pumped into the economy over the next two years to directly create just 27,000 new jobs and about 110,000 training places. In other words, the Government is spending more than $3 billion just to knock one percentage point off unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with this policy of throwing money at the problem, the Government, by its own admission, says that unemployment will not come down below 10 per cent and may hover closer to 11 per cent between now and the forthcoming Federal election, whenever that might be. On this issue, much of the $230m devoted to regional unemployment announced by the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) to go into the unemployment black spots will be spent in Labor held electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of this House, I repeat that in my electorate of Groom a big round zero is allocated in each of the three categories of that particular program. This generates little confidence in this Government&mdash;and my constituents are very disappointed&mdash;but, more importantly, it provides little hope for the nearly 7,000 people in receipt of Jobsearch payments in Toowoomba and the eastern Darling Downs region. This is an increase of more than 40 per cent in the last two years. That, of course, falls fairly and squarely at the feet of this irresponsible Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Government's failure to publish forward estimates of the deficit is designed to obscure a certain tax increase next year, of which the Medicare hike and the cigarette tax increase in this Budget are just the first instalments. In other words, this Budget offers the Australian people a clear choice between, on the one hand, a hidden tax agenda of a Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and, on the other hand, the all-cards-on-the-table funded economic reform Fightback package of a Hewson government. In a nutshell, this Budget offers Australia another year like the last 10 years&mdash;another year of self-delusion, failure, disappointment and squandered opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to the educational aspects in particular of this Budget. It reveals a government unable to break decisively with its flawed policies for education and training while stealing as much from our Fightback package as indeed it dares. Once again, quality has come off second best, as the Government tries to create the impression of a certain degree of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its policies for higher education continue the funding arrangements described by the Industry Commission as fatally flawed. Despite its vast spending spree in this Budget, the Government cannot provide the places needed for qualified students, and it refuses to give the institutions the freedom which will allow them to create places. I will return briefly to this point more specifically a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open learning program will provide opportunities for some who have been deprived to date. However, it will not address the unmet demand and there remain serious questions over its quality. I am sure that the remark made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech that `every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have access to a university education' will come back to haunt him. His disregard of the requirements for a quality university education is well known, but this appalling denigration of what a university education really means will disgust, and has disgusted, many in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to increase the discount on up-front payments of HECS is, once again, a direct steal from our Fightback package. The Austudy changes are an admission that the Opposition's criticisms of the inequities in, and the rorting of, the student financial assistance system have been fully justified. Austudy remains an inadequately targeted scheme and it will be fully reviewed by the coalition in government to ensure that it is fair to all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new optional loan scheme in this Budget, while adopting many features from the recommendations of the Chapman report, departs from those representations in certain key respects. In particular, the design of the scheme seems to do little to help rural students in genuine need who have been precluded from Austudy assistance by the assets test. Indeed, many of those students are within my electorate and the electorate of Maranoa, which is to the west of mine in southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schools decisions reflect the continuing collapse of the union-inspired new schools policy which is designed to prevent parents exercising educational choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-government schools funding decisions demonstrate once again the divisive nature of the Government's policy by continuing the freeze of per capita grants to schools in categories 1 to 4, even though it is obvious to all that present policies are threatening the viability of schools in those particular categories. There is no recognition by the Government that all parents should have a basic entitlement to a measure of public support, and no satisfactory basis for the funding of non-government schools. This factor was reiterated in my electorate at a meeting several weeks ago by 1,000 concerned parents and friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to change the focus of the good schools policy towards promoting quality teaching in schools is an admission that this policy was misconceived from the beginning. Presumably, the Government has now discovered that good schools require quality teaching. They require much more besides, but the Government is listening only to the agenda of the teaching unions, et cetera. This is confirmed by its support for the hijacking of the move towards teacher professionalism by the Australian Teachers Union through the proposal for a national teachers council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, issues of quality and genuine structural reform of Australian education and training as proposed by the coalition remain off the Government's agenda. Only a strategy aimed at raising the standards of Australian education and training to international levels will provide a sound base for employment opportunities and ultimately secure this country's long term future. It is this strategy that we on this side of the House provide in the Fightback package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">USQ's view is that the Government has changed the rules governing capital works mid-stream, effectively ending the university's plans for a new building and leaving it with nothing but a hollow promise and little opportunity to complete its modest development plans.</PARA>
<PARA>This evening Professor Leal and Mrs Dickson were to fly to Canberra for a meeting with Minister Baldwin tomorrow morning. As late as mid morning today, that meeting was cancelled. I hope it was only postponed, hopefully only until Monday. If and when both Professor Leal and Mrs Dickson do arrive in Canberra for discussions with the Minister, I feel sure that they will present a clear and convincing case and make five points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make those five points very briefly. The first point is that at a joint meeting of Commonwealth and State authorities in November 1991 an understanding was reached that USQ would receive $12m in 1994 and $8m in 1996 for a technologies building. This project had been identified by the State of Queensland as the top priority for that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the Commonwealth has recently changed the methods of allocating capital grants. This means that USQ will now receive only $1.37m in 1994, effectively eliminating any chance of constructing the technologies building. This has severe consequences for the future development of USQ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that, since 1990, USQ has been enrolling 250 students a year more than its funding warrants. This has been done to provide additional places for students in Toowoomba and south-eastern Queensland. The financial strain put on USQ by the loss of this promised capital funding will mean that this policy can no longer be supported. Educational opportunity in Queensland will be further restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is that a special Budget allocation of $31m was recently made available to fund building projects for universities as part of a job creation strategy. Despite the high priority afforded the technologies building by the State of Queensland, USQ did not receive any of these funds. Given the university's needs, this is incomprehensible and, indeed, insulting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth and final point is that USQ remains, very importantly, the lowest per capita funded university in Australia. During the 1980s it received from the Commonwealth only one teaching building, constructed at a cost of just $1.68m. Such shabby treatment is believed to be without parallel in higher education over this period. I conclude my remarks by quoting from a letter from Professor Leal to Minister Baldwin, dated 4 September 1992. In his final paragraph he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University has obviously been seriously disadvantaged by the timing of the implementation of the capital roll-in process. The loss of project-specific funding for the Technologies Building from 1994 has been a major blow and has been compounded by a lack of any concession or consideration in the Commonwealth's associated capital initiatives for 1992/93. If some allowance is not made to compensate the University for its major loss in this area, and some money made available to support the Technologies Building (perhaps from the proposed `discretionary pool' of $35m announced for 1994) then the future development&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of this institution and the overall quality of its programmes are in serious jeopardy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the notice of the House what I believe is one of the cheapest political stunts ever pulled. On 2 September 1992 in the State Parliament of New South Wales the Premier of New South Wales, in answering a dorothy dix question from one of his colleagues, went on to criticise as a cruel hoax:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a cynical and calculated political ploy that may create a number of short term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on being critical by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of cases, unemployment is not the criteria for those councils which get the money. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to remind the Premier of New South Wales of something. Our local newspaper described it admirably. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This windfall has offered some hope for the city's legions of unemployed. Jobs will be created as the money is used to start much-needed community projects and improve roads and drainage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Government should roll out the red carpet when dealing with Fairfield's growth plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is shameful that the State's leaders are using "big brother" politics to cast doubt on such a worthwhile program. All three tiers of government&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;should co-operate with each other to solve the nation's unemployment crisis, rather than get involved in political point-scoring.</PARA>
<PARA>There was more. Following that statement by the Premier of New South Wales on 2 September, the President of the Local Government Association in New South Wales, Alderman Peter Woods, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning local government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are sick to death of state politicians playing politics when we want to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter because following the very generous program introduced by the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) after the Budget allocation for local government works programs throughout Australia, my Council was one of those which received funding. Something like $105m has gone to New South Wales and out of that something like $9m will be spent in the Fairfield City Council area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the cooperation of Federal members, aldermen and staff an excellent program has been put together which will bring to fruition dreams that that community has had for many years but has not had the finances to achieve. They not only put together a very constructive program, bringing in capital works programs, from the erecting of buildings to roads and drainage work&mdash;work which, as I said before, has not been able to be attempted in the past&mdash;but also they completed designs and plans and presented a submission to the Association last week; all within seven days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, local government has been saying, `Give us the opportunity and the finances and we will get on with the job'. The Federal Government has provided that opportunity here. But in the State of New South Wales local councils are now being threatened that if they cannot fund the work completely within their own means they will not have their borrowing programs extended. We have to make sure that the State Government does come to the party as far as local government is concerned. These are not mickey mouse projects; these are projects which will have long term effects for the community. They will help the unemployed and, most importantly, every one of those people who finds long term employment will then be spending those dollars. As I have said before in this House, it will create that domino effect whereby the person who is earning a dollar will then spend a dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Council on the speed with which it has put those programs together. I congratulate it, too, on the way in which the work has been done. It has been evenly distributed throughout the city. The Council has looked at construction jobs, road building and drainage. I say again that we do not need cheap political stunts: we need cooperation and assistance. When we look at the $12.5m program of construction works which would be created, we see that $1.2m would not even take the loan borrowing program of Fairfield City Council up to 22 per cent. It is a very small part of its overall budget. It is a very mean and, I believe, miserable act to threaten local government and say, `Well, because we weren't consulted you're not going to get it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to all and sundry: let us get on with the job and help those people who have now become the meat in the sandwich and who have had very little cooperation from the State Government. Let us get on with the job and provide them with the opportunity to get out and work. My people need it and are crying out for it. A community as large as mine could certainly take the construction and the work which will now take place as a result of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this program will be submitted to the Federal Government next week. I think it will be to the disadvantage of the State Government if it does not consent to that loan borrowing program. Most particularly, it will be using the people of my electorate and the people of many electorates in New South Wales who have had the advantage of that funding as the meat in the sandwich. I do not think we should do that as politicians. I think we should be united. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our local press has said: roll out the red carpet. Let us get on with the job and, in particular, let us make sure that the Premier of New South Wales does not pull any more of these cheap political stunts by criticising this program. He criticised it very badly and he did it in such a way that he could not make those remarks outside the Parliament. It was misleading; it was mischievous; and, most importantly, he did not even get his facts together. As I have stated before, let us get the job done. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent announcement of the approval by Her Majesty the Queen of a medal for Australian personnel who served in support roles in Vietnam is, in the words of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), long overdue and completes unfinished business for 20,000 loyal Australians. It also underlies the continuing humbug, bureaucratic obfuscation and hypocrisy which has been practised by all Federal governments since the Second World War in their continuing failure to recognise veterans who served in campaigns from 1945 to 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over 40 years veterans and the associations that represent them have sought recognition, to no avail. It is no wonder they feel bitter, discriminated against and unfairly treated. For years they have listened to excuses and empty rhetoric. More recently, they have watched in disillusionment as Prime Ministers have cried at Gallipoli and kissed the Kokoda Trail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans from the 1939-45 war and from the campaign since 1975 have been recognised with Australian Service Medals. Why then are the men and women in the 30 years between 1945 and 1975 treated as virtual pariahs? There are the 35,000 to 40,000 service men and women in Korea from 1950 to 1953, the 10,000 plus who served in Malaya from 1948 to 1960 and the Malay Peninsula from 1964 to 1966, the 10,000 plus in Borneo from 1960 to 1966, the approximate 100 in the Berlin airlift in 1948, the hundreds in United Nations forces before 1975, and the nuclear veterans of Maralinga and Monte Bello. Many of these veterans did get recognition from foreign governments, yet it is almost inconceivable they cannot receive it from their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should publicly state why these service men and women are excluded from the sentiments of his recent speeches emphasising Australia's independence as `One Nation' free of a colonial past where all Australians should be aware and proud of the sacrifices and services given by our military veterans for Australia. These speeches had given hope to affected veterans that at last their services would be recognised. Many had also believed that formal recognition would finally come from a Prime Minister apparently determined to establish Australia as a fully independent nation, yet the recent rejection again by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price) has shown the futility of their hopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments used on that occasion as to why formal recognition could not be granted related to the imperial versus the Australian honours system, operational as opposed to non-operational services, conscription versus volunteers and that the argument that medals should only be issued with the commencement of an Australian honours system in 1975. These arguments were seen by veterans as largely rhetoric and had little basis in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsequent issue of the Vietnam logistics and support medal and the Minister's accompanying statement confirms the sophistry and hypocrisy of the Government's position. It was argued that medals could not be issued for service prior to 1975 on the grounds that the Australian honours system did not originate until that year, yet the new Vietnam award was clearly issued as `a formal award within the Australian honours system' in recognition of a service prior to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam at least three years prior to the introduction of the Australian honours system. They were withdrawn also prior to the Queen formally becoming the Queen of Australia in 1973. It is therefore quite clear that there is no reason whatsoever why the veterans of the 1945-75 era cannot be recognised under the Australian honours system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every person in these defence forces served this country as directed by the governments of the day. Many served under horrific conditions. Since it became obvious that they were to be ignored and treated as though they never existed, their anger has risen at this blatant discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar condition existed in Canada until 1991, at which time the Canadian Government formally recognised the post-1945 veterans of that country. The Canadian system operated under the same imperial honours system as Australia, yet has now found processes to provide official recognition under their own Canadian honours system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Frederick Kirkland, OAM, of Neutral Bay, a war historian and author of the works <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sometimes Forgotten</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Damask</EMPHASIS>, for his role in publicising this most unsatisfactory state of affairs and campaigning for its remedy.

I understand that the Commonwealth was to continue funding centres such as the New South Wales Handicapped Children's Centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, three States&mdash;namely, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia&mdash;have not met the guidelines of the Government's terms of this agreement. So, while the bureaucrats at both State and Federal levels argue the toss with each other, centres such as the New South Wales Handicapped Children's Centre suffer. The transition program of moving children from Rainbow Lodge to accommodation in the general community has been stopped because these funds have been frozen. This is a bureaucratic nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Handicapped Children's Centre has been trying to wind down the Rainbow Lodge facility for some time and move the residents into community cottages where they can live on their own. They were able to open three such cottages in 1990 and 1991. Many parents of the residents have contacted me to explain the advantages of community living and they have impressed upon me the gains that their children have made when they begin to live in their own homes. I fully support this transition. Because of my long association with the centre, I well know that there are considerable advantages in these people living in the community and taking part in society. It has been a noble objective of the centre for some time and, while it has always had my total support, I cannot say the same for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This transition has now come to a complete standstill because the Handicapped Children's Centre cannot receive any funding from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. While the negotiations between the relevant government authorities proceed at what appears to be a snail's pace, the centre is unable to proceed with its transition program and, importantly, those residents still at Rainbow Lodge are being denied the opportunity to live as a part of the general community. Surely the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) can act in some regard to ensure the continuation of funding for the Children's Centre so that this program of devolution may continue. One of the parents who contacted my office stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our daughter is being denied these opportunities because Minister Howe and his Department say there is no money. Why have they started this transition process without thought of the ultimate cost?</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we will have to wait until responsibility is transferred to the State governments is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA>How true. I understand that government negotiations such as the Commonwealth-State disability agreement take time. I further appreciate that the Government has set aside approximately $20.3m in the recent Budget to implement the agreement. But what good is that money to the residents at Rainbow Lodge if it remains locked away while these negotiations flounder?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: surely the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services can extend at least part of this funding to enable the winding down of Rainbow Lodge to proceed. Is it unreasonable to suggest that the gains these people make when they live in the general community do warrant some intervention from the Minister? Is it equally unreasonable to suggest that, without the intervention of the Minister, the people still housed at Rainbow Lodge are being denied these opportunities and benefits?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue in the sincere hope that this Parliament can intercede to promote the objectives of these people. Surely they are deserving of this. The parents of the children of the Handicapped Children's Centre are showing a deep concern and it is totally unfair to all concerned that everything is at a total standstill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, in recent days a number of sporting events have been held which would have been of particular interest to the constituents in Brisbane and, I would imagine, to you, with your keen interest in sporting matters across the nation. The Brisbane rugby league grand final was held last weekend and concluded the Brisbane rugby league season. I am very pleased to say that the Western Suburbs team based in my electorate was successful in winning the Brisbane rugby league grand final for the first time since 1976. I have been reminded this week of a couple of links between that 1976 team and the team which won last Sunday by a very substantial margin of 40 points to 10. Bob Green, who captained the 1976 side, had his son playing in the grand final team last Sunday and I am sure he would have been very pleased to see his son follow him, not only wearing the Brisbane Wests jersey but also succeeding in a grand final.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the gallery of this chamber we had with us a school teacher, Richie Twist, whom some honourable members may recall. He was also a Wests player in the 1976 grand final winning team. He also played for Queensland and was an outstanding second rower of the era. The people in my electorate, particularly in the suburbs of Red Hill, Ashgrove and Bardon are thrilled to see their red and black Panthers back on top of the rugby league ladder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not let the opportunity pass without also making some comment about the fact that one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game retired a fortnight ago&mdash;Wally Lewis. He is one of those players who have excited the imagination of sporting lovers throughout the nation, not only rugby league followers. He is one of those peculiar sportsmen who have attracted the attention of people across the country. There is no doubt that he has made an enormous contribution to the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will seem a little strange, as a Queenslander, going along to watch State of Origin matches at Lang Park without seeing Wally Lewis on the field. He was a brilliant player; he was a brilliant captain; and he is a brilliant coach. His efforts as captain in organising and lifting the Queensland side and the Australian side assisted both the Queensland and Australian sides to many of their victories over the last decade. The accolades which have been given to Wally Lewis by former great players are testimony to his genuine outstanding ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some regret that he ended his days not with the Brisbane Broncos. This year, with the Brisbane Broncos now minor premiers and clear favourites to win the premiership, it would have been pleasant to see Wally Lewis, who loved Brisbane and who loved Queensland, finish his playing days on the field for the Brisbane Broncos, winning the 1992 grand final in front of a Sydney crowd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other things that I wish to mention which are also occurring this week that are of great interest to the people in Brisbane. You may know that the State school soccer carnival is on here in Canberra this week and that there are teams from all around Australia competing. There are three teams from Queensland involved in that competition&mdash;a boys primary school side, a boys secondary school team and a girls secondary school team. I had the pleasure of watching part of one of those games on Monday of this week and I was impressed by the standard of play. I was particularly pleased to see girls playing in that sport and being given some recognition for their skill and dedication to the game. I am also pleased to say that all three Queensland teams have won their two opening games and I wish them well as the week unfolds and as the tournament draws to a close at the end of this week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia Post uses conventional commercial accounting techniques to measure the revenue and costs attributable to Registered Publications. The cost allocation methodology for the Registered Publications service was examined by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) as part of its 1991 Inquiry into the Supply of Postal Services. The PSA noted that the cost allocation methodology could result in losses being overstated. However, the PSA was satisfied that the loss on Registered Publications was directly attributable to the cost of delivery of magazines on a national basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As the Registered Publications service is a competitive one, cost details are considered commercial in confidence. The net loss on the service for 1989/90 was $27.5 million and for 1990/91, $21.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. The analysis undertaken by Australia Post showed that in addition to the overall subsidy which Registered Publications receive from other postal services (ie its loss), there were also some cross subsidies within the service eg from fully pre-sorted, lightweight items, travelling short distances, to the heavier unsorted publications travelling long distances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes. A commercial assessment of moving publications away from the Registered Publications service to a new cost based service was undertaken. It showed that some publications would benefit from a disaggregated charging structure, whilst many who would face increases under such a system would have advertising as a source of income to offset such increases. This led to the conclusion that a phased closure of the Registered Publications service was desirable as well as easing of the restrictions on advertising content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. Apart from its reserved services, Australia Post has no basis for price discrimination other than on commercial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. The delivery of Registered Publications is not a service reserved to Australia Post, nor is it a statutory community service obligation. Australia Post's community service obligations are defined under S.27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1987. The Act defines Australia Post's obligations to supply a letter service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Yes. Estimates of the cost of community service obligations are included in the Corporation's Annual Reports which are tabled in the Parliament as required under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of fulfilling Australia Post's community service obligations in 1990/91 using the avoidable cost method is estimated at $60 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Yes. Under section 36 of the Act, Australia Post's Corporate Plan is to contain a statement of strategies and policies that Australia Post is to follow in order to meet its community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Corporate Plan for the new triennium beginning in 1992/93 has been approved by the Board and submitted to me as Minister. That Plan contains a statement of the strategies and policies concerning community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As required by section 43 of the Act, the latest report on the strategies and policies relating to community service obligations will be included in Australia Post's 1991/92 Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Strategies for reducing the costs of community service obligations are linked to Australia Post's core commercial strategies and policies, including labour and total factor productivity. Therefore, strategies to improve the efficiency of the postal service as a whole, and efficiency in the delivery of community service obligations, are set out in the Corporate Plan for the next triennium which has been approved by the Board and submitted to me as Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a direct consequence of the pursuit of efficiency objectives, the costs of operating the business improve and, with that, the scope for reducing the cost of meeting its community service obligations increases while service quality is maintained or improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Australia Post uses conventional accounting techniques to determine direct costs and to attribute indirect costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Australia Post has investigated both general cost control and specific access restriction measures with a view to improving the profitability of the Registered Publications service. In 1989, it imposed a $5 cover price limit and tighter eligibility conditions for certain publications produced by businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Yes. Given that the distribution of publications is highly competitive, details of the contracts are commercially confidential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreements have only been made with major customers where there has been a commercial advantage in doing so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Industry Commission report on Rail Transport was considered at the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting on 10 April 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission Report was also considered at the Heads of Government meeting on 11 May 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government issued its own response to the Industry Commission Report on 31 July 1992.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Coopers and Lybrand were not responsible for organising the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). Coopers and Lybrand were appointed to scrutinise and count the ballots cast at the meeting. I am informed that as at 17 August 1992 the Coopers and Lybrand account has not been finalised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first allegation was that ballot papers had been given to proxy holders on the day of the AGM without lodgement of the approved form at least seven days before the meeting. However the AWC concluded that the persons concerned were voting as authorised representatives of companies and partnerships rather than proxy holders. While the relevant regulations prescribe procedures for recognising proxy voters, the position of representatives of non-natural persons entitled to vote at the meeting is governed by the general law. For this reason, the AWC took the view that it could provide ballot papers to a person who, on the day of the AGM, was able to establish his or her credentials either as an authorised representative named by the relevant wool-tax payer in the registration application form or appointed by the tax-payer  in substitution for that representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second allegation related to whether proxy appointments lodged by facsimile were proxies lodged in the approved form as set out in the legislation.

These Guidelines state that the choice of procurement method for a project is influenced by the extent of effective competition available; the volume and character of the services or supplies required; and the need to achieve value for money. Determinants of the choice include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the requirement, quantity, timeframe, administration and purchasing costs. To meet these requirements a variety of procurement techniques, including public tendering, may be utilised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No, it is not correct that a recent estimate of a screwworm fly outbreak in the Wet in northern Australia could kill 90 per cent of calves and 30 per cent of cows. However, at a meeting convened recently by Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) experts with representatives of the Queensland cattle industry as part of a consequence modelling project being funded by my Department under the Screwworm Fly strategy, it was estimated that 90 per cent of calves and 30 per cent of cows that were struck by the screwworm fly may die if not treated. The QDPI have advised that the estimate of deaths for screwworm fly struck calves has since been revised to 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are estimates based on the scientific literature from overseas, most of which relates to a similar but different screwworm fly, Cochlyomia hominovorax, the New World Screwworm Fly, found in the central and south Americas. As the screwworm fly nearest Australia, Chrysomya bezziana, the Old World Screwworm Fly, has fortunately never occurred in Australia it is not possible to accurately determine the level of livestock deaths that may occur in the event of an outbreak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia is one of the few countries with a tropical climate that is free of screwworm fly. The Old World Screwworm Fly is present across tropical Africa, in the Middle East and in south and south east Asia as far as Papua New Guinea. It does not occur further east in the Pacific island nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New World Screwworm Fly is present in central America south of Mexico and tropical South America. It has been eradicated from the southern United States of America and Mexico, although there have been recent reports of isolated reinfestations in parts of Mexico. The only occurrence of the New World Screwworm Fly establishing outside the Americas was in 1988 when it was introduced into Libya. Subsequently, an international eradication program controlled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation successfully eliminated the infestation. Libya was again declared free of the New World Screwworm Fly on 22 June 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The decision to ban smoking in airport terminals was based on domestic factors and conditions. Practice at other airports with different domestic factors and conditions was not considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The ban on smoking is a total ban in all parts of FAC airport terminals. The Corporation's policy,</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC did investigate the option of providing designated smoking facilities.
