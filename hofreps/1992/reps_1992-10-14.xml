<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill is about making alterations to Austudy. I am delighted to see that the Minister responsible, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), is in the chamber this morning. Over the last 2 1/2 years he and I have had a number of very active debates in this place regarding Austudy and the provision of higher education in general. I congratulate the Minister on getting something right for a change. Well done!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Bill is about introducing, into our system of student financial assistance, student loans referred to in the Bill as `supplements'. I point out to honourable members that student loans have been on the agenda for a very long time, but this Government has been afraid to talk about student loans and still denies that opportunity in the language used in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night in this debate the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) spent some time criticising the concept of student loans as being inequitable. Yet he fully supports the concept of supplements, which in essence are student loans, taken out by students in giving up some of their entitlements to the grant of Austudy. In his second reading speech the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has one of world's best student financial support schemes, which is one reason we have one of the world's most equitable higher education systems.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I would go along with the Minister on that point. We have had many active debates in this place regarding student financial assistance&mdash;Austudy and Abstudy. One of the reasons for that is that the system, as it has evolved, has been shown to have many inequities. One of its principal negatives is the fact that it has been very poor at targeting assistance to those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate last night the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), well outlined to the Government many of the problems that have surfaced through the years and that we have brought to the attention of the Government in the operation of Austudy. Not the least of those is the fact that until very recently the Government did not even have a statement of real objectives for the scheme&mdash;that is, the Government had not set out in clear English what the scheme was meant to accomplish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my viewpoint, what student financial assistance ought to be all about very simply is making sure that no eligible student is denied access to education because of financial constraints. It then becomes a matter of deciding who has financial constraints, under what manner these are caused, whether or not it is proper, right and reasonable for the Government to help those who need assistance and how to go about targeting those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a very damning report on student financial assistance. It was reported widely in the press; debates were held on public radio and on television. I think very sincerely that that report has helped shape the debate on student financial assistance throughout the remaining time of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very good report, and it was a bipartisan effort. We said to the Government, `You have not set proper objectives for Austudy. You have not said what it is all about. Whatever those objectives are, it appears to us that you have not met them well. The system is not equitable, it is subject to rort and abuse, and it does not necessarily achieve the objectives set out'. I note that this year we are spending $1.65 billion on student financial assistance. Make no mistake about it: that is a great deal of money in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report of March 1991 canvassed many things that the Government might do in order to modify the Austudy scheme to make it more equitable. I know that a number of the things that we recommended then have been picked up in the Budget Papers, but we have yet to see the detail from the Government on those particular items. I will return to those later. That March 1991 report set the standard for the debate. Many of the recommendations that we made have already been picked up and put into place in Austudy. Following on from that, initiatives have been announced in this Budget which pick up even more of the items that we recommended at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just after that report was issued, I wrote a discussion paper on student financial assistance for the 1990s. My report canvassed essentially what is happening in the rest of the world and how the rest of the world has gone about approaching this issue of assisting students with their financial needs while they are in full time study. Essentially, the discussion paper found that most of the rest of the world has moved away from total reliance on grant schemes in favour of loans to students, generally interest free, generally over a long period of time and generally repaid at some time after students have finished their education and are in a financially better position to pay back the money which they used during their study time. The loan scheme is, in essence, anticipated income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The governments of those countries that support loan schemes do so knowing that the majority of students will earn higher incomes because of the qualifications that they obtained from the study. So they are asked to repay that loan money. In other words, they forgo income while they are studying and repay the loan later when they are in work. In my discussion paper I recommended a whole range of options that we should consider. Some of those have been picked up by the Government through legislation on the Austudy scheme and some, no doubt, we will continue to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1992 Dr Bruce Chapman gave to the Minister another report on Austudy. But before he did, in November 1991 the Opposition gave to the Australian public our Fightback package. The Fightback package spelled out a number of major changes that we in the Opposition thought were necessary to help make Austudy more equitable. Included in those are some of the items that were announced in the Budget in September, which we will debate later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chapman report was really in two phases. It came about because, following the House of Representatives Committee report on Austudy and my discussion paper, the Minister made a decision that he needed outside advice away from the constraints of the Department of Employment, Education and Training on how best to go about modifying the student financial assistance scheme to make it more equitable and cost efficient. So he commissioned Dr Bruce Chapman to inquire into the whole issue of student financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman wrote a preliminary report which was directed towards a major change in terms of our balance. We currently have a total reliance on grants to assist students. That means that someone decides, through some bureaucratic mechanism, who needs financial assistance, how much financial assistance is needed, and how it will be given to each particular student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his preliminary report Dr Chapman came down on balance for replacing a reasonable portion of the grant scheme with loans to students in lieu of the grant. That created a big ruckus. Students and the student unions went hell for leather in criticising Dr Chapman. In fact, they made life really miserable for him on his and other campuses. It was a vociferous debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, students have a vested interest in student financial assistance and its mechanisms, and I well understand that. They should be concerned. But for some reason they seemed to believe that it was equitable to decide that one individual, because of that person's parents' financial circumstances, was entitled to a grant but another individual, because of his or her parents' financial circumstances, was not to be entitled to a grant. That determination may not pick up the fact that, regardless of their financial circumstances, the parents may not be willing to support the student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, after Dr Chapman brought down his preliminary report he and the Minister had discussions. He revised his format and in April 1992 brought down a final report, which brings us to this debate. Although the Government has neglected to address many of the recommendations in the Chapman report, it has picked up one of them. This Bill, which is about supplements&mdash;in fact, a student loan scheme&mdash;was one of the options that the Chapman report proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the provision of student loans in lieu of grants is a proper way to go. I have no doubt that grants have a place to play in the system, but it is my own belief that many students are disadvantaged by the grants scheme itself and that there are others who need financial assistance but are targeted out by the scheme, such as those who have no means of helping themselves other than through some kind of loan mechanism&mdash;and the banks certainly are not interested in providing students even with high interest loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several reasons for looking at loans in lieu of grants. The first of those, and probably the most important altogether, is targeting. Targeting is particularly difficult. All of us have a desire to see that people get the money that they need. That is inherent in this debate. It is not really a political debate. It is not about ideology; it is not about Left or Right or centre or anything else; it is really about trying to make sure that young people particularly who need and deserve an education have the opportunity to receive that education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our travels around the country, in talking to various groups about the grants scheme, we have found that many students who come from middle income backgrounds today are severely disadvantaged. They are probably the most disadvantaged in terms of student financial assistance of any group in the student society. The reason is that increasingly&mdash;the recession may have something to do with it, but changes in our society probably have something to do with it also&mdash;numbers of parents are saying to their children, `When you finish high school you are on your own; you can go off to university. Yes, the Government pays for the majority of your costs at university, but you will have to figure out how to support yourself, because we have looked after you up to this point and we are not willing to contribute any more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other young people who have lost their parents. Also, unfortunately, in society today many families have broken down and young people literally do not have a family to assist them. Students of middle income parents are probably the most disadvantaged group and are very difficult to target. The loans provide supplementary income for some students for whom it is particularly difficult, and in times of recession impossible, to find part time jobs in order to support themselves. Our Standing Committee certainly supports students working to help put themselves through tertiary education. I certainly worked to put myself through university. Nobody else was going to do it for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been successful in convincing the Government to raise the limit on student earnings before killing a student's opportunity to receive a grant. That has been very positive. One of the most negative things about our grants scheme in early 1990 was that so many students attempted to rort the system because the income base that they were allowed before they started losing 50c in the dollar of their Austudy grant was very low. Now at least it is set at a reasonable level, and it appears that it will continue to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been changes in eligibility to Austudy grants through this Budget and through earlier mechanisms. Those changes in eligibility prevent some students from receiving the Austudy grant. This supplementary mechanism, this student loan mechanism, contained within the Bill now gives those students some opportunity to defer income so that they can take up a loan now and pay it back on an interest free basis when they are earning a good income. The Budget has several other mechanisms that will affect Austudy, but we have yet to see the detail in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget announces a lower age of independence. Our Committee certainly supported that. It was one of our major recommendations. The Government has not gone as far as we would like to go; nonetheless, this measure is an improvement in the right direction. The Budget says that the value of some fringe benefits will be included as being income for testing of parental support. That is a very positive initiative because part of the rorting of the system, as seen by the public, has been the ability of some individuals to use the taxation system to their benefit: to take low apparent incomes and use those low apparent incomes to fund assets. The income and assets test still allows the students to receive grants while their parents are quite capable financially of supporting their students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see what items the Government picks up in terms of fringe benefits&mdash;things such as personal superannuation, things subject to the fringe benefits tax, and negative gearing on property. I look forward to receiving the detail of the Government's intentions in this regard. The Budget says that debt management expects to pull in another $7.5m in overpayment to students who did not deserve the payment. Our side of politics and the audit group see that there is great scope for improvement in that, because $7 1/2m is a very small portion of the amount which is probably currently being taken out of the system when it should not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also picks up a coalition and Committee initiative in raising the level of the minimum payment for Austudy. Very small payments of $10 or $15 a week are still sent out to students, which is clearly a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, I think, to this Government's credit that it has brought this legislation in. Despite the flowery rhetoric of calling them supplements instead of student loans, the Government has introduced the legislation in defiance of a massive lobby from students who say it is only the thin end of the wedge. The students argue that once the door is open to student loans the Government will increasingly reduce the grants scheme and increase reliance on student loans. That may well be true, because the rest of the world has very clearly moved in that direction in the 1980s and the 1990s and probably will continue to do so. The targeting is very clear. If a student needs the money, the opportunity to defer income in order to obtain living expenses at the time provides the best targeting mechanism available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to enter this debate in support of the Government's legislation enhancing the Austudy-Abstudy provisions of the education system. I would like at the outset to endorse some of the remarks made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) about the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that was undertaken in 1990-91. The work of that Committee set the direction for much of the debate which has occurred during the life of this Parliament on key aspects of Austudy and Abstudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important also in that context to acknowledge the contribution made by the then chairperson of the Committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price)&mdash;now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence&mdash;who performed an outstanding job as chairperson in conducting that inquiry. Along with a number of other members of this place, I was pleased to be a part of that inquiry, and I think its report is one which the Parliament can be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party has a long and proud history of supporting and improving access and equity in education, particularly in post-compulsory education. The concept of needs based assistance&mdash;of targeting money to those most in need&mdash;was introduced into these systems by a Labor government in the 1970s. Since 1983, this Government has expanded and improved on that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the number of secondary students in receipt of income support has increased by a massive 350 per cent; the number of tertiary students in receipt of support has increased by an enormous 125 per cent. Nearly half of all tertiary students are now able to receive financial assistance from the Government to enable them to undertake their studies. In many cases, I have no doubt that they would not be able to undertake those studies were it not for the targeted support provided by the Government through the Austudy and Abstudy systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the number of people in receipt of benefits increased; the actual value of the benefit has improved over time. The real value of maximum benefits has increased by 11 per cent. After taking account of the cost of inflation, since 1983 there has been an 11 per cent increase in the real support provided to students in receipt of Austudy at the tertiary level. At the secondary level, the increase in real terms is a very substantial 115 per cent. That, of course, has a lot to do with the changes which were also made to the benefits for unemployed people some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year over half a million Australians will be in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy. Some 556,000 Australians will be in receipt of that benefit next year. That indicates the wide penetration which the system has achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I would like to pick up a couple of the comments that were included in the parliamentary Committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student Financial Assistance </EMPHASIS>of 1991 which need to be fleshed out for further action. The honourable member for La Trobe referred to those people who are able to structure their income and their assets to become asset rich but income poor. They are able to manage their income and affairs to reduce their taxable income so that they fall below the cut-off point and thereby are able to gain various government benefits, including Austudy, when in fact by any standard they have a wealthy lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to people who through fringe benefits and other arrangements that they are able to enter into with their employers, or self-employed people who so structure their affairs, have their standards of living met by the company and not through their taxable income. Those people are ripping off the system. The Committee made it quite clear in its report that the days of students rolling up at university in a Mercedes Benz or BMW and picking up Austudy had to stop. This is not an easy thing to fix because the taxable income, which is the basis upon which most of these systems operate, does not adequately address the problem. The Committee made recommendations on this aspect  and I am aware it is being considered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly urge the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and the Government to ensure that action is taken to better direct the payments so that those people who are genuinely in need, who have not rorted the system and rearranged their assets to reduce their tax liabilities, should receive the benefit. No-one is suggesting that people go out and rearrange their income and assets just to get Austudy. Austudy happens to be one of the fringe benefits they pick up along the way. It is important that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, through consultations with the Taxation Office, ensure that mechanisms are set in place to catch those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the people who are subjected to the means test for dependent spouse benefit. The Government took a decision, I think two Budgets ago, to alter that means test and in the process prevented a number of people completing studies. I think that was a very regrettable decision and it was commented upon in the report. I fear that time has probably now passed those people by. Nevertheless, I believe that those people&mdash;most of whom were women, people from low income families who were seeking to re-enter the work force and requiring training&mdash;do deserve particular consideration on the basis of equity and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Government will be able to review the situation for those people who were in the system a couple of years ago but who have been forced to drop out. I am not suggesting that we continue the old rules in perpetuity, but I think there is a case for a sunset clause to phase out the old arrangement. The Committee made recommendations along those lines. I hope those matters will also be looked at by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill specifically introduces a supplement for recipients of Austudy and Abstudy that is designed to enable certain students to gain additional funds over and above their existing entitlements to benefit. The supplement will be available to tertiary students who are now eligible for grants through Austudy or Abstudy. It applies only to tertiary students and not to secondary students. The students will gain access to the supplement by trading in $1 of their grant to secure $2 of a supplement. In each year, the amount of the supplement available to a student will be between $500 and $4,000. It is a significant opportunity for those students who wish to do so to access a substantial amount of money to aid them during their years of study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement is also available to some students who are now not eligible for Austudy or Abstudy. Special provision has been made for those students who would otherwise be eligible for a grant, except that their parental income is too high, where that parental income is less than $50,000. This will extend the assistance provided by the Government to tertiary students much further and will introduce a whole new group of people to financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing this supplement the Government has recognised that student needs vary substantially. Not all students have the same opportunity or the same access, for example, to casual employment, depending on where they may live, what their family circumstances are and what their community obligations and commitments are. Similarly, not all students have the same costs to bear, again depending on family circumstances and where they live. The cost of accommodation in the capital cities of Australia varies markedly, and of course the cost of accommodation in regional Australia is different again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity for students to choose, if they wish, to access the supplement will enable those students who for a variety of reasons need the extra cash to get the money when they most need it, while they are studying. The grants are indexed to maintain real value. That is an important characteristic which the Government is entrenching in legislation. I welcome that initiative. It provides some certainty for the students of Australia about their ongoing income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement will be paid fortnightly along with the grants. I would like to make a couple of comments about how the system is to operate, because I think the Government in introducing this has managed to allay many of the concerns which were raised by student bodies. I guess first and foremost in that process was the indexation of the grants to ensure that the grants will continue to rise in line with the consumer price index. The repayments have been arranged in a very generous manner. There is no real interest rate applying on the supplement whatsoever. Outstanding balances&mdash;the amount owing&mdash;will be indexed to the CPI. So there is no effective rate of interest charged to students who choose to access this supplement. Moreover, there is no requirement to make any repayment at all for five years. That guarantees the students the opportunity of completing their courses and establishing themselves in their new careers before they are required to make any payments whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point the repayments are in accordance with the existing HECS arrangements, and that seems to me to be quite appropriate. If students are in a position to make repayments within the first five years they are given an additional benefit by way of a 15 per cent discount. That is an inducement for those students to strive to make the repayment as early as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am happy to support this Bill and the supplement that is provided for in it, I should record my general concern about loans based systems. The Government has proposed a continuation of an Austudy grant which is targeted according to a person's income and assets. That is a wholly proper and equitable system that we should follow. The Government is building on that the opportunity, the choice, individually determined by each student, to trade in some of that benefit to get a loan. That stands in stark contrast to a concept of loans which has been promulgated by the Opposition at various times and was referred to by the honourable member for La Trobe just a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a supplement, a loans based system is I think  acceptable. As a sole system, it reduces equity and does nothing but help the rich. One cannot say that a loans based system is targeted in any way. A loans based system ensures that the rich&mdash;the students of rich families&mdash;have no trouble accessing tertiary education because they can take out a loan at low interest rates. And why would they not? If people could get a subsidised interest rate loan they would take it rather than use their own money or go to the bank. They would take out a low interest rate loan, and if they were wealthy that would be no problem. Such students have guaranteed repayment. Under this arrangement they can pay the loan off when they like, within the first five years, and get a benefit that ordinary Australians&mdash;low income and middle income Australians&mdash;do not have access to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a grants system is replaced with a loans system, rather than supplementing one with the other as we have, it ensures that the only people who are guaranteed access to tertiary education are the wealthy. The ordinary income earner in Australia is not in a position to guarantee the sort of money which would be required. I will come to that later when I refer to some of the other proposals that the Opposition has produced on this matter, particularly with respect to vouchers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to record in this debate that the Government is not about introducing a loan system; the Government is about providing the opportunity for some students to trade in part of their grant to get a loan, if they wish. We should never lose sight of the need for a grants system targeted to those in need, to those with the ability to succeed in education&mdash;to those who would otherwise not have the economic means to complete their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition in its Fightback package has proposed a number of initiatives which would severely injure tertiary students. For starters, we cannot go past its goods and services tax which, by its own admission, would increase inflation by about 4 to 6 per cent, depending upon what analysis we look at. That is the rise in the CPI. It has compensated Austudy payments with an increase of 5 per cent and has said, therefore, that tertiary students will be no worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that the GST will cause higher inflation, but that it will give an increase to Austudy of the same amount. That takes no account of the fact that students who are predominantly low income earners spend most of their money on food and services&mdash;things which do not attract any direct wholesale sales tax. Therefore, the increase in their weekly expenditure is not 4 to 6 per cent; it is of the order of 8 to 12 per cent. I do not have time to go through that debate in detail, but it certainly has been one waged on the airwaves and in this place in recent times. It is beyond doubt that low income earners spend a much higher proportion of their income on food and services, they will be the worst hit by a GST and they will not be compensated by a 5 per cent increase in Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that flaws the Opposition's argument when it comes to compensation is its assumption that all the savings it proposes for business, through reducing wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and other taxes, will be passed on to the consumer&mdash;you and me&mdash;when we go and buy a product. Those opposite would have us believe that none of the companies in the chain of production will decide to keep a little of that for themselves to increase their profit margin. That is an unrealistic assumption. It was one of the bases upon which their economic analysis was flawed from the outset. They double counted that. When they went to the business community, they said, `We will take all these imposts off you so that your profits will be greater'. Then they went to the people of Australia and said, `We will take all these imposts off businesses and they will pass it on to you so that you will get cheaper goods'. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot use the same pool of money to give the companies more profits and the consumers cheaper prices. It is one or the other. The truth is that the 6 per cent compensation which the Opposition proposes for Austudy will not address the increases in prices that will occur due to the profit taking that I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, though, I think members of the Opposition have proposed a dangerous policy which threatens the equity in our education system, by supporting a voucher concept. I thought vouchers fell out of favour in the 1970s. I am a little surprised that they have been recycled in the 1990s. Vouchers take no account of the costs of separate courses. A tertiary course can cost between $8,000 and $25,000 a year depending on what faculty a student is studying in&mdash;whether he or she is doing medicine, engineering or arts. Obviously different programs have different in-built costs. If a student gets a voucher that is averaged out, that does not give him or her the flexibility to do a course which he or she may be capable of doing unless the student happens to be wealthy enough to pay the balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a voucher system inevitably does, and has done everywhere it has been applied, is to restrict the choices for capable, intelligent students from low income families whilst at the same time providing more choices for the wealthy but less able students. It shifts the emphasis from ability to wealth. A voucher does not target those in need but effectively ensures that the wealthy have greater access than they do now and the poor have less access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To top it all off, those opposite then flirt with the idea of imposing up-front fees, so before students can even get in they have to pay up front. Those opposite say that students can pay up front because they will give them a voucher. Yes, that is true, but only true in the context I have just mentioned. It is true if students doing one of the high cost courses are wealthy enough to pay the balance. It is true if students are wealthy and do not get a voucher because they can front up and pay the bill anyway. But students who are capable, intelligent but poor will miss the boat. That is not good enough for Australia; it is not good enough for our future. There are a few things in this life that we should guarantee but one of them is that all people in this country have the right to a complete education to the full extent of their ability, irrespective of their means. That is the basis upon which this Government has developed its policy. Regrettably, it is not the basis upon which the Opposition policy is developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speaker who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), has said that every Australian should have the right to a full education up to the limits of his ability, and so he should. But the present Government is denying 50,000 Australian students or more who have qualified to go to tertiary institutions from obtaining a place in those institutions. It is denying them a place even if they want, from their own personal resources or with family support, to pay the full fees so that they can go to those institutions. The Labor Party, the present Government, has been muddle headed in its whole approach to the rights for Australian citizens and Australian students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look for a moment at the broader picture. It is argued that all Australians should have a right to income security, but a person who is self-reliant is denied a social security pension and is paying taxes to pay social security pensions for many people who could have afforded to be self-reliant. Similarly, it is argued that a person has a right to health cover and health insurance protection. But the Labor Government denies people the opportunity to insure for the gap; it denies people the opportunity to insure against medical expenses above the schedule fee. Where it does allow people to insure privately, it makes them pay twice. They pay for the poor, which everyone is prepared to do. Everyone acknowledges that as a social duty those with means should meet the expenses of the poor. Those people who privately insure for hospital expenses find that they have to pay taxes at a level sufficient to pay for the Medicare cover of many people on incomes higher than their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued that all people have a right to nursing home care if they are frail and elderly and qualify medically. But if people have that care delivered to them in their own homes they are largely denied any benefits at all. If a person goes to a home and wants more care than the nursing homes are funded for, that person is not allowed to privately pay for that extra care. So where are the rights of the individual and the freedom of choice in the allocation of an individual's resources?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to education, we have recognised that it is a right to have primary and secondary education, yet this Government continues to impose a price on choice because there is free education&mdash;or largely free education&mdash;in a state run school but parents have to pay much more for the choice of sending their children to an independent school. Yet, in doing so, and while doing so, they have to meet their liability for taxation&mdash;and the tax burden is increased because in many instances those parents are paying taxes to provide state school education for people on incomes much higher than their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is true when we turn to tertiary education. It is interesting here that we have two schemes in operation which in isolation seem to be muddled. But, if we were to sweep away all the institutional fabric that we now have and start with a clean slate, we might find that in those arrangements is the germ of a sensible idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a higher education contribution scheme under which students at our universities must pay about 20 per cent of the cost of their tertiary education or post-compulsory education. We now have this Student Assistance Amendment Bill under which Austudy grants, in addition to being made available on an income-assets test basis, can be converted into a loan arrangement. The germ of the idea in both of those proposals is that we are looking at life cycle accounting. We are saying that we understand that most people do their tertiary education when they are young, before they have had any earnings, before they have built up any personal wealth; and that they could not afford it but for government support for fees and government support for living expenses through Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are recognising that, yes, those who do post-compulsory education do benefit society, but they also benefit themselves. There is clear evidence that the earnings of tertiary graduates are substantially higher than the earnings of those in our community who have not had a tertiary education. There were 700,000 graduates in Australia in 1989-90 who earned a mean gross annual income of $42,700 compared with a community average, which included the average of the graduates, of $28,920. So university education provided those people with a bonus in their income earning capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a view that university education should be available to all; that university education should be provided in a way that all who get it pay for it. Before explaining how I believe that should happen, let us look at primary and secondary education. It is quite clear that primary and secondary education, and even kindergarten education, should be available to everyone. It should be universally available, it should be free and it should be availed of by all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that such education is free, the freedom should be a freedom to receive that education at whatever qualified institution one wishes, whether a state school or an independent school. Every parent should receive, on behalf of a child undergoing that primary or secondary education, a full value credit to use that credit&mdash;call it voucher if you will&mdash;at whatever institution the parent chooses as being the appropriate place for that child to be educated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we would have a truly universal, compulsory and free system of education. We should not continue to use people's choice of different educational institutions as an indirect means of taxing them. We need a fundamental reform of the tax system, the system under which we deliver the value of free education to every child, society having appropriately said that that education, up to a certain level, shall be compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the compulsory level, we need to ask ourselves whether there is anything different. Are we going to say that post-secondary education is available to all but will not be availed of by all because it is not going to be compulsory? If it is available to all, all people should have the opportunity and means of paying for it. We should not limit the number of places at universities to a number 50,000 less than those who want to go. We have to change the funding arrangements so that all those who want to avail themselves of post-secondary education, or post-compulsory education&mdash;however one chooses to describe it&mdash;can have that education. Furthermore, we need to have a system under which they can afford to have that education. Dr Chapman, in his report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy:</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a More </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flexible Approach</EMPHASIS>, had some interesting observations to make. In relation to Austudy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that the current arrangements sometimes target ineffectually, basically because there is relatively little sensitivity shown to the varied financial needs and circumstances of the potential clientele. The essential challenge for reform is to improve the targeting so as to ensure that the right amount of assistance is delivered to those who most need it.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. I agree that every student going to a post-compulsory educational institution needs assistance. Assistance should be available to every student going to those institutions. Whether it is for living allowances or for fees, under our present HECS arrangement students pay about 20 per cent, on average, of the cost of their education. Dr Chapman went on to talk about that aspect too. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . governments need to be concerned with post-compulsory education because the education process delivers major benefits to society. The challenge is to understand the nature of these benefits, why government intervention might be needed to maximise them, and what forms this intervention should take to ensure maximum effectiveness</PARA>
<PARA>I am not convinced that the way of government intervention to achieve maximum benefits for society is through providing financial assistance to those who go to tertiary institutions and making it available free and at public expense&mdash;at the expense of many who do not have the skills or the opportunity or who do not make the choice to go to tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do I go from there? I argue that the fees that should be charged to students should be the full cost of their education at post-compulsory institutions. Shock, horror! People would say, `How would students pay for it?'. Students would pay for it in exactly the same way as they pay now under the HECS arrangement. We are moving to a system where we are lowering the general level of taxation. Those who benefit from public expenditure should, as they benefit and as their incomes rise 48 per cent above the average income, be prepared to reimburse society for the resources that were expended upon them. I do not believe that it is necessarily appropriate to say to other taxpayers that because they get some benefit from those who go to universities, they should be paying taxes for them. The amount of that benefit is a quite arbitrary assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I believe that every student should be granted an Austudy living allowance and that it should be recoverable under the HECS system. Whether that student is supported by family or by his or her own efforts, by taking part time or full time work at the time or before he enters his or her university course, should be a matter of individual choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I read a lot of interesting things in Dr Chapman's report, I feel that to some extent he has been locked in by the tunnel vision that we have that society must make some payment towards the cost of education. What society should be doing is using its resources to ensure that those who undertake post-compulsory education have the means to pay for it. That would be a public sector cost, because we would have to pay for that education while people are undertaking it, we would have to pay for those students' living allowances while they are doing their study and then recover it in the future. If we moved to a system whereby there was full cost recovery, by the Government providing that education and charging it through HECS or an equivalent system to the Austudy arrangements, I am sure the Government could encourage everyone who wished and had the ability to undertake post-secondary education to complete their courses for the benefit of the nation and make the contribution to society that Dr Chapman talks about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time I have been arguing that there is a need for us to look at a fundamental reshaping of the general settlement that exists between government and people. There needs to be a change in the relationship between individuals and the state. That changed settlement, that changed social contract, for the 1990s and into the next century should be based on three key principles. Firstly, there should be a key principle that the taxation regime in this country should increasingly reflect the notion that capacity to pay is a function not just of income but also of the extent to which that income is used to meet important social responsibilities and the extent to which the community has invested above the community standard in the generation of that income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to adopt that principle, and adopt it fully, we would have to do so on the basis of a taxpayer having an income life cycle. In those circumstances, people could pay according to their capacity to pay and could draw on the system according to their need&mdash;whether they were a student or whether they were choosing to educate their children in private schools. The whole principle could go on right across the range of social expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle upon which this new social compact should be based should be a moral principle that there is a fundamental responsibility in any civilised community to ensure that individuals, if they are able, pay their own way and discharge their duties towards dependent others. Individuals who discharge these duties should not be disadvantaged for doing for themselves what society would otherwise have to do for them. Often if we do something for ourselves we pay the taxes to meet the social expenditure of many others whose incomes are greater than our own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax system needs that fundamental change on the basis that it is a moral responsibility of every citizen to meet his or her social expenditures, health expenditures, retirement income expenditures, education expenditures and expenditure for dependants. But meeting those expenditures causes a reduction in the capacity to pay tax over a life cycle. That incapacity to pay should be fully recognised. The only tax burden that should be imposed upon people in accordance with that arrangement is that which relates to those who could not afford to meet those social responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final principle upon which the compact should be based is the administrative principle that it is not necessary for government to collect taxes from the self-reliant and then give it back to them in cash or kind, or to own and operate hospitals, schools or superannuation funds. People should be left with their own resources to spend them as they choose, provided they meet their social responsibilities, which should be clearly spelled out as a part of a new social compact between government and individuals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief comments in summing up the debate. It seems that all speakers in this debate have expressed support for the legislation before the House, so I thank all honourable members for that. However, we have the usual rhetorical points that come up in debate. The sort of rhetoric we find in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is consistent with motions he has moved on previous occasions when education matters have been debated in this House. His amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the House condemns the Government for its failure to adequately address the problems in the administration and targeting of student financial assistance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that over the last few years we had, in a fairly comprehensive way, moved to achieve a better targeting of Austudy assistance. Over the last couple of Budgets we have made a number of very significant reforms, including those that liberalise the operation of the parental income test. We have extended Austudy eligibility to a broader range of courses and course combinations than were available before. We have made the scheme more flexible by allowing students completing their education to receive Austudy for an additional period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole range of incremental improvements have been made to Austudy in the couple of Budgets preceding the most recent one. But in this most recent Budget we have announced rather more comprehensive reforms to the student financial assistance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reforms were based on a number of reports. We had the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Its report made a series of recommendations which have been considered very seriously by government, and a number of those have been picked up. We also commissioned Dr Chapman of the ANU to look in a more fundamental way at the structure of student assistance and to tackle some of the more difficult issues to do with the way the scheme was targeted. Some of those issues are conceptually quite complex and difficult, and we recognise the need at this time to look in a fundamental way at the structure of Austudy. The changes that have been announced in the Budget, of which this legislation implements an important part, flowed from Dr Chapman's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see how we can be accused of failing to address the problem of targeting Austudy, given the sorts of initiatives we have undertaken over the past couple of years. We have made incremental improvements and we have taken action in response to the very thorough review by Dr Chapman. I take this opportunity to say that I think the final report from Dr Chapman was an excellent piece of analysis that has proved very useful to government. I place on record the Government's thanks to Dr Chapman for his work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to what the honourable member for Goldstein said in respect of what happened earlier in the year when we had before us Dr Chapman's draft report. That draft report proposed not an optional trade-in loan arrangement of the kind that is being implemented in this legislation. The original draft of Dr Chapman's report advocated that students, after the second or third year of study, would be required to substitute a loan for their grant payment. The Government's view was that that had some significant problems, and I thought it appropriate to place that on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it would be possible to say, as the honourable member for Goldstein said at the time, that that earlier version of Dr Chapman's recommendations was unambiguously progressive. I do not see how a scheme could be unambiguously progressive when a number of students who are the beneficiaries of maximum Austudy payments would be required to substitute their grant for a loan. Clearly, a person from a low socio-economic background will be more averse to the incurring of substantial liabilities than somebody from a relatively wealthy background. So if we require a student to substitute a loan for the grant, I think it is wrong to say that that is unambiguously progressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gives students an option. If students want to stay with the grants scheme, they can do that. We have tried to counter the claim that this is the thin edge of the wedge by including specific provision for the regular indexation of the maximum grant in accordance with CPI. That commitment that the Government has given is embodied in this piece of legislation. We are not in the business of freezing or winding down the Austudy grants scheme. We believe that, for it to be a genuinely equitable scheme, the grants element in it has to remain central. We also believe that providing students with the option of accessing additional income support while they study through the voluntary loan arrangement embodied in the supplement is a significant improvement. It will mean that students who might otherwise have to seek part time work or who might otherwise need to withdraw from study, because in some cases they might be on less than the maximum Austudy payment, will now have an option that may make the difference between being able to progress at the maximum rate, take on a very heavy workload and focus on their studies instead of having to fossick around for part time work. I think that degree of flexibility is an unambiguous improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement is one element in a number of substantial improvements to Austudy that were announced in the Budget. We seek to bring down the age of independence from 25 to 22. Clearly, it was absurd to presume that somebody at the age of 25 was fully dependent on his or her parents. I would have liked to have corrected that anomaly earlier, but it is a quite expensive measure. The savings that have been generated by the introduction of the supplement, based on the assumption that a proportion of students will forgo their grant in order to access the supplement, have enabled us to make a number of these structural improvements in the Austudy grants scheme, including reducing the age of independence from 25 to 22 and further to liberalise the personal income test, which has already been substantially liberalised. We are adding another $1,000 to the amount that students can earn without forgoing any capacity to access Austudy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made one significant addition to the proposal set out in Dr Chapman's report by making the Austudy supplement available to a significant number of students who are ineligible for any form of Austudy. In other words, some students who do not have any grant to trade-in at all will be able to access up to $2,000 in the form of the highly concessional loan arrangement with the zero real interest rate in the income contingent repayment mechanism which cuts in only after five years. A significant number of students who are currently ineligible for any form of Austudy assistance will be able to access that financing facility. I think that enables us to provide quite worthwhile and useful assistance to a number of students who currently cannot get any assistance. I think that addition to what Dr Chapman proposed in his report represents a further significant improvement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assets test is an essential element in the scheme to ensure that it is properly targeted. Much of the concern about the Austudy scheme is related to the fact that some people with quite substantial means but relatively low taxable income are accessing the scheme, and that they really should not be if their genuine means and capacity are to be taken as the criterion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has thought very carefully about this issue. Clearly there is a degree of minimisation of taxable income through various devices, whether it be negative gearing or whether it be passing income through companies or trusts. Clearly those issues need to be under constant review. We asked Coopers and Lybrand to look at that issue and to look at practically and administratively feasible ways in which that problem could be addressed. It is not as easy as it seems on the surface. There is a range of administrative and practical problems, but we have made a first step in tightening up the definition of taxable income by seeking to include fringe benefits from calendar year 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all in all this is a key part of the Government's response to two very major surveys and reviews of the effectiveness of the student income support scheme that have been undertaken in the last couple of years. The latter, that undertaken by Dr Chapman, was explicitly sought by the Government. The net effect of these changes is that that there will be a significant increase in the grants that will be available next year. Next year we expect that the total funds available to students for income support purposes will increase by 20.7 per cent over what was available in 1991-92&mdash;an increase of almost $300m in one year in the amount of money available to students for income support while studying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a pretty good enhancement of the existing arrangement. Although, admittedly, there was some turbulence from student groups, once the students were made aware of what in specific terms the Government was proposing, I believe that the overwhelming majority of them saw these changes as being beneficial to students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In November 1991 the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority tabled its evaluation of the Authority in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. The report supported the continued existence and activities of the National Crime Authority, but raised some serious doubts as to the adequacy of the accountability mechanisms in place under the National Crime Authority Act 1984. As a response to that, legislation has now come before the House to increase the accountability mechanisms under the Act. I see the Chairman of the parliamentary Joint Committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), here. I congratulate him and his Committee on the report. The report has a lot of very good recommendations and it has led to an improvement in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions of the National Crime Authority are subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Its work is monitored by the Inter-Governmental Committee, which consists of responsible Ministers from each State and Territory and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NCA is subject to the provisions of freedom of information legislation. But, besides all of these administrative accountabilities, there still is a necessity for more accountability through the parliamentary Committee and, indeed, through the Inspector-General, which is proposed in the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to subsection 51(3) a member of the National Crime Authority or its staff cannot be required by a court to produce any document that has come into his or her custody in the course of the performance of duties under the Act, or to divulge to a court a matter that has come to his or her notice in the performance of his or her duties under the Act. There has been considerable argument about whether these provisions of section 51 apply to information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee; that is, if the parliamentary Joint Committee seeks information from an officer of the National Crime Authority, is the National Crime Authority officer obliged by section 51 not to divulge it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government apparently is of the view that such an officer would be so obliged, for in August 1990 the Chairman of the parliamentary Joint Committee received an undated letter from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) which advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is obviously a large area concerning operational matters within which NCA witnesses would be entitled, if pressed, to restrict disclosure out of regard for the prohibition in section 51.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General relied on an opinion from the Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith. The Clerk of the Senate has come to a different view&mdash;the view that it could not be otherwise than in accordance with law to provide information to a parliamentary committee and, indeed, that to provide information to a parliamentary committee would in fact be for a purpose of the Act setting up the parliamentary Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discourse between the National Crime Authority and its other supervisory mechanism, the Inter-Governmental Committee, is also restricted by the NCA Act. Subsection 59(5) prohibits the NCA from furnishing to the Inter-Governmental Committee any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operation of law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as the NCA Act currently stands, neither of the bodies charged with the responsibility of supervising the activities of the NCA has a right of unrestricted access to its information. Indeed, it was this situation that led the parliamentary Joint Committee in its report to voice strong concerns about the lack of accountability. In the light of these concerns the parliamentary Joint Committee recommended in its report that the National Crime Authority Act be amended to give the parliamentary Joint Committee unrestricted access to NCA information, but that some restrictions be placed on what in camera information that was received from the NCA could then be disclosed by the parliamentary Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a sensible recommendation. Those who are to supervise the operations of an organisation need to be able to find out information about what it is doing and about how it is operating. Without information, close supervision is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That there be a free flow of information is important to enable supervision to occur but it is also important to reassure the public that there is accountability in the National Crime Authority by assuring the public that the parliamentary Joint Committee as a representative of the Parliament and the Parliament as representative of the people of Australia have the right to obtain information from this governmental agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a second best solution&mdash;and this was put forward as a second best solution&mdash;the parliamentary Joint Committee recommended that the Act be amended to give the Joint Committee access to all information other than sensitive information. The Committee said that this category should be defined. It did not go into how sensitive information should be defined and how the second best option would work. Paragraph 7.58 said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee understands that the main concern of the Government and the IGC is over the Committee's access to information that is variously described as `sensitive' or `operational'.

<PARA>I raise this because the Bill that has been brought into the Parliament by the Government proposes to implement what the Joint Committee considered to be the second best option. The proposal to amend section 55(2) provides that the parliamentary Committee, in the performance of its duties, is entitled to request the NCA to produce to it any document held by the NCA, or to divulge or communicate any information held by the NCA, except to the extent that it is sensitive information.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that when the parliamentary Committee, in a very good report, came down in favour of higher and better accountability for the National Crime Authority, and when it looked at how that would be facilitated, it put forward two options: a best option and a second option. The Government has proposed the second best option. The Opposition has not settled and never will settle for second best options. The Opposition believes, in accordance with what was found by an all-party committee&mdash;the parliamentary Joint Committee&mdash;that this Parliament ought to implement the best option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a parliamentary committee that comprises members from the House of Representative and from the Senate, and members from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats&mdash;a rather large committee, with all complexions of view in the Parliament&mdash;comes to an agreement on something, I think the Parliament ought to take it very seriously. There would need to be some very strong reasons why we should implement something that the Committee itself concluded was the second best rather than the best option. In this instance, the Government's proposal, the second best option&mdash;that sensitive information be limited when being provided to the Committee&mdash;is not the best solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate in the Committee of the Whole House, I will move amendments to implement the best option.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will provide that the parliamentary Committee will have unrestricted access to documents and information held by the National Crime Authority. In the performance of its duty, the Committee will have the power to require the National Crime Authority to produce to it any document or communicate to it any information. Allowing the Committee full access to such information does, of course, raise the possibility, at least the theoretical possibility, that sensitive information might be disclosed. In the parliamentary Joint Committee's report, it recommended that this should be dealt with by placing restrictions on the disclosure of in camera evidence or information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report referred to a private member's Bill that had been prepared by Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats entitled the National Crime Authority (Duties and Powers of Joint Parliamentary Committee) Amendment Bill, introduced in December 1990. Senator Spindler had said that information should be unrestricted, but he had proposed in his Bill various restrictions on disclosure of that information. Senator Spindler had said that if there was going to be disclosure the Committee should notify the National Crime Authority; the National Crime Authority could certify that the information was sensitive and might prejudice the legal rights of a person; and if such a certificate were issued the information would not be disclosed; but if a dispute arose the matter would be referred to a judge of the Federal Court. That was Senator Spindler's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the parliamentary Joint Committee looked at this issue, it said that it liked Senator Spindler's proposal but it required three changes. These changes are set out on page 160 of its report:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)that the Commonwealth Minister with portfolio responsibility for the Authority should be the arbiter, not a Federal Court judge . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When the parliamentary Committee got to this, it said, `Yes, we like the idea of all information being given to the parliamentary Joint Committee. We like the idea of protecting rights by putting a certain process on what should be done if disclosure was necessary. We would like to suggest that Senator Spindler's Bill be taken as a rudimentary proposal and that it be improved in these three ways'. The funny thing is that on this point the Committee was unanimous, except for Senator Spindler, who said that he would accept it, except that he wanted to proceed with having a Federal Court judge as the person who would make the decision rather than a Commonwealth Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a parliamentary Committee which takes Senator Spindler's Bill and says that it can be improved in three ways and, with the objection of Senator Spindler in one respect, the Committee is unanimous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that on mature reflection the Government accepts these amendments. If it does not accept these amendments, I hope that Senator Spindler, who after all was the genesis&mdash;in this respect, if the Opposition was the Book of Revelation, Senator Spindler was the Book of Genesis&mdash;looks at this and realises that this is the way in which the Opposition has taken it up, and that he, uninhibited by pride and uninhibited by party discipline, which as we know ranks so strong in the Australian Labor Party, is able to exercise a mature judgment and support us in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise in passing the theoretical issue. We as a parliament can set up an organisation such as the National Crime Authority. Why? Because the Parliament exercises legislative power, it responds to the electors in elections. In a notional sense at least&mdash;although I would argue in a practical sense as well&mdash;the Parliament represents the people of Australia. We can set up the body and we can supervise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very troubling argument to put to this Parliament that, although it can set the body up and fund it, its delegated committee should not be able to have unrestricted access in its supervisory function to what this organisation does. It is almost an argument that says to the Parliament, `Don't trust yourselves. You can set it up, but don't trust yourselves to receive information from it in exercising your supervisory responsibilities'. The distinction that we draw is really the distinction between the receipt of information and the disclosure of information. We understand that, if we received sensitive information and disclosed it to the world, in certain circumstances precipitate or unwise action could damage reputations and safety. We are proposing to put in place a mechanism that would slow down the procedure and prevent precipitate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult in that wide definition to say that the Committee ought to have a restriction on what it receives&mdash;not just on what it discloses but on what it receives. It is drawn in a very wide manner, and the more I looked at it the more worried I got. Under the Government's proposal, the Committee would not be entitled to receive sensitive information. The provisions of the Bill state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Sensitive information' means any information the disclosure of which might&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Let me give honourable members an example. Suppose the Committee sought information on the conduct in an official capacity of the NCA Chairman and the NCA says, `Oh, that's the information the disclosure of which might prejudice the reputation of a person, namely the NCA Chairman'. That would be an open construction; it is drafted very widely. This is no theoretical matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting for a moment that the Committee would or should be interested in matters of notoriety or matters that relate to the private affairs of people, but it may well be that in the course of one's deliberations one thinks that the Chairman&mdash;and I am not suggesting this applies to anybody, real or imagined&mdash;has acted in a particular way that is not in the best interests of the National Crime Authority. Maybe it is an administrative matter. It may be that one thinks the Chairman has not promoted on merit or has implemented a system of nepotism within the National Crime Authority. Let us say that someone requests information and the NCA says, `Oh, that's information the disclosure of which might prejudice the reputation of a person, namely the Chairman'. That seems to me to be an open argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind, of course, that the person requesting the information is coming from the dark, and when the NCA is taking the defence that person does not even know what the information is. In that circumstance, one would say, `Oh well, the matter can be referred to the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the Commonwealth Attorney will intervene'. That would presumably be the argument. But, as we all know, Ministers tend to be creatures of their department, some more than others. It is a very rare Minister who overrules an agency or a department. I would much prefer to have the committee in a position where it could access the information prima facie and, indeed, require the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) is a noted civil libertarian. He must have great difficulty with the situation that the Attorney has fronted him with on this particular Bill. He is in a situation where, if he rejects these amendments, he has to say, `Well, we think the Parliamentary Committee should be restricted in receiving information'. He, of course, likes to think of himself as one of the enfants terrible of the administration of law and justice in the 1980s, a man of great civil libertarian principles and tendencies. Internally he must be a mass of convulsions and contradictions over this particular piece of legislation. But in his heart he knows we are right on this. He knows that the Parliamentary Committee should be given that particular access to information. I will describe in more detail when we come to the committee stage how our amendment would work, but that gives an overview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come now to the question of the establishment of the office of the Inspector-General. The Opposition welcomes the Government's proposal to amend the NCA Act to establish the new office of Inspector-General as another positive step towards ensuring that the NCA is properly accountable for its actions. Clause 10 of the Bill will insert a new part IIIA into the Act to make provision for the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. The Inspector-General's principal function will be to investigate complaints lodged by the public about the actions of members or staff of the National Crime Authority. Division 2 will provide for the receipt and investigation of individual complaints by the Inspector-General. The Inspector-General will be obliged to investigate all complaints, except those which he comes to the conclusion are frivolous or vexatious and, having regard to all the circumstances, do not warrant an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 will deal with the conduct of the inquiries. The Inspector-General will be required to inform the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the chairperson of the NCA before commencing an investigation. His inquiries will be conducted in private and will not be subject to formal procedural requirements. The Inspector-General will be entitled to compel the production of information and documents and to make such use of the information as may be needed for the purposes of the investigation. He will be entitled to compel people to attend before him and give evidence on oath or affirmation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person will be entitled to refuse to give information or answer a question if there is a reasonable excuse for doing so. `Reasonable excuse' is not defined in the Bill. However, on examining the Bill it seems that the reasonable excuse exception would, subject to subclause 55AR(1)(e), authorise a person to refuse to give information, produce a document or answer a question on the ground that to do so would involve a breach of legal professional privilege. I am raising here the point as to whether it would be a reasonable excuse to disclose a document or information on the grounds that that would be a breach of legal professional privilege. We would like to keep that, and we have come to the conclusion that the Act preserves legal professional privilege. If the Government has come to a different conclusion, it had better state it now because we will try to amend the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a well understood rule of statutory construction that a statute is not read as abrogating important common law rights, including legal professional privilege, save to the extent directed by express words or necessary implication. Apart from 55AR(1)(e), which expressly abrogates legal professional privilege in respect of legal advice given to a Minister, a department or authority of the Commonwealth, there are no provisions in the Bill which evince an intention to abrogate legal professional privilege in regard to the Inspector-General's powers under clauses 55AN and 55AO. On the contrary, the fact that the draftsmen considered it necessary to include subclause 55AR(1)(e) in the Bill implies that a claim for legal professional privilege falls within the reasonable excuse exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person will not be excused from furnishing information, producing a document or answering a question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate. However, such information, document or answer will not be admissible in any criminal proceedings. The Opposition considers this restriction too narrow. It would not, for example, prevent the answer from being used against a person in civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the equivalent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act that applies to the intelligence agencies, the restriction on the use of an incriminating answer compulsorily obtained by the Inspector-General is broader. It cannot be used in evidence against the person in any court, or in any proceedings before a person authorised to hear evidence. That would give immunity from the use of the answer in disciplinary proceedings. </PARA>

Despite the honourable member's use of the words from page 160 of the report that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority regarded the first option as the preferred option and it regarded the second option as the second best, he is being somewhat mischievous in his proposed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the rhetorical question as to what he would do if he were the Attorney-General: would he be standing in this House moving the kinds of amendments that he proposes to move in the committee stage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important piece of legislation. I am very pleased that, in general, the Opposition is supporting these amendments. The Bill introduces a number of important amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The amendments are apparently developed from the Government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. Although I do not intend to speak on each amendment, I would like to make some remarks on a few issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I refer to the establishment of the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. His task will be to investigate complaints against the Authority or its staff. I pay tribute to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for his assistance in the development of this concept through the Joint Committee. Obviously, his experience in the House and as a Minister in a previous government stood the Committee well in developing this concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Committee's evaluation of the National Crime Authority, a number of witnesses suggested that, in addition to the parliamentary Joint Committee, other bodies could be given the role of investigating complaints against the Authority or its staff. For example, it was suggested that appropriate bodies could include the Commonwealth Ombudsman, a police complaints authority, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, or a body similar to that which exists in the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland. Other mechanisms were also suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present complaints against the Authority are investigated and dealt with in a variety of ways. For example, the parliamentary Joint Committee, the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Attorney-General and the Authority itself play a role in this regard. Section 50 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General may appoint a legal practitioner to assist the Authority as counsel, either generally or in relation to a particular matter or matters.</PARA>
<PARA>In July 1989, the Authority issued a press statement headed `NCA Drug Inquiry'. That was an inquiry into an alleged impropriety of Authority staff. The counsel conducting the inquiry was assisted by an Australian Federal Police officer and a Victoria Police officer, both of whom were attached to the Authority. I might add for the record that the investigation team found no evidence of impropriety by Authority staff on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that at present there is a wide variety of ways in which complaints are being dealt with; hence the need for this legislation. Although few complaints against the Authority or its staff have been brought to the attention of the parliamentary Joint Committee for investigation, the fact is that the parliamentary Joint Committee does not have the time or resources to deal adequately with individual complaints. The previous Chairman of the Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, favoured a system of inquiry outside the Authority for handling serious complaints. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, the Parliamentary Joint Committee recommended that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority,  its staff and those seconded to work for it. Furthermore, the Committee took the view that, if it were necessary to set up a new agency, it should be adequately resourced and that the procedures in dealing with complaints should be simple and able to be proceeded with expeditiously. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has decided to adopt that recommendation and establish this new office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. In practice, that responsibility will be carried out by the occupant of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will not have the broad monitoring function which he has in his other capacity in relation to intelligence and security agencies, the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will investigate complaints against members or staff of the National Crime Authority but will not be entitled to initiate an investigation on his own motion, in accordance with proposed section 55AE(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general monitoring of the work of the Authority will remain the responsibility of the parliamentary Joint Committee and also the Commonwealth-State Intergovernmental Committee. Moreover, the Inspector-General will investigate complaints only where they cannot be dealt with satisfactorily under complaints legislation or procedures applicable to a police force from which the possible subject of the complaint has been seconded to the Authority; that is to say, that where there are other mechanisms available, for example, dealing with complaints against police who have been seconded to the Authority, such officers should generally remain subject to the appropriate procedures in relation to their home forces. Indeed, I envisage there would be substantial difficulty, jurisdictional and practical, in setting in place a complaints procedure in relation to NCA staff which included seconded police, where such persons are subject to their home force complaints arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's intention is that the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority should operate as a highly visible complaints authority, able to handle matters which cannot be dealt with by other means. I think it is also important that the Inspector-General should be seen in a highly visible way so people do have knowledge that there is an Inspector-General of the Authority to deal with complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue, of course, is that the primary function of the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will be to investigate complaints about actions of members of the Authority and its staff. In this regard he is to report on the investigations he conducts to the chairperson or chairman of the National Crime Authority and to the Minister administering the National Crime Authority Act, in this case the Attorney-General. I am pleased to note that under section 55AZH it is proposed that the Inspector-General will report to the Minister on the operations of the Inspector-General&mdash;that is, his office&mdash;during the year ended 30 June each year and that, in addition, the Minister must table a copy of each report in each House of the Parliament as soon as practicable after the report is received by the Minister. I am also pleased to note that one of the functions of the parliamentary Joint Committee in these amendments will be to examine each annual report of the Inspector-General and report to both Houses of the Parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be said during this debate that the Inspector-General will be able to investigate complaints made to him either orally or in writing by the public, whether made directly to him or through the Intergovernmental Committee or the PJC. Although he has power to require people to adduce their complaints in writing, if he is to proceed with them, the fact is that the Inspector-General will retain a wide discretion to assess whether complaints can be dealt with satisfactorily under alternative procedures, for example, Commonwealth or State legislation, and he also has a wide discretion to assess whether complaints warrant investigation by him&mdash;in other words, that they are not frivolous, vexatious or trivial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to other innovative changes contained in these amendments, namely, the establishment of a review process in relation to the provision of sensitive information to the PJC. The honourable member for Higgins has spoken at length on clause 9 of the Bill. Indeed, as he said, he proposes to put forward amendments. Let me say what clause 9 does. It repeals existing section 55(2), which prohibits the parliamentary Joint Committee from investigating a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity, a term which is defined in the principal Act, or of reconsidering the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 55(2) was considered at length in the parliamentary Joint Committee's evaluation report. Indeed, the previous Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, stated that there was `an arguable case' for the removal of the words under section 55(2)(a) `a matter relating to', which would have the effect of removing inappropriate limitations on the parliamentary Joint Committee. I should add that a distinguished Victorian barrister, Mr Merkel, QC, through the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties and its appearance before the parliamentary Joint Committee, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 55(2) should be repealed. We say that is the mischief that has been caused to the system and we say that, if accountability is to exist at all, it is imperative that the limitations on the power of the Committee to fulfil its functions be lifted. We say that all the niceties of how this should be done are very easily resolved: you repeal section 55(2). . . </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Committee rejected the advice from the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, the Committee recognised that there had to be some limitations placed with respect to information held by the National Crime Authority. I believe that the new subsection (2) provides a suitable framework for the parliamentary Joint Committee to obtain information sufficient to enable the parliamentary Joint Committee to reasonably perform its statutory responsibilities. The new subsection (2) sets out the procedure by which information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee can be obtained and also includes an important role for the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority to advise the Minister, when requested by him, as to whether or not documents or information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee contains sensitive information, which is defined in section 3 of the Bill, as to whether it should reasonably be withheld from the parliamentary Joint Committee. Ultimately, of course, it is for the Minister to decide as to the release of such material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the honourable member for Higgins to behave, I would respectfully suggest to him, quite mischievously in promoting the first alternative. He knows full well that there would be serious objections from his colleagues in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory as to the adoption of the amendments proposed by him. Although the Committee as a whole did prefer another option, the practical situation and, as we said, the second best solution&mdash;I wish we had never used those words&mdash;is that we proceed down the path as set out in the Bill. For that reason I am constrained and I support wholeheartedly the amendments contained in clause 9 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Attorney-General and officers of the Attorney-General's Department on the diligence and speed with which they have developed amendments in accordance with the Government's response to the evaluation report of the parliamentary Joint Committee. I congratulate them. I believe that the amendments are sensibly drafted, they are practical, they will be accepted by the members of the Intergovernmental Committee and I believe that they will work in practice. As the Minister said in his second reading speech when introducing the Bill, the National Crime Authority Act 1984 will require refinement from time to time, and if we do meet hurdles in applying the provisions of these amendments or any other section of the Act then of course we would expect the Government to respond by either removing or adding to the Act to ensure that the work of the parliamentary Joint Committee proceeds in a way which meets the expectations of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wholeheartedly support the Bill. I again would like to record my gratitude to members of the National Crime Authority parliamentary Joint Committee for the way in which they contributed to the development of these processes.

I acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by him in this area and in the evaluation report, which is a very important document. I think the Committee excelled in providing the Parliament with a very substantial overview and review of the operations of the National Crime Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill, to which I have already alluded, is to establish the office of Inspector-General of the NCA to provide for inquiries into complaints against the National Crime Authority and to clarify which information from the Authority the parliamentary Joint Committee can have access to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly go over the history of the Authority because I think it is important in this context. The Authority was established in 1984. We recall back in those days the royal commissions into organised crime, the various recommendations that came forward from those royal commissions, the long debates over how the National Crime Authority should evolve or should be formed and the question of the accountability of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the Authority was to conduct investigations into organised crime. The Authority came into being by agreement between the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers. The Inter-Governmental Committee, which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers, was set up to oversee the general operation of the NCA. At the same time, as a result of the debates in the Parliament, the Parliamentary Joint Committee was also set up to provide a parliamentary oversight of the operations of the NCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Crime Authority undertakes two types of investigations: special investigations and general investigations. The special investigations are based on referrals from the Commonwealth, State or Territory Ministers in consultation with the Inter-Governmental Committee. In empowering the NCA to conduct these inquiries, the Parliament gave the NCA some substantial coercive powers&mdash;in particular, the power to force people to appear before the Authority to give evidence and to produce documents. These are powers that are far in excess of the traditional police powers that have been in existence in the Commonwealth, States and Territories before the setting up of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the establishment of the NCA in June 1991, there have been 12 references for special inquiries and these have ranged through tax evasion, importation and distribution of narcotics, bribery, corruption and murder. As I mentioned, the special investigations usually involve more than one category of offences. The general investigations are initiated by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty has always been in the question of accountability of performance&mdash;the difficulty of assessing how the Authority is performing its duties because of the nature of its inquiries and the need for some confidentiality or secrecy of aspects of the Authority's inquiries. The other aspect is that, because of the comparative lack of data on the spread of organised crime within Australia, it is very difficult to compare the statistical results of the NCA vis-a-vis the organised criminal activity undertaken in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accountability, as I have mentioned, is jointly undertaken by the Inter-Governmental Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The latter body has, over a number of years, been critical of its lack of access to documents and evidence that would make its work more effective. I would like to turn to the report and read how the Authority, in its submission, viewed the NCA's accountability. In particular, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCA's work is monitored both by the Inter-Governmental Committee and, of course, by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA, established by the Commonwealth Parliament expressly for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>In the evaluation undertaken by the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee a number of recommendations were made, in particular recommendation No. 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important recommendation which attempts to deal with the problems where there are individual complaints against the Authority and its staff, which neither the PJC nor the IGC are in a position to investigate, and also in areas where clearly the opportunity to retain the confidentiality of secrecy must be preserved. That recommendation was an important one. I again commend the right honourable member for New England for his tremendous contribution towards that end. Recommendation No. 5 deals with the changes to section 55(2)(a) and 55(2)(b) of the NCA Act. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) that paragraph 55(2)(a) of the NCA Act be amended by deleting the words `a matter relating to';</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) that paragraph 55(2)(b) be amended to make it clear that the expression `findings' refers only to major matters formally declared by the Authority to be findings at the time they are made, and does not include all conclusions reached by the Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) that paragraph 55(2)(b) be amended to make clear that it does not prevent the Committee reviewing alleged maladministration within the Authority or the general adequacy of procedures used by the Authority, even if the end result of the Authority's use of the procedures is the making of a `finding' in particular cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that section 51 of the NCA Act be amended so as to make clear that section 51 does not prevent members and staff of the Authority providing any information or documents to the Committee, or appearing before it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is probably the most important recommendation of our recommendations from the evaluation report. Recommendation No. 8, which is an important recommendation, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the NCA Act be amended so as to confer a discretion on an Authority member to hold investigative hearings in public.</PARA>
<PARA>These recommendations are all designed effectively to make the NCA more accountable and to provide the PJC with the opportunity to ensure that that comes to pass. I want to turn to the question of accountability and, in particular, to refer to the comments made by the honourable member for Herbert in relation to the so-called second best option. I think it is important that we refer again to recommendation No. 6. The Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that section 51 of the NCA Act be amended so as to make clear that section 51 does not prevent members and staff of the Authority providing any information or documents to the Committee, or appearing before it.</PARA>
<PARA>In endeavouring to provide the Committee with the first best option, the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) attempt to do so in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Clause 9, page 4, line 23, omit "request", substitute "require".</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the opportunity for members of the Committee to be able to fulfil their duties properly and to be able to pursue the inquiries that they consider are necessary to ensure that the Authority is properly overseen by the Committee would take away that option of the Chairman to be able to refuse the request of a Committee member. To that extent, I support and concur with that particular amendment proposed by the honourable member for Higgins. The second amendment proposed by the honourable member for Higgins states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9, page 4, line 27, omit "except to the extent that it contains, or is, sensitive information", substitute "and the Chairperson must comply with the requirement".</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this relates back to that question of the second best option. Bearing in mind the recommendation that was made by the Committee, that in order to fulfil the duties imposed on members of the Committee it is important that information that is necessary to the best picture or the fulfilment of a particular inquiry must be available to those members. We are trying to allow the Committee members the opportunity of having access to all information in order for them to fulfil their particular duty. Amendment (3) of the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Higgins states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9, pages 4 and 5, omit proposed subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6), substitute the following subsections:</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to go through the procedure that is proposed in the amendments. Subsection (3) would read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Committee, or a member of the Committee, considers that it is necessary, in a report to the Parliament or otherwise, to disclose:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)oral evidence taken by the Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in camera</EMPHASIS>, from persons who, at the time they gave evidence, were officers of the Authority or to provide a report of such oral evidence; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)a document which has been submitted to the Committee by an officer of the Authority and which has been requested by the officer of the Authority or ordered by the Committee to be treated as evidence taken <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in camera</EMPHASIS>,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Committee or the member of the Committee, as the case may be, must inform the Chairperson in writing of the evidence or the document proposed to be disclosed or provided.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that speaks for itself as being an eminently reasonable way of ensuring that the process can be started in order for that evidence or documentation from the Authority to be able to be disclosed, if it is considered to be necessary in properly informing the Parliament of the performance of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairperson may, within 14 days after a proposal under subsection (3) has been provided to the Chairperson, certify, by writing signed by the Chairperson and provided to the Committee, that the evidence or the document to which the proposal relates contains, or is, sensitive information.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairperson, within 14 days after a proposal under subsection (3) has been provided to the Chairperson, is then given the opportunity of certifying by writing, this certification to be provided to the Committee, that the evidence or the document to which the proposal relates contains, or is, sensitive information. This clearly then allows the Chairperson of the Committee the opportunity</PARA>
<PARA>to be able to assess the sensitivity or otherwise of that particular information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment (5) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a certificate has been so provided by the Chairperson the Committee or a member of the Committee must not, in a report to the Parliament or otherwise, except in accordance with subsection (10) or (12), disclose any evidence or document which is the subject of that certificate.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Chairman of the Committee has given that opportunity to assess the sensitivity or otherwise of the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the process moves on to allow the following under amendment (10):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister determines under subsection (7) that the evidence or document does not contain, or is not, sensitive information, that evidence or document may be disclosed by the Committee in a report to the Parliament by the Committee or in a special report to the Parliament by a member of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to reflect that, in determining what is appropriate to be revealed to the Parliament or otherwise, it is clearly important that the confidential operations or investigations of the Authority are not disclosed in order to render that inquiry or investigation less effective or to reveal information that may otherwise compromise people who are involved in that investigation or who are the subject of that investigation. Clearly there is a need for the Parliament to be able to be informed of areas where there are matters of doubt or concern to members of the Committee who in those circumstances wish to inform the Parliament of those concerns and at the same time be able to use information that they believe is pertinent to that notification to the Parliament in their speech to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment (11) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A special report by a member of the Committee under subsection (10) may be attached to a report by the Committee or may be presented to each House of the Parliament in the absence of a report by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that amendment 11 covers the concerns that have been registered quite a few times in the Parliament in relation to information that was revealed in a minority report to the Parliament on the Operation Ark matter. That matter became a matter of some controversy at the time because it is alleged by Government members on the Committee that, in so presenting that minority report to parliament, the signatories to that report, which included myself, were, I suppose, making the relationship between the Authority and the PJC untenable. I think that my recollection at the time was that the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) made an allegation that the relationship between the Committee and the Chairman had been somehow damaged. Following his speech to the House, he came back and made a personal explanation to inform the House that the Chairman of the Authority had contacted him to say that that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in providing the processes for the opportunity of members to be able to have access to sensitive information, and for members to be in a position to report fully to the Parliament in relation to either minority or full reports or reports that they initiate themselves, I believe that the amendments that will be moved by the honourable member for Higgins are preferable to those that are part of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill. I commend those amendments which are in the name of the honourable member for Higgins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to make a number of points. They relate overall to the National Crime Authority's special powers and the opportunity for proper oversight of the operations of the Authority. It has been mentioned that the IGC is supposed to provide that oversight for the National Crime Authority. I want to turn again to the points raised by the Committee in the evaluation report as to the effectiveness of that oversight by the IGC in the history of the NCA to the present. The Committee in its report said at 6.33:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that IGC should have paid greater regard to the need to maintain public confidence in the Authority, and to make public more of the material the IGC receives from the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>It also made some criticisms of the lack of frequency of the meetings of the IGC. I see the Chairman nodding in agreement, because that was an important element in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the NCA and also to this question of accountability. The Committee said in paragraph 6.29 that the claim by the IGC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that itself provides a better line of responsibility to ensure both the protection of civil liberties and the effective oversight of the operational and functional activities of the NCA . . . is difficult to reconcile with the limited activities of the IGC. In the period July 1984 to October 1991, the IGC met on only 16 occasions. This suggests to the Committee that the IGC has taken only a very limited role in monitoring the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>In concluding, I must say that if one is to accept the principle that accountability is in the hands of the IGC on the one hand and the PJC on the other, and I suppose having seen the level of oversight provided by the IGC, then there is greater pressure on the parliamentary Joint Committee to provide that oversight. I am sure that the Chairman would agree with that. Since the formation of the NCA and the establishment of the PJC, the question of access of Committee members to information and of their being able to speak to members or staff of the Authority has been a matter for continual criticism. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2), flows directly out of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, prepared by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and published in November 1991. The question posed in the title of the report is invariably a difficult one to confront in respect of any law enforcement body, and is timely, given the concerns raised about the performance of, and alleged corruption in, some such bodies in Australia over the last decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the National Crime Authority itself, there has been, of course, an ongoing debate for some time now about its effectiveness, including its prosecution and conviction record. It is to be hoped that the proposed new office of Inspector-General of the NCA will sharpen the organisation's performance and, in that sense, it is a desirable initiative. However, it must be said that many major matters of alleged official corruption remain unattended in this country, which the NCA is empowered to look at if an appropriate reference is given. I wish to raise two such matters today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prominent among the many scandals of Labor's 10 years maladministration in Victoria was the infamous Continental Airlines affair, in which a significant number of well-known Victorians and other figures were found to have received discounted or free tickets from the airline. The proof of evidence provided by the late Mr Bob Tanfield, former sales manager for Victoria-Tasmania with Continental Airlines in the early 1980s, in respect of his committal for trial on fraud, listed 24 senior Victoria Police officers, public servants and others, who benefited by way of free or discounted tickets for themselves and/or their family members or friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They included the then Assistant Commissioner, Paul Delianis, who accepted a waiver or free ticket for his wife, Thelma; the then Deputy Commissioner, Eric Mudge, who took two 75 per cent discount tickets to Auckland; the then Assistant Commissioner, Richard Knight, who got two tickets; the then Chief Inspector, Brian Harding, who took two tickets; Senior Sergeant Ron Elliott, who had two tickets; and the then Commander, Phil Bennett, who was given two tickets to Nandi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the then Deputy Commissioner, Eric Nudge, who resigned, essentially over the Continental Airlines affair, no other police officers or public servants involved had any significant official action, that is known to me, taken against them, though, no doubt, a number were privately cautioned about their actions. This is intriguing, as the Continental Airlines affair was a serious matter and obviously regarded as such in some quarters at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 November 1985, the then Assistant Commissioner for Internal Investigations in the Victoria Police, Mr William J. Horman, wrote to Mr Robert Redlich, QC, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re: Ticket inquiry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday, 21 November, 1985, a meeting took place at Parliament House, Melbourne, involving Minister for Police &amp; Emergency Services, Hon. R.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was appropriate that the matter be regarded as grave. Mr Tanfield clearly knew the illicit nature of the arrangements he was putting in place, in which he was initially aided by his friend, the then Chief Superintendent, Bob Stewart, of the Police Research and Development Branch, who was himself another beneficiary of the arrangements. In stating what he had done, Tanfield's proof of evidence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was aware that it was not in accordance with the IATA rules, so I had to be fairly careful who I let on . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Expanding on his use of tickets really only designed for airline staff, Tanfield added:</PARA>

<PARA>Though the transgressions of senior Victoria Police officers in the Continental Airlines affair evinced no direct official action against those involved, they parallel other strange events of that time which are also worthy of investigation by the National Crime Authority. I refer, of course, to the odd outcome of the investigation that followed the crucial Nunawading province by-election on 17 August 1985, which was a fresh election ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns after the infamous `draw from the hat' result of 2 March that year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final police report was completed by Detective Inspector R.H.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this day voters receiving this card have told police they were misled or deceived, believing the card to be the official NDP card. Police have also been told by some NDP helpers (handing out official NDP cards) that they were approached by persons, shown the Nuclear Disarmament card, and either informed that policy had been changed, or that they were being relieved and they should go to some other particular booth. Police have also been told that on the official NDP helper leaving one booth the official NDP card was placed in the rubbish bin and the Nuclear Disarmament card distributed in its place.</PARA>
<PARA>A great number of people were interviewed by the Victoria Police during the course of the inquiry, including members of the NDP, the Australian Democrats, the Liberal Party, the ALP and those most directly involved, plus voters who were misled. The report commented in detail on the distinct lack of cooperation with the investigation of some people, particularly Mrs Kay Setches, former MLA for Ringwood. The report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">67. I believe there has been an agreement by Nikolaidou, Batchelor and other unknown persons to devise a scheme in an attempt to induce voters to allocate their preference votes in a manner which would give an advantage to the ALP in the election, the result of which was expected to be a close contest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">68. I do not fully accept the account put forward by Batchelor in his release, and the facts put forward in later interviews on television programs with him. It appears he was more prepared to talk to the press than the police, and I believe it was an attempt to hamper and restrict any further police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">69.

Inspector Russell then formally recommended in his report that Mr Nick Nikolaidou, Mr Peter Batchelor and Mr Michael Salvaris be charged with common law conspiracy in defrauding voters or conspiracy in deceiving voters under the Crimes Act section 321(1). Additionally, Inspector Russell recommended that Mr Nick Nikolaidou be charged with authorising material likely to mislead or deceive an elector under section 267B(1) of the Constitution Act Amendment Act. Moreover, the recommendation was made that the following persons be charged under section 267B(1) with distributing material likely to mislead or deceive an elector, namely, Mr Peter Batchelor, Mr Michael Salvaris, Mr Ronald James Carli, Mr Stefano Di Pieri, Mr Paul Slape, Mr Ian Baker, Mr Hand Van Leeuwen, Mr Ian Maxwell, Mr Peter McDonald and Mr William Cooper. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr John Coldrey QC, recommended that prosecutions be laid against several persons allegedly involved in the publication and distribution of the fake how-to-vote card. This advice was then sent along with the police report by the Chief Commissioner to the Chief Electoral Officer on 19 March 1986. Next day, the Chief Electoral Officer informed the Director-General of Property and Services by memo of these events. On 21 March the Chief Electoral Officer requested the Crown Solicitor to seek the advice of the Solicitor-General, Mr Hartog Berkeley, and junior counsel, Mr Gerard Nash. It was later disclosed, during an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act in early 1987 before Judge Rowlands of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that the Director-General of Property and Services, Dr G.W.

<PARA>On 2 April 1986 the Solicitor-General and Mr Nash recommended that no prosecutions be initiated. Further convoluted administrative and legal manoeuvres took place, all of which resulted with the Chief Electoral Officer, on 8 May 1986, deciding not to press charges.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, in the Nunawading by-election cover-up, despite the recommendation by the actual investigating Victoria Police officers that charges be laid&mdash;a recommendation agreed with by Mr Habersberger, Mr Grace and Mr Coldrey&mdash;did nothing happen? Was there any connection between these almost simultaneous and peculiar sets of circumstances?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I only want to respond very briefly. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), raised the issue of whether or not the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 excludes legal professional privilege from being a reasonable excuse for not answering questions and providing information to the Inspector-General under clause 55AQ of the Bill. He gave as his opinion, I think that is a fair word to use, that he believed that legal professional privilege was protected.

<PARA>The rationale for the amendments has been put by me in the second reading debate. The rationale is that the parliamentary Joint Committee ought to have access to information but there should be some restrictions, or at least a procedure, on how that information is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) went through the amendments in quite some detail in his speech. Essentially what is provided is that if there is sensitive information and a committee or a member considers it necessary to report on that matter, the Chairman or Chairperson of the National Crime Authority must be informed. The Chairperson can certify that the evidence or proposed disclosure is sensitive and if that is so certified, it cannot be disclosed except subject to various appeal mechanisms which I will go on to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in our amendments then go on to provide that if there is an argument between the Chairman of the National Crime Authority and the Committee or a member of the Committee, the matter can be referred to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General can either make the decision himself or direct that the Inspector-General make the decision. If the Attorney-General is of the view that the information is not sensitive and it would not be against the public interest for disclosure, that can be done. However, if the Minister effectively upholds the position of the NCA then that restriction on disclosing the sensitive information must hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I explained in my speech in the second reading debate, the genesis of that proposal came from Senator Spindler's Bill. With the improvement suggested by the parliamentary Joint Committee, we think it adequately protects both the position of the Committee in getting information and the position of those who might be injured or damaged, or investigations that might be injured or damaged, if there were precipitate disclosure. There is a long and fair procedure to lead to arbitration, and in those circumstances I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the Opposition. Whilst the Committee did describe what is proposed in the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) as the second best option, as has been said, it still described it as `but still an acceptable solution'. I think the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is being a bit disingenuous in moving this. He knows quite well the framework in which the National Crime Authority operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Crime Authority does not only operate under legislation of this Parliament; it also operates under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the various States and Territories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the level of industrial disputes in Australia?

Finally, is he expecting a wage break-out that would prejudice the Government's achievements in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noticed in the release by the Statistician on 12 October this year that in the 12 months ending June 1992 a total of 906 disputes were reported in progress. This figure is the lowest recorded since the series commenced in 1981. It indicates, I think, that the annual average rate of 229 working days lost per 1,000 employees over the life of the accord is 61 per cent lower than the figure of 590 working days lost per 1,000 employees under the previous Fraser Liberal-National Party Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table for the information of honourable members a publication of the Department of Industrial Relations entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace Bargaining: The First 100 Agreements.</EMPHASIS> You will see in that document all the flexibility that the Opposition now desires to have in the wage system. But, of course, it does not have flexibility down by cutting remuneration packages. The level of disputation in the context of the accord and the social wage of which it is part would, of course, fall away with the imposition of a 15 per cent consumption tax. That would adversely affect current wage outcomes and the application of existing industrial relations policies. Today there was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a paper, which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> secured under freedom of information legislation, of a Treasury minute on the macro implications of a change in the tax mix, which was produced by the Treasury, signed off by Mr Fraser, Deputy Secretary, on 6 May 1992. In that paper, which was requested by the Treasurer, the Treasurer asked that the Treasury repeat its modelling work allowing for the possibility of the introduction of a goods and services tax leading to wage flow-ons. Those flow-ons indicate that in the short to medium term&mdash;I quote from the notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are less favourable effects to the economy compared with those reported in the earlier minute. The effects on domestic activity and GDP are much more negative, especially around years four to seven where activity is significantly reduced in the face of the wage-price spiral. GDP bottoms around 4 percentage points below control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, below what it would otherwise be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">around this time with domestic demand around 7 percentage points below control. Inflation and wages are much higher with prices peaking around 12 percentage points above control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 12 percentage points above what they would otherwise be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and unemployment deteriorates in line with weaker GDP peaking around two percentage points above control, above what it would otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a great similarity between this publication and these results and what I quoted from yesterday in the Murphy model, which was done by the Opposition's own modeller on its policies. The two charts show that for CPI Dr Murphy has 10 per cent and the Treasury has 12; for real GDP Murphy has minus 4 and the Treasury has minus 4; and for the rise in unemployment from a flow-on Dr Murphy has plus 2.1 per cent and the Treasury has 2 per cent. It is remarkable, is it not, that they are the same. Barring the inflation forecast where Murphy has 10 and the Treasury has 12, in terms of lost GDP of 4 per cent and higher unemployment of 2 per cent they are the same. It is funny about that, is it not? The reason the Treasurer did not make this information available himself was that he was waiting to see whether the Opposition's industrial relations policy, if announced, would allow for a national wage deduction.</PARA>

It reveals that GDP will fall by 4 per cent by the sixth year; the CPI will be up by 12 per cent by the fifth year; employment will be down by 3 per cent; and unemployment will be up by a massive 172,000. Let me remind the honourable member for Flinders that this is his model and his policy. It is just being modelled on the basis of an assumption which most professional economists believe is a more likely prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point, as the Prime Minister has said, is that the crucial assumption here&mdash;and the only different assumption between the earlier work and the later work&mdash;was the assumption about whether the cost and price pressures implicit in the introduction of the GST would flow into wages. What the Opposition now has to show is what policy devices it would have to prevent that occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had the honourable member for Bennelong saying that under the Opposition's decentralised wages system there would be no mechanism for a discount. Therefore, how can the old mechanical megaphone there, the honourable member for Flinders, say that there will be no feeding through of price increases into the wages system? Where is the mechanism? Where are the wage policy policemen to prevent that occurrence? One way of putting it is that the Treasury may well have taken at face value what the honourable member for Bennelong said last week&mdash;that is, `We have no wages policy that can prevent price increases getting into wages'. This is not a question of what the Treasury thinks on this matter. This is a matter of the effect of the Opposition's wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Flinders is going off to get his further instructions to work out what to say next. So fleet of foot is he, so quick on his feet, that he knows what to say next&mdash;off he goes to get his further instructions. I thought you had Fightback committed to memory. This modelling exercise is about the Opposition's policy and the pressure that its policy would put on the wages system&mdash;that is, the inflationary impact of the price rise coming through from the wages policy. This is the Opposition's model, modelling its policy, with all the pressures inherent in it. It is his music and he has to dance to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House of recent developments in enterprise bargaining? Are these developments consistent with the Government's strategy for improving industrial relations in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2116" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Reid, I can say that there have been very considerable developments in enterprise bargaining in recent times. We now have something like 367 registered enterprise bargains in the federal jurisdiction and, of course, many others which are unregistered or which are registered under the State jurisdictions. Of those 367 federally registered agreements, we do not have information about the number of employees under about a quarter of them, but for those on which we do have information, there are about 250,000 employees who are covered by them&mdash;that is about 12 1/2 per cent of the number of employees covered by federal awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These numbers are starting to become quite substantial. We would expect those numbers to increase considerably in future months as more and more agreements are completed. A most important feature of many of these agreements is that they are changing award conditions to suit the needs of the enterprise. We see this with quite a number of such agreements. I will refer to a few. At the ANZ Bank, for instance, where there are no restrictions put on the hours of work of full time employees provided they are not below 152 hours every four weeks, arrangements are negotiated to suit the worker and the branch manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Stafford Ellinson, which is a clothing factory in Bendigo, Victoria, the agreement provides for flexibility to organise working hours and involves banking of hours to enable management to have employees working up to 12 hours on a single shift without paying overtime, excess hours above the standard 38 hours accumulated, and workers can apply to take the time off when they want it, or management can give at least 24 hours notice for the time off to be taken. That is real flexibility in the working week and is very much what members of the Opposition say they are trying to achieve, but it is being achieved under the present industrial relations policy enterprise bargaining approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to penalty rates at the firm of Kimberley-Clark in South Australia, there is agreement for annual salaries which incorporate an element that compensates for overtime and shift premiums so that workers can take 12-hour shifts&mdash;two days on, two nights on and then four days off. They can be called back into work if they are required without additional cost to the company because the penalty rate is included in the overall rate. That is not unique at all to the Kimberley-Clark company; it is in a number of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Coles supermarkets there is a major enterprise bargain covering some 35,000 employees. Whilst there is maintenance of the 38-hour week, there is greater flexibility in the hours worked within a four week cycle, greater flexibility in rostering arrangements and reduction in penalty rates for those working night shifts in 24-hour continuous trading shops from 200 per cent to 130 per cent, which has made 24-hour shopping a real possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that there are these very considerable changes taking place to award conditions to suit the enterprise in these really basic conditions of employment. This is happening without any exploitation of the work force because these agreements do have to meet the requirement of the Act as it has now been amended, which means that the Industrial Relations Commission cannot reject agreements unless it believes that there would be disadvantage to employees. That is a fundamental protection against exploitation, whilst allowing real flexibility in the conditions of employment to suit the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would have no such provision to prevent exploitation. It supposedly provides a minimum hourly wage and a minimum stipulation relating to annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave, according to what the Opposition spokesman had to say a week ago. He does not say what these levels would be or how he would impose them. But otherwise, apart from these minima, whatever they are, there would be no protection for people who are forced out of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make no mistake that under the Opposition's policy people will be forced out of awards because people who are in positions where they have no real bargaining power, where unions are weak or non-existent, will be told by employers, `If you want to work here, then you are going to have to work here under conditions which we set'. The condition is that there is an enterprise agreement. The employer will say, `The enterprise agreement sets conditions which I say should apply'. They can be less than current award rates, except for these minima, whatever they are, that the honourable member for Bennelong in his generosity would set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that this is a recipe for gross exploitation of sections of the work force. If that is not the case, then why abolish this section of the law which currently says there cannot be disadvantage to employees? Why abolish that? If you are not about exploitation, why abolish it? Why not leave it there? If you are concerned to ensure that people are protected, that there is no exploitation, why take away the anti-exploitation provision? Why pretend that this is a high wage policy when, quite clearly, by taking that away you are ensuring that for sections of the work force there will be a much lower wage or much lower overall conditions of employment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ABS released figures today which show that activity in the housing sector of the economy is at a very high level. Monthly figures for housing finance approvals for August increased by 8.3 per cent over July and were 23.3 per cent higher than August last year. For the three months to August approvals increased by 10.3 per cent and were 21 per cent higher than in the same three-month period last year. Most significantly, these figures include an increase of more than 6 per cent in lending for the building of new houses in August. Lending for new housing is, of course, an important indicator for future building activities. I can confidently predict that we will see another rise in private sector construction in the September quarter and continuing recovery into 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke with people in the housing industry in Victoria on Friday and they were pleased that, after a bad period, recovery is certainly in place in that State. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today is `Builders hail housing recovery'. The Government can rightly point to a sustained and substantial period of growth. Building starts have increased for five consecutive quarters. No-one, apart from the Opposition, can deny that record. It is time to put aside the negative approaches, the approaches espoused by the Opposition, that tend cynically to regard any sign of recovery as somehow some distortion of the facts. The reality is that we have now had significant recovery over five quarters. We are now looking at very significant recovery indeed. The Master Builders Association has said today, in a document headed `Jump in housing finance welcome news to builders:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's housing finance figures provide optimism that housing recovery is starting to broaden. The current low mortgage interest rates, coupled with competitive house pricing, is making it very attractive for people to enter into home ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Industry Association, referring to home lending being up in August, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good news is that loan commitments for the construction or purchase of newly erected dwellings are up 8%</PARA>
<PARA>This points to future consolidation in the number of housing starts. Competitive housing prices and the stabilising of interest rates have led to the improvement in home buyer confidence. Housing recovery is on track, the Housing Industry Association says, to reach 150,000 starts in 1992-93. In this area of housing what the statistics have now shown right through the course of the year is that housing recovery is not just under way; it is now consolidating so that we see in prospect a very substantial achievement in the housing industry.</PARA>

There has been very little movement across the country so that people who at other times have not been able to get into the housing market are able, as a result of the policies being pursued by the Government, to get into that housing market and buy affordable housing. This is not a time for cynicism; it is a time to recognise that housing is an important leading indicator, and that shows a sign that, where there is confidence in the economy, we will get very significant growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is constant railing and talking down of the economy by the Opposition. With every statistic that comes out a question mark appears, as happened with the honourable member for Forrest today. The Opposition cannot recognise progress and recovery. It constantly talks down those signs. In terms of the housing industry, the position is totally unambiguous. It reflects the Government's policy and indicates the prospect for broader recovery in the economy as a whole.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. This is probably a good place to start because one of the things I was going to mention in the course of the discussion of the matter of public importance about pay TV today, in the unbelievable confusion, is the headline in one of the newspapers today which reads `Caucus rebels over pay TV'. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who has just left the chamber, is well known for his views about pay TV and, as I understand it, is one of those who are involved in the rebellion against the Prime Minister's mark 3 version of pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty, of course, is that mark 3 was announced on Monday night; today we see an unbelievable back flip from elements of the Labor Party and everyone is now ducking for cover. We read this morning that the situation is fluid. The Minister who is supposed to be responsible for pay TV is Minister Collins, but he is in the Senate, unfortunately. That is why we have the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to respond. The Leader of the House is a former communications Minister and I would assume he is across these issues quite well. He knows more than anyone about the unbelievable changes that have been taking place with pay television and the unbelievable confusion that is now rife within the potential bidding community, and indeed the whole community, about where pay TV is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always difficult to know where to start with pay TV because this saga has been going on and on for such a long time, but one of the good places to start is the classic Channel 9 interview with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Many of us will remember it. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program only a little while ago, on 31 May, he said to Laurie Oakes, `We are out to try to create a sort of excitement. We want to really break through the policy log jam. I have just taken over as Prime Minister and I am going to show you how it is done'. He came forward with a few elements&mdash;TAFE, Qantas and also pay TV. Honourable members might remember that. He said this was going to be a revolutionary change and a whole range of new proposals would be put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time it got into a piece of legislation and walked out of this place up to the Senate, it ran into extreme difficulty. It was excised out of the Broadcasting Services Bill and sent to a Senate committee. It was sent to a Senate committee because people who were sensible&mdash;there were many on the Minister's side of the table who had the same view&mdash;took the view that this was all done for the wrong reasons, that it was done in haste and that we had not properly thought through the structure of this new industry. So that piece of the legislation went off to the Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that, at the time the debates took place in this place and in the Senate, several major speeches were delivered. During one of those speeches, the former Minister for Transport and Communications happened to be in here at the table when we were talking about the issue of the ABC in pay TV. He will remember that the Prime Minister said, `Over my dead body. Never, never, ever will we have the ABC in pay TV'. That was a major issue for us. If the Government is going to allow the free to air television networks to be involved in pay TV and migrate into the technologies, we argue that an opportunity ought to be given to the public broadcasters to likewise migrate into pay television, with the new technologies and the services that it might provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question for the Government was: `What will be the detail and how are we to determine this?'. The Prime Minister said no&mdash;it was a flat no. When we were in this chamber debating this, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by one of the leading writers in this area stated that Mr Beazley was sitting there as the member for Bass was indicating why it was that `the ABC should be allowed to play in pay TV'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beazley, sitting at the ministerial table as Smith spoke, unconsciously nodded in agreement as Smith frankly observed that no-one in the Parliament really knew what the best structure was and that the decision the Parliament was about to make was far too important to be politicised in the way Keating had done.</PARA>
<PARA>The writer went on to say that the stand of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was in stark contrast to the pathetic and frankly hypocritical arguments Beazley paraded out before&mdash;about 10:20 pm . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Beazley did not believe in what the Prime Minister did; neither does Senate Collins believe in what the Prime Minister did; nor does half of the Caucus believe in what the Prime Minister did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A decision was taken on Monday night which was released as `Brand new pay TV policy; now nine channels. We are going to pick digital compression technology', which in my view is the correct technology to proceed with. But what happened this morning? The Minister for Transport and Communications went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, and again we start to see a change, a shift. He is now saying, `Look, the ABC should be involved in something other than just news and current affairs. There could be other things that it could do'. But he is just not sure, because he does not know what is going on in the oval office. He does not know what the Prime Minister's views are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty for the Government is that nobody knows. That is why, in our view, either the Prime Minister should be in here addressing this very difficult issue in a meaningful way, or he should hold a press conference and tell the community what is going to happen with pay TV. He should let us know, and let the community know, what is going to happen with pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough for the Prime Minister and just one of his advisers to be making up the decisions about the future of the pay TV industry after such a long period of discussion and debate in this community. Here we are on 14 October and nobody is any the wiser as to where this decision will go next. There are many potential players in the pay TV industry. None of them&mdash;of the ones I spoke to this morning and late yesterday&mdash;has any idea. They are starting to ring my office to ask me what I think the Government is going to do next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) over there. I wonder whether he is going to speak, because he is one of those who might know. He is not a factional heavy like the Minister at the table, but he might know. I understand that he was at that original meeting with the Prime Minister. I refer to the late night meeting where they made the decision. There have been some more late night meetings. We might get a bit of information if we wait around to hear the second speaker in the MPI, because there sits a factional heavy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therein lies the difficulty. We are not making policy to benefit consumers; we are not making policy about what is best for the development of pay TV, the ABC's involvement, the networks' involvement, the telecommunications companies' involvement&mdash;or about what technology we should be using. We are making decisions to meet the concerns of the factions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not all the factions are having a go at this. A couple of faction chiefs went along the other night&mdash;Senator Schacht, and perhaps the honourable member for Burke as well was there&mdash;and they thought they had got a good deal. They thought, `Digital compression&mdash;24 channels&mdash;just think of the choice! That is what we want&mdash;choice'. Then they walked away and discovered that there will only be nine channels available. Four will go to the first licence, a new player; four will be available for people whom the Prime Minister described as the jaded and the faded. We will have two groups. There will be one channel, the ninth, for the ABC to run news and current affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is different from what we are proposing. We are at least hoping that there will be not a duopoly of pay TV operators. The Prime Minister said, `We will do away with the duopoly in the skies'. How often does he jump up here and say, `Duopolies are bad and we are the ones who have made the decision'. He is talking about creating two separate four-channel pay TV operations&mdash;a duopoly of pay TV. He will not have an open bidding system as we have been proposing. When we look at the close detail, or at least at the little bit that we can get, it shows that we will get a duopoly of pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question mark is why? Who benefits, and why only nine? The technology can deliver 24. Why does not the honourable member for Burke tell me, or why does the Minister not tell me why? Whatever happened to the extra choice? We have been arguing about pay TV since 1986. In 1986 the Labor Party put a moratorium on it&mdash;`No pay TV&mdash;it is too difficult'. Certainly it has been too difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that we will not get a decision. It came out on Monday, and by today those opposite have decided they will not make a decision, but will leave it. The Minister again is putting his toe in the water and wondering how far he can get out in front of the Prime Minister to perhaps get a more meaningful policy. I think that the Minister is a genuine trier in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Opposition Members</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Oh, come on. No, no!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think he is. But every time he puts his hand up on an issue, he gets a call from the oval office to say, `No, it has changed'. What is perhaps even worse is that Minister Collins's office had to go to the media who had been briefed by the Prime Minister's office to find out what the policy was before they could answer the calls from other members of the media. This is totally confused. It sends out a signal to the international community about policy paralysis, about the unbelievable flip-flops of the Government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will remember that we heard so much about the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, being a jellyback. We were told that he could not make a decision, that he could not stick to it, but the one who wanted to be Prime Minister was saying, `I can make the tough decisions; I can provide a bit of excitement and lead you to the nirvana of a re-election victory'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But look at pay TV! All it has done is confirm everyone's worst fears. The Prime Minister wants to hold everything to himself; he does not want to have a proper Cabinet process; he does not want to involve his colleagues. We will hear a defence this afternoon, but we all know that it will be a hollow defence from the Leader of the House who has had his difficulties with the current Prime Minister. But it is hypocritical of the current Prime Minister to say that he has a new structure when nobody knows what that new structure is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in the next couple of days some commonsense will start to prevail in this debate. There needs to be some commonsense. We need to understand that we have to have a competitive model for pay TV. To try to mandate all the possible ramifications of the impact of a new technology and a new service delivery system will challenge the wisdom of all in this place. It is not something we ought to undertake with any confidence that we can get an outcome that will visit the consumers&mdash;who, after all, are the people we ought to be putting first&mdash;with a range of services that will be sustainable in the medium to long term in quality and the price that they will be asked to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government has forgotten the fundamental issues that it should be addressing. They are the points we need to hear about. It was this side that put forward the argument that there has to be common customer reception equipment so that there is not a multiplicity of little black boxes. We have been putting forward sensible arguments about media policy for a long time. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has been in this place for a long time. He will be the next Opposition speaker and will give chapter and verse as to the difficulties that this Government has had in its media policy for the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one common thread every time we get to one of these issues is the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). He is there every time. It does not matter who the Minister is&mdash;and we have had five Ministers for communications&mdash;he is there every time to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the product of the Prime Minister's intervention? It is more flip-flop and more confusion. Furthermore, what might well happen now is that we will be denied the possibility of pay TV. I well remember Mr Neil Brown, a former member in this place, putting forward a private member's Bill to try to introduce pay TV into this nation. Of course, it was rejected. But he was trying to challenge the broad view in the Labor Party that this was a technology that we had to stop at all costs. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many in the Labor Party who know that they have to address this problem sensibly. But if they are going to address it and do it in a way that is full of politics&mdash;and that is what they have done&mdash;and try to blind people with the complexities of the technology as an excuse for not making a decision, that is something we can all see through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor members are totally confused. They are sending a very negative signal to the international community about the ability to be able to do business in this country. They are denying the sensible start-up of a new industry which will bring the benefits of manufacturing and choice to this country. We have a regime that we have put to Government members time and time again, and they are gradually seeing the sense of what we are saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor members cannot stand there any longer with their hands over their eyes and allow the Prime Minister to intervene, to ride rough-shod over whoever the Minister is, over his whole Caucus, without explanation to this chamber and to this community. It is an absolute outrage. That is why we have moved this matter of public importance, to give the Government an opportunity to explain. The Prime Minister has always intervened in communications matters, particularly broadcasting matters, and I had hoped to see him in here today to explain himself. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's position can be put on a par with a homely example. If you walk down the street with a wallet in your pocket and somebody picks it, you are to blame. If you walk around a corner and in the course of walking around the corner somebody whacks you over the back of the head and rips your money belt off you, you are to blame for that. After all, you need not have walked around the corner, nor need you have walked down the street. That basically is where we are at now in relation to the pay TV debate as a result of exactly the parliamentary equivalent of that sort of process. It occurred when the Democrats combined with our opponents in the Senate to remove part VII of the Broadcasting Services Bill&mdash;the part dealing with pay TV&mdash;that we put through in the last session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate had before it a series of propositions that would have substantially broadened the operation of those provisions in this country. The Senate had it available to pass at that time to let us get on with the process of putting out tenders for the opportunities that were then available and to proceed with all the sorts of benefits that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) talked about in terms of employment and all the rest of it. All of that was possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that not before us now? It is not because of anything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did; not because of anything that Senator Schacht did; not because of anything that Minister Collins did. It is because of something that Mr Smith did. Mr Smith went to town in the Senate on that particular occasion and what he produced as a result was a Broadcasting Services Bill minus that portion. There was not much that we could do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was indicated to us pretty clearly by those opposite that as far as they were concerned this was going to a committee; it was to go through a delaying process. Why? Because the issue was enormously complex, with all these new technologies coming in and the importance of setting up a competitive regime. That is why the Opposition stopped the Government putting forward a regime, making a determination on this and getting it on the road. Because it was so complex, the technologies were complex, the competitive environment was complex, the matter had to go off to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the committee has reported, we have had the report for a couple of weeks, and we are to make a determination on it. But we are told, `Oh, that is too slow. We have sent it off to a committee to be looked at, we have delayed it on the ground of its complexities, and unless you respond within 24 hours you will have thrown the international markets into total confusion about the direction not just on the policy on pay TV but the whole image of the Government in the international community'. We are told that if we do not respond in the course of 24 hours of the report coming down, those are all the sorts of things that will happen. Terrible!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were a little baffled on this side of the House as to why the Opposition would choose to arrange this. I suppose one of the best defences you have if you have committed an open and public act of policy burglary such as this, the best thing you can do when you are seen running away with a wallet, is to say that the other mob gave it to you. You did not steal it at all; you took it from the other side and raced off into the middle distance with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the other side's wallet was so complex and required a competitive evaluation you took it around the street corner. When you have emptied its contents, you will stick it back via the committee process for committee members to have a look at to see what is left in the wallet after you have been through it over the period of six months. While you are at it, blame them for the appalling delay of recovering their wallet. That is an appalling thing. You have run away; you have withheld it from them for the last six months. As a result of that, they have not had that wallet available to them; they have not been able to show that wallet to the rest of the community. What a heinous crime they have committed for their failures in that regard. They stand condemned. Indeed, something so weighty as a matter of public importance has to be brought on in the House of Representatives just so that we have absolutely clear in our minds the terrible nature of the Government's lack of decision making as a result of having had its legislation burglarised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame the Opposition spokesman for having lost contact with where he sent this during the debate in the last Parliament. It was one of those lost nights which, when I was Minister for Transport and Communications, I was always pleased that he would share with Senator Alston. I did not necessarily have to share at all, being trusting of Senator Collins to handle the business effectively in the Senate. Because he is such a good Minister, I was in a position&mdash;I no longer have the portfolio&mdash;where I was able to place great trust in a very knowledgeable man, technologically particularly knowledgeable, in the form of Senator Collins, now the Minister for Transport and Communications. He, of course, has to now deal with the problem of Senator Alston. Therefore, I did not have to spend my evenings sitting in the advisers box of the Senate; he had to spend his evenings sitting in the box trying to teach the unteachable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of teaching the unteachable&mdash;before he said to the unteachable, `This is far too hard; just whack the wallet off and head for the hills. Don't bother about the explanations, we will find some way of blaming the Government for this act of theft when it all comes back here. Whack that wallet off.'&mdash;he made several attempts to teach them something else. His point of view, to start off with was, `Don't pinch the wallet; just amend its contents. Take it out and convert all the $100 bills into $50 bills and convert all the fifties into twenties and tens. Provide a bit of loose change when you come down to dealing with the fives and then send it across to the other side of the House'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that he had difficulty getting to grips with what particular notes ought to be converted into what. Indeed, the memory of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications was that the Opposition produced six different models between midnight and four in the morning. That is dramatic. Most people would describe that as policy on the run; some people would even describe it as insane. It would be unkind to describe it as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you are teaching the unteachable, as was occurring on this occasion, then I suppose it is quite reasonable to produce six policy models. Having done so, and assuming that the Government had been in a position to accept any one of the six, we subsequently decided to pass that and put whatever that particular proposition was in place. According to the definition of the Opposition spokesman who brought on this matter of public importance today that ought to be a humming signal to the markets that we are doing things really well in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All they needed to do was to have a great deal of confidence in our parliamentary processes, because between midnight and four in the morning we could produce six different models of a pay television regime. The sixth or the fourth or the fifth that we had produced, at whatever point at which we had decided we had so effectively jumbled the notes in the wallet, we had come to a very reasonable and effective conclusion and we need worry no more. I suppose we come to the point of wondering why it was, when they had six particular models and the seeming total attention of the Democrats and the Independents in the Senate at the time which would permit them to get up any one of them, they found life so hard in getting these things through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, of course, we have to have a look at what they did get through and thank our lucky stars at what they did not, because what they did get through in one or two other areas lives on in infamy of the recollections of members of parliament as they deal with great historic events of the day. For example, in one of the particular amendments they got through&mdash;I do not know whether it was moved between 12 midnight and four in the morning but it certainly was spectacular&mdash;further to protecting journalists' sources, because they felt they were insufficiently protected in that Broadcasting Act, they took the matter a point further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amendment was dramatic and revolutionary. It was one which in the clear light of day we could not sustain; nevertheless it was spectacularly interesting. Probably, given the views expressed in other areas and in other places by Senator Schacht on our side, it would have been very much to his taste: it would have meant that judges could be put in gaol for asking journalists to disclose confidential sources. It went from the point where they might have been asked to put forward confidential sources and not be adequately protected in the course of that, to the further extreme where `we will whack them in the chokey'&mdash;that is, the judges&mdash;for asking those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a perfectly adequate simile to the point that I made a little earlier on: when we are picking somebody's pocket and have taken the wallet out of it, make sure he takes the blame. If a judge asks a journalist in the pursuit of seeking advice on any particular matter as to the confidentiality of his sources, whack him straight in the chokey! I am sure that, whilst Senator Schacht would have been honour-bound in the course of rationality and collective decision-making in politics&mdash;he would have voted against that&mdash;there would be certain circumstances in which he would have had some sympathy with that proposition. But overall he could not, so we had to make the necessary adjustments here in order to be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition likes to feel that the propositions it puts forward are devoid of politics; that all it is interested in doing is bringing forward a regime which produces the most open, competitive model and takes account of all the possible ramifications of technology for any particular model that it develops. It seems to view this as a not terribly difficult task, despite the fact that it had six shots at it in the course of that evening. We all know that that is an extremely difficult task indeed, but there is a political agenda brought to it by the Opposition and it is a pretty simple one. Nevertheless, people might like to think about it a little in the course of conversations about this: it concerns the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People can make a reasonable argument about a requirement of the ABC to get itself involved in new technology and, when it does, very considerable caution needs to be exercised in order to ensure it has the fiscal capability of doing that&mdash;the Government was offering it some substantial support in that regard&mdash;and that, in doing that, it does not compromise the capacity that it has had for years now to deliver an impartial source of information, news and views to our people. I say `impartial' in the sense that it is beholden to nobody other than the taxpayer for the resources it has to disseminate the information it has. That is a serious policy issue on which we on this side of the House are divided from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is that the ABC needs to be given the resources to sustain itself. The view of the Opposition is that it needs to be given fewer and fewer resources and compelled to appear more and more as the years go by as a commercial broadcaster. That is a reasonable debate. We can have two views on that; there is no question about it. We on this side of the House have one view and the Opposition has the other view. But, as in the case of the chap who cannot be regarded as wholly innocent when he picks somebody else's pocket and the victim cannot be entirely blamed, likewise in this regard the government which has one particular view on that cannot be entirely blamed for having a view that injects, if you like, a note of politics into the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are arguing the alternative point of view, I would have thought it was quite self-evident that you are also injecting a political element into the debate. When we have an institution&mdash;the freedom of information in this country&mdash;as important to impartial advice to our community on international and domestic affairs as is the ABC, and that is in some way or another at issue on any particular outcome, it should not be regarded as something that can be simply deliberated on and tossed off with the back of the hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it takes you a week or two to respond to a committee report in which these sorts of issues are raised, and you want to give it a bit of thought and allow those in the community who are interested in the positions of the ABC to have their views expressed, and if you have that to the forefront of your mind, I do not think it is necessarily at all justified to stand up and criticise in this place the people who are exercising a degree of caution. Having been obliged by you to revisit the issue&mdash;an issue which could have been settled six months ago&mdash;they might at least, not having had their previous model put up and accepted by you, test the propositions that have come forward from the committee and anything that they are likely to get through. There must be some regard to that fact on its own, let alone all the other enormous complexities that come with the various technologies which now deliver the pay TV system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of very considerable importance in any one of these decisions that you take at any point in time that you act in a way that encourages a competitive voice amongst the commercial sections of the media and likewise act in a way that does not so heinously disadvantage providers via older technologies from being able to have at least an opportunity of some participation in whatever new technology is coming on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is a totally untimely matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition in this regard. It is rather silly given the level of culpability of those opposite in the processes that we are now obliged to go through&mdash;and unnecessary in terms of the very competent Minister, the very competent committees and the very considerable expertise that resides in my Party on these communication matters. So well have we handled communications issues over the years that we have managed to get into what no other government before has been able to, which is a reform of the Broadcasting Services Act and the introduction of competition in telecommunications. At least we have the runs on the board in this area and the Government is quite capable of handling this without the advice of the Opposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no wonder that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who has just sat down, has gone to great lengths to talk about anything but communications policy. In fact it is very suitable that his analogy should have been about walking around the corner and losing one's money because that is certainly what all the operators in the communications industry have been doing; they have been walking around looking for a policy and in the meantime losing their money while something is being done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole history of the communications policy of the Labor Government has been one of total fascination with the leadership. Government members have not been able to get away from it from the Hawke days to the Keating days&mdash;undue interest in the affairs of the Fairfax family and what went on there; undue interest in what went on with the aggregation  policy. They could not get away from that one; they were all around that area. Who were the winners and who were the losers was what we heard consistently coming out as to what was going on in the Labor Party's interest in that area. While the leadership took enormous interest in what was going on in  Fairfax, with aggregations, with the new ownership within the smaller television stations and what was going to happen to Channel Ten, Channel 7 and Channel 9, when they all fell out of bed, the revolving door of ministerial responsibility was taking place&mdash;Duffy, Evans, Willis, Beazley and Collins, not to mention Kerin and Richardson&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fascinated to see that senators seem to be `a special'. We had Button on Monday; we have Collins on Wednesday. Who is next? Apparently there are some geniuses there determining Government policy on both economics and communications. When everyone talks about the coming great revolution in communications and what is going to be done with it, surely to goodness the Government can come up with some policy on communications. The way in which the Labor Government has gone about the handling of this matter has been a thorough disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to raise a couple of points about the handling of the ABC. The ABC plays a role in Australia. I am not a great supporter, but it certainly plays a role throughout the community&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and it deserves a place in the sun. But I find it quite extraordinary that the ABC demands that it be put into this, accepts the news and current affairs restrictions and then says, `Well what are we going to do next? That is not good enough. We have to break out'. That is what we heard this morning on the radio from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) about the ABC going into other programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of running one of these channels, running one of these pods off the satellite, is about half a billion dollars. That is a lot of money. The ABC is running around saying that it does not have enough money to televise football. It is putting a television service into Asia, which I presume will be paid for by clients or the taxpayers. But where is it going to get the money that it is proposing to put into this area? It is a very big question that has to be answered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so opposed to this as time went by? What were the questions and why did he want to knock it out? It is probably time that we looked at the Prime Minister's agenda. What is the Prime Minister's problem, the Prime Minister's dilemma, in all of this? He has had three policies. He had links with the former Minister, Senator Richardson, and we are now into the Keating-Collins area. But also we have to understand the other relationships. When the Aussat satellite was first put into the sky one particular media magnate, Mr Packer, was badgering us daily to get into it&mdash;very heavily. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would recall that very well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The real dilemma facing the Government at the moment is how to win the next election. The most important part of winning the next election is keeping the media in line. So what the Government is doing is spinning out the line to these people. All that the committees are doing at the moment is listening to a long run of people who are going to the Government to twist its arm for a deal here and twist its arm for a deal there. They go around to the Right; they know how to handle the Right in Sydney; there is no problem with that. But then they go to the Left, the only mob that really has no idea what economics is all about. Look at Victoria; it is the only State led by the Left and the Left has completely blown it. When people go and speak to the Left members of a committee or Caucus, they come out with a big thumbs down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go past the factions, we then have Senator Schacht, the institutional expert on every subject&mdash;foreign affairs, communications, factions; no matter what it is, Schacht is into it. So now he has to be consulted on everything. Every time we pick up a paper, he is in on the act. I am not surprised that the Labor Party does not know which way to jump on this. But I do know that it is absolutely imperative for the Prime Minister to keep the media going one way. He got a terrible bump yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking at the annual general meeting of News Ltd, Mr Murdoch said, `I wish the Government would get out of my way'. That is not the way to speak to the Prime Minister. That is not the sort of stuff he wants to hear from Mr Murdoch. The Prime Minister knows that, with election time coming up, if he keeps the lines spinning out there, the chances of keeping the Murdoch newspapers and the like in line are infinitely better. He says, `Let us not make a decision now; let us play it along a bit'. That is why no decisions are coming out of the Labor Party at present. We are going to have to live with indecision, no matter what the smoke screen might be and despite all the factions and all the waffle that the Minister just went through. His heart was not in it. He knows that a sell-out is going on. He was sold out. He was one of those in the revolving door; he went through it. As a consequence of that, the end of the game comes for the Labor Party in that particular neck of the woods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the handling of communications in Australia, which is our most important area for the future&mdash;probably for the next 10 years&mdash;has been appalling. There has been indecision, lack of leadership and consistent personal fiddling in areas where that should not have occurred. I refer particularly to the Fairfax business when the Prime Minister of the day and the Treasurer of the day were in almost daily contact with principal players and were around the gallery. That is well known. What were they so interested in? Their interest was in making sure that the current Fairfax leadership was down and that the new owners, whoever they were&mdash;young Warwick was going to fail&mdash;were suitable. They wanted to bring in someone suitable. As a consequence they played a huge game in the print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite honourable members to look at what happened with aggregation, the games that were played in the radio industry and the licences that went out, and ask who received the special radio licences that were given out in particular areas. There is some very interesting ownership around and that should be looked at. We should look at who is pulling the power in behind the decisions in the current make-up of pay TV. When that one is finally resolved, we should ask who is going to be in cable television, because that is the ultimate prize. If honourable members have any doubt about that, I will quote again from Murdoch's statement on pay TV. In all these areas the sticky fingers of members of the Labor Party are out. They are deeply into the communications area for manipulation, for control of the various forms of the press, and ultimately to try to keep a manipulated area for themselves for the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was mendacious. Today's matter of public importance concerns the inability of the Government to develop a coherent policy. Four months ago the Government arrived at a decision on pay TV. As it turns out, with the benefit of hindsight, it was a decision that was not going to last because things have changed. What changed? First of all, the legislation passed through this House and went over to the Senate. The Senate rejected the legislation. The Senate formed a committee and arising out of that committee was a very significant change in the whole ball game. That was due to a presentation by the owner of the satellite, Optus, to the Senate committee saying that we no longer needed to deal with analog technology, that digital technology&mdash;which means that instead of dealing with six channels we can have anything up to 24 channels&mdash;will be here much faster than anyone had predicted. The industry was telling both the Opposition and the Government that digital technology would not be available for at least five years. The industry is now conceding that it will probably be in the vicinity of two to three years. I will concede that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was absolutely correct&mdash;and I have had arguments with him about it&mdash;all along in saying that one cannot lock out one form of technology from another in this, because it is all moving too fast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened is that the Senate has arrived at the conclusion that this issue needs to be re-thought. The legislation has come back as a result of two key issues. The Senate was not satisfied with the role of the ABC and the model the Government proposed originally and it was not satisfied with the technology model that was being proposed. The legislation has come back to the Government and we have accepted two things. We have accepted that we now have to deal with the digital model. What that means to the people who understand the technology is that whereas we were having to look at a phased-in introduction of a range of channels we are now looking at a much broader option for Australian viewers and one that can be achieved much more quickly. That has meant that the model has changed. A proposal is evolving. I think that the Government will come to some consensus during the next week or so, so that when this House returns in two weeks time it will have a proposal that, hopefully, those opposite who have been complaining about delays will support in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the things we have to take account of in developing this model? The first thing we have to take account of is the technology. I remind those opposite that no-one on this side of the House is interested in revisiting a million imported Japanese video recorders. When Australia moved to videos, VCRs, when the Opposition was in government, there was no attempt to put an Australian industry policy in place. The Opposition just let it be an import policy. We imported into this country half a billion dollars worth of video recorders. We are not prepared to do that with pay TV. We are insisting that digital technology be introduced in Australia via Australian industry to create Australian expertise and jobs. If it takes a few months longer to develop the industry capability, rather than just imports, we will happily cop the delays because we want the jobs and the expertise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are working through the industry policy. That means that when Australians go down to the electronics shop and buy their pay TV receiver to hook up to the satellite on their roof they will not be buying a model like the Opposition introduced, with VHS on one side of the video shop and Beta models on the other, and hoping for heaven's sake that they have bought the right model. We are not interested in that. We are going to determine the technology that will suit all pay TV channels and all consumers. We are going to take our time and we make no apology for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to have open slather for imported movies and imported production of film and content. We are desperately keen to promote the Australian film, television and production industry. It is part of our media policy. We are writing into this legislation very strong Australian content rules to ensure that the pay TV that we receive in Australia, when people look at all those other channels, does have strong Australian film, news and sport content in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members of this House have travelled overseas. They know that they can stay in a hotel somewhere overseas and turn on anything up to 50 channels of television. Most of it is from all over the place and we would say that a lot of it is junk. If we are introducing pay TV and up to 12 extra channels of television for people who are going to be paying for it and receiving it by subscription, it is going to have solid Australian content. I do not think anybody should be criticising the Government for that. If it takes a little time we will take time, but it is coherent. To come in here and say that the Government, via a delay process that the Opposition started in the Senate, is in some way holding up the industry is being less than honest about the whole issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of other points to mention. The ABC will have a role in pay TV. It is totally dishonest to claim that the Prime Minister is opposed to the ABC being involved in pay TV. It is reasonable to say that the Prime Minister and other members of the Government are concerned about an open-ended financial commitment. We are looking at a model whereby the ABC can be involved with pay TV, but not be up for massive running costs. We should remember that the ABC does not have the capacity to earn revenue from other areas. It may be competing with other network giants who have magazines, advertising or film production around the world and so have some means by which they can subsidise the operation of their pay TV outfit. The ABC does not have that funding source; it is reliant totally on government funding. So we have to find a way to get the ABC involved without an open-ended financial commitment that finishes up in the Budget. We will work our way through that, and the ABC will be a key player. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are working our way through the very significant change in digital technology; we are working our way through the role of the ABC; we are determined that the future opportunities in this industry, both in Australia and the Asia-Pacific area, will be taken up by Australians for Australians; and we are determined to stick to our guns on industry policy and film and production content. If it means a duopoly model between 1992 and 1997, so be it. But everybody understands that the Government is committed to an open and competitive regime in 1997, after the industry has had the opportunity to get itself established and the consumer base is there. As I have said before, we will not revisit Japanese video recorders, VHS and Beta, and the whole mess that those opposite made of that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Throsby)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth report of the Committee for 1992 relating to the office construction at section 45, Belconnen, ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Committee's ninth report for 1992 deals with the construction of a five-storey office building in the Canberra suburb of Belconnen. The building will be occupied by the ACT regional office of the Australian Taxation Office. It will have a gross floor area of 22,000 square metres of which 14,100 square metres will be for offices. The ground floor of the building will contain public access areas and an automatic document dispatch centre. The four upper storeys will contain office areas and staff amenities. The estimated completed cost of the building will not exceed $40.9m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that the work should proceed, and also recommends a number of features being incorporated in the design. These involve the installation of a gas co-generation plant to provide electrical power to the building, the installation of a dimmed lighting system, as opposed to a switched control lighting system, the removal of fill from the site' and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of arguments were advanced which purported to demonstrate that the use of a gas co-generation plant in the building would not be practical or economical. The Committee remains unconvinced about the weight of these arguments and has recommended that a gas co-generation plant be installed. A gas co-generation plant has a number of environmental benefits and its installation in a building owned by the Commonwealth will be a reflection of the Government's commitment to energy conservation and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the building be provided with an automatic light dimming system. The system adjusts light levels automatically to compensate for the amount of daylight reaching the inside of the building. On bright sunny days, the lights are automatically dimmed and, on overcast days or during darkness, the light intensity is automatically increased. The Committee believes this method of lighting control is far superior to a switched control system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site contains a large amount of fill which will need to be removed before excavation can commence. The Committee has recommended that the contract for the removal of the fill should not preclude its sale by the successful tenderer. Nevertheless, the final destination of the fill should be determined and, if it is offered for sale, the cost of its removal should be adjusted accordingly. The Committee questioned the extent and cost of landscaping proposed and has recommended that the scope of landscaping be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of its current heavy workload, the Committee has decided to table a short report recommending that the work proceed and enabling Australian Estate Management to adhere to its construction timetable. It must nevertheless be made clear that the Committee is seriously concerned about being placed in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following points in this regard, lest there be any subsequent comment about the Committee's processes causing delays to the commencement of public works, which is a charge that the bureaucrats are not slow to put on us sometimes. In late January Australian Estate Management requested the Committee to approve the commencement of design and documentation and preliminary tender negotiations. The Committee agreed with this in late February. Australian Estate Management was hoping for an early hearing into the proposal and for the Committee's report to be tabled before the winter recess. The proposal was not referred to the Committee until 25 June of this year, which was too late for the Committee to conduct its public hearing and present its report before the winter adjournment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 July Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to call tenders for the excavation and foundation works in advance of the report being tabled in Parliament. The Committee's approval to do this was given on 28 July. The Committee at this time was optimistic that its report could be tabled by mid-October. However, because of the large number of references which had been received by the Committee in the intervening months&mdash;and we are about to receive three more today&mdash;which tended to rearrange the timetable of hearings and report preparation and over which the Committee had very little control, the Committee was unable to meet this unrealistic deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 September Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to award the earthworks contract in advance of the tabling of the Committee's report. The provisions of the Public Works Committee Act do not permit this course of action to be followed. This highlights the need for all departments and agencies to adhere closely to planned milestones during the development of a proposal. In this instance, Australian Estate Management planning proceeded on the basis of a favourable report from the Committee before the winter adjournment. The Committee believes the time has come to give the strongest possible signal to all departments and agencies that, in future, it will not have imposed on it unrealistic and unreasonable schedules which presuppose peremptory inquiries and approval of works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to particularly thank the other Committee members for the assistance they gave me in the preparation of this report. I particularly want to thank the secretarial staff and single out the Assistant Secretary, Michael Fetter, and our newest recruit, Sophia Konti. Only late yesterday did we get the first draft of this report for the Committee to go through. After the Committee went through it late yesterday, the secretariat staff worked late into the night. At midday today the Committee was again brought together and the final report was approved. There were some amendments to that, which meant the secretarial staff again worked on it, and only 10 minutes before I came into this chamber did I get the final draft. The staff concerned with the preparation of this report worked far beyond the call of duty. On behalf of the Committee, I thank them for their dedication and the work they put into this. In conclusion, I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Opposition generally supports this proposal, subject to the caveat and the qualifications expressed by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As another member of the Public Works Committee, I add my thanks to all those concerned with bringing this report forward in such a timely manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make two comments. The first relates to a point made by the honourable member for Throsby about the unnecessary speed which this matter had to be dealt with. All departments should understand that in doing this we are not making an exception. They must observe the due processes of the legislation and the procedures of what is arguably the busiest joint statutory committee in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point, on which the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) might wish to comment, relates to one aspect which has not been mentioned in relation to the national office of the Australian Taxation Office as distinct from the regional office of the ATO, which is referred to in this report. The national office will be reduced over the next 10 years by about 1,000 staff. There was some discussion in the Public Works Committee as to whether the project before us in this proposal would be better sited in Civic than in Belconnen and that the national office might go to Belconnen instead. I hope the honourable member for Fraser will take it on board that the Parliament must not in a few years be faced with a reversal of that position and with unnecessary expenditure of public moneys. Other than that, the Opposition has much pleasure in supporting the project. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Fraser)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) on getting this decision through very quickly. The planning for this office block was very thorough. It involved consultation with the staff of the Australian Taxation Office. A survey was made as to where staff members wanted the office located. The majority of the 600 staff wanted it located in Belconnen. That was a welcome approach to planning and a welcome outcome. It means that more of the office work is located outside Civic; it is dispersed to Belconnen, which is what the principles involved in the planning of Canberra require at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for planning in Canberra has been that work opportunities should be dispersed around the town&mdash;not concentrated in Civic, but spread in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong so that we avoid the problems of congestion and high office costs that are experienced in a lot of other cities in Australia. Therefore, this step towards that dispersal is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case can be made for having the national office of the Australian Taxation Office in Belconnen as well. I fully accept that it would be wasteful to try to transfer the two now. But I hope that when the time comes, the national office will also be located, perhaps co-located, with the regional office in Belconnen, because that would achieve the dispersal of employment opportunity that we want and bring those two parts of the Taxation Office together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this approval because it means improved working conditions for the regional office staff; it means increased work for the local construction industry; and it does so in a part of the town that needs it very badly. I support and thank the Committee for its consideration of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO) to Wollongong.</PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service is responsible for the publication of nautical charts and other information required for the safety of ships navigating in Australian waters. On 24 June 1992 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) announced that the Australian Hydrographic Office, the AHO, would be relocated to Wollongong and asked that work proceed to the point where the project could be considered by the Public Works Committee. Navigational services, currently provided from the AHO in North Sydney and to be relocated to Wollongong, include chart compilation and publishing, chart maintenance&mdash;updating&mdash;chart distribution, provision of texts such as tide tables and sailing directions, and an extensive archive of survey documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Hydrographic Office is presently located in an eight-storey Defence-owned building in North Sydney. The standard of accommodation is poor and poses operational difficulties which give rise to many inefficiencies. The single most significant limitation in the existing building, apart from the overall floor space available in the building, is the maximum useable area on each floor. This obliges chart production staff to commute continually between floors to carry out different aspects of their daily work schedule. Operationally, the building is inefficient for the functions performed. These inefficiencies cannot be overcome by alteration or refurbishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new facilities are proposed to be located in Station Street, adjacent to the Wollongong railway station and the new Taxation Office building to be completed in 1993. The proposed facilities will comprise a two-level podium containing entry foyer, stores, registry and a welcoming room at the ground level, with an upper level car park for 40 vehicles. Above the podium will rise the five-level office tower, with each floor having a nominal net area of 800 metres square. The top floor is stepped back to the north to provide a covered roof deck for staff recreational and leisure use. The structured car park above ground was selected to avoid excavation of the rock sub-base present at the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that preliminary design will be completed by March 1993, documentation by May 1993 and construction of the base building by December 1993. Fit out and commissioning of the building, together with installation and testing of equipment, is expected to be completed by February 1994 in advance of occupation from 1 March 1994. The cost budget for the proposed work is $10m at October 1992 prices, encompassing the fit out, furniture and fittings, including furniture work stations. An additional $2.5m has been budgeted to cover project expenses, equipment, land acquisition and contingency to meet the total project cost at October 1992 prices of $12.5m. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the referral to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works of this work to relocate the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong. Honourable members on this side of the House, and no doubt honourable members opposite, have enormous respect for the Hydrographic Office and the fundamentally important job that it undertakes on behalf of the Department of Defence. The work of the Hydrographic Office and its contribution to the defence of the nation are often underrated. There is still a very long way to go to finish the hydrographic work which began with Captain Cook in 1770. Some excellent work has been done by DSTO to facilitate that process with its LADS scheme. I wish the Hydrographic Office, particularly with its new LADS aircraft, all the best in getting on with that gigantic task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the relocation of the Hydrographic Office from North Sydney to Wollongong has been motivated by political considerations by the Government, which is intent on trying to improve its flagging fortunes in the economically depressed Wollongong area. It is not a decision which has been based in any way on considerations of how best to use taxpayers' money. That may sound, as the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is at the table, seems to be suggesting, like a bit of rhetoric from an Opposition wanting to make a political point, but I happen to have with me in the House today to reinforce this matter&mdash;and it is a document that I would like the Public Works Committee to take into account in the process of its reference&mdash;a confidential memo written by Mr A.S. Podger, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisitions and Logistics in the Department of Defence, to Minister Ray and repeated to Minister Bilney, the CDF, the Secretary to the Department, CNS and CGS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this document Mr Podger, on behalf of the Department, makes a number of extremely interesting points. The document shows that Defence actually put Wollongong third and last in a list of three options for relocating the Hydrographic Office. The Defence document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leichhardt remains the preferred location on cost-benefit grounds;</PARA>
<PARA>This is according to Mr Podger's confidential minute to the Minister. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newcastle, at best remains marginally more expensive than Leichhardt, but has the risks of higher cost, lower benefit and added disruption;</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure honourable members from Newcastle will not be pleased to hear that. The minute goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant margin. Defence would be required to buy land and pay carparking contributions not applicable in other options. It would entail similar disruption as Newcastle to the work of the office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was given the memo off the back of a truck, as is often said. This memo is, by the way, dated 23 April 1992. I know that the honourable member for Herbert is interested in the memo. A little later I will seek leave to table it so he will have the opportunity to peruse it, because it will interest him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting and not surprising that Mr Podger comes to the following fairly obvious conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recommend that you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">agree the selection of Leichhardt as the most cost-effective site for the relocation of the Hydrographic Office and that the Department proceed with the formal processes for project approval and PWC clearance.</PARA>
<PARA>The subject of PWC clearance is beginning in this very debate. There was a subsequent meeting between Minister Ray, Minister Bilney and the Department where they decided to have another look at this. The minutes that we have been able to obtain do not tell us why they decided to reconsider it, but I think that is obvious for all to see. Taxpayers' money does not matter to them, does it, as long as a few votes are squared away for the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These findings by the Department were not based on its assessments alone; they were based on an assessment which was also made by an independent consultant, and approval was given to the work done by the independent consultant. It is interesting to note that the Minister, in moving the motion, gives no better reason for the relocation than to say that the existing eight-floor office is inconvenient to personnel who need to move between floors. The Government is actually proposing to move those people who have to work on eight floors into a building of what? A level building? No, a building of five floors. It saves them three floors&mdash;I concede that point&mdash;at a fair cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A subsequent minute dated 24 June 1992 from the Department of Defence to the Minister&mdash;another confidential minute which appears to be in my hand at the moment, if I can put it that way&mdash;refers to the Department's concern about the relocation of staff to Wollongong, or the commuting they would have to do to Wollongong. This is a matter of great concern, as I am sure the honourable member for Herbert knows, amongst those tremendously professional staff who are working at the moment in Walker Street, North Sydney. In this minute to the Minister, Mr Podger says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. relocation costs to Newcastle or Wollongong might come down depending on the number of staff not prepared to move, but this could be offset if they were not redeployable and redundancy costs were incurred;</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the things the Department is thinking about: making some of the staff redundant. Mr Podger goes on to say to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. there is a clear preference of staff to remain in Sydney, with Newcastle a distant second preference and Wollongong clearly third; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the effect of any intercity relocation on the operations of the Hydrographic Office would clearly involve some disruption, and Navy  views might be sought.</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, when it comes to votes for the ALP, who cares about the views of the Royal Australian Navy? They would be extremely expendable. The final point I want to make is that in the Minister's&mdash;</PARA>

According to the Minister in his speech, at October 1992 prices the project will cost $12.5m. Is that what the Department thinks in its confidential minute? Answer, no. The Department estimates that the cost of moving to the Wollongong site is $19.3m. How the Government gets $12.5m out of $19.3m, one does not know, but doubtless it is through some sort of creative accounting&mdash;and this is something the Public Works Committee will have an entertaining time examining.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is over $2m cheaper than Wollongong. In a sense, that is the price we pay for pork-barrelling politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The computer bounty is an important element of the Government's policy for the computer industry which includes manufacturers of modems, multiplexers, microprocessors, computer sub-assemblies, electronic microcircuits and, since July 1991, printed circuit boards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of the computer bounty scheme in 1990, which resulted in the extension of the scheme until 31 December 1995, reflects a commitment by this Government, and indeed this Parliament, to encouraging increased development and use of computer equipment and microprocessor technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92 the computer bounty program provided about $74m of direct assistance to 516 registered manufacturing premises. The program is expected to provide $71m to industry in 1992-93 and similar levels in forward years with the adoption of the legislative changes proposed in this Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in particular introduce a definition of `research and development' in clause 4 of the Bill to clarify and limit the eligible expenditure which might be included under this phrase. This proposed definition, together with clause 5 of the Bill, expressly requires that, in order for expenditure on research and development to qualify for inclusion in a manufacturer's bountiable factory costs, the research and development must be likely to result in the manufacture of bountiable equipment within the bounty period; that is, by 31 December 1995. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other substantive amendments in this Bill which are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

<PARA>This Bill introduces a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers who are injured in the course of their employment. It will replace the outdated and inadequate Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 with modern and comprehensive rehabilitation and compensation arrangements similar to those applicable to Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the Government commissioned Professor Harold Luntz to conduct a review of the policy basis and the operation of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911. The terms of reference of the review required Professor Luntz to consider the desirability of consistency between the seamen's compensation legislation and the proposals being developed at that time for the new Commonwealth employees workers' compensation legislation. These proposals were subsequently enshrined in the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, or CERC Act for short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Luntz's review of seamen's compensation was tabled in Parliament in June 1988. Since that time the Luntz review recommendations have been the subject of extensive consultations involving shipowners, the maritime unions and the ACTU. The outcome of this process is a Bill which radically moves away from the outmoded compensation regime which the Seamen's Compensation Act provides. The new scheme will combine fair, earnings-related benefits with comprehensive rehabilitation requirements and other measures aimed at getting injured employees restored to health and back to work as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also restores the former nexus with the workers' compensation legislation applicable to Commonwealth employees. This is consistent with the unitary compensation structure applying across public and private sector employment in all the State and Territory workers' compensation schemes. This is a large and complex Bill with many essentially technical provisions. These are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is appropriate, however, to draw the attention of honourable members to the main features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Liability and Insurance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The new arrangements will be based on individual employer liability. This acknowledges that the individual employers and their insurers already have the necessary infrastructure in place to manage such arrangements and that the imposition of a Government fund on such a small industry, with around 6,000 employees, would not be cost-effective. In order that employers will be able to meet their liabilities, the Bill requires them to be insured with an insurer authorised under the Insurance Act 1973 or be indemnified by a protection and indemnity association which is a member of the international group of protection and indemnity associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a special industry wide `safety net' fund to provide coverage for industry trainees and for temporarily unemployed seafarers while attending seafarers engagement centres in accordance with industry labour pooling arrangements. Both these categories of persons are employed by the industry as a whole, rather than by individual employers. The safety net fund will also be the nominal insurer. In other words, if the employer or the employer's insurer is unable to meet liabilities because of bankruptcy, for example, the fund will meet those liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision for the industry-wide fund to be established in one of two ways&mdash;a fund operated by employers collectively as a corporate entity or a fund operated by the administering authority.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the Minister to approve a corporate body as the fund, provided it meets stipulated conditions. Industry employers have already established such a corporate entity. However, if the industry fund should ever fail to meet the stipulated conditions, the Minister has the power to revoke the approval of the corporate body and declare the administering authority to have the functions, powers and obligations of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benefits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the benefits which will be payable under this legislation. These benefits will be aligned with those currently payable to injured public sector workers covered by the CERC Act. Like the CERC Act, the benefits will be indexed annually in line with consumer price index movements. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Incapacity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>At the heart of the new scheme is the change from a system of fixed long term benefits adjusted by regulation to one of weekly benefits calculated on the basis of the individual employee's normal weekly earnings. Employees who are totally incapacitated for work will receive weekly benefits equal to normal weekly earnings for the first 45 weeks of that incapacity. Partially incapacitated employees will receive benefits to bring their wages up to normal weekly earnings during that period. After 45 weeks of incapacity the basic rate of benefits applicable reduces to 75 per cent of normal weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of benefits payable to partially incapacitated employees who are able to work will be on a graduated scale. For these persons the combined total of compensation plus earnings will be between 75 per cent and 100 per cent of normal weekly earnings, depending on the number of hours that the employee actually works. Weekly payments will not normally be paid beyond the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Permanent Impairment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the weekly benefits for incapacity which I have just outlined, the Bill provides for the payment of lump sums for permanent impairment. Under the current Seamen's Compensation Act, lump sum payments are made on the basis of a table of maims. The range of maims compensated is exclusive and does not recognise the broad range of work-related injuries and diseases. This outdated and crude approach will be replaced with a much more comprehensive and fair method using the modern concepts already adopted in assessing permanent impairments for war veterans and injured Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Non-economic Loss</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conjunction with an assessment of permanent impairment there will be an assessment of related factors defined as non-economic loss. These factors include pain and suffering, loss of quality of life and shortened life expectancy. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rehabilitation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the most important feature of the new scheme, rehabilitation. Early and effective rehabilitation cuts the human and monetary costs of serious industrial injury by helping to repair the physical damage and, equally importantly, by overcoming the `compensation mentality' that can so easily overwhelm injured employees when left to their own devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare attributes a major part of its success in reducing its compensation costs to the similar rehabilitation arrangements applicable to Commonwealth employees under the CERC Act. Since the CERC Act came into operation in late 1988, the number of incapacity cases lasting more than four weeks has halved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires employers to arrange a rehabilitation assessment of any injured employee whose incapacity lasts, or is expected to last, 28 days. If that assessment concludes that a rehabilitation program is appropriate, the employer will be required to engage an approved program provider to develop and conduct an appropriate rehabilitation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage a positive attitude towards the program, the injured employee will be required to be fully consulted in the development of the program arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets down special procedures for the first stage reconsideration process, requiring the employer to obtain the assistance of either a Comcare officer or an industry panel. The Comcare officer or industry panel, as the case may be, will provide the employer with an independent assessment of the merits of the claim. The claimant will also receive a copy of this assessment. The assessment will not be binding on either party but the process is expected to result in most cases being resolved quickly without recourse to the AAT.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to common law actions for negligence. Common law negligence actions are counter-productive to the fundamental objective of helping injured employees rebuild their lives and return to employment as quickly as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the employee will be required to make an irrevocable election that he or she intends to pursue a common law action before any lump sum compensation benefit for permanent impairment and non-economic loss has been paid.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no restriction on employees pursuing common law actions against third parties.

<PARA>This Bill gives effect to Australia's obligations arising from the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, known as the Madrid Protocol. The Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, and puts in place a legally binding and comprehensive regime for protection of its environment. The Government has shown leadership in Antarctic environmental matters and already has made significant progress in implementing the requirements of the protocol. This Bill will enable Australia to move forward to ratification of the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Madrid Protocol stands amongst the world's most significant environmental agreements. It is unique in setting out to ensure the protection of the environment of an entire continent. It is an outstanding demonstration of countries working together on environmental protection. Australia thus takes great pride in its role in leading its treaty partners to adoption of the protocol in October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere in the world in recent years we have seen attention given to the longstanding problems of pollution, insensitive development, and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. We have learned from our mistakes. In Antarctica we had a continent seemingly immune from the environmental problems, but our view of Antarctica changed as we came to understand what is happening in the atmosphere. It was Antarctica that revealed the depletion of ozone. Antarctica is a continent of enormous scientific potential; a continent that may provide invaluable information about the health of the environment in the rest of the world. The Government recognised that Antarctica can only do this if we fully protect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica, once far removed from the attention of most of the world, came to prominence in the 1980s. The decade saw dramatic developments in Antarctic environmental policy, reflecting the increased attention given to the environment worldwide. Antarctica's unique environment provides the setting for a unique approach to international relations. For over 30 years the Antarctic Treaty has set aside the differences between countries and provided the framework for unrivalled cooperation between the 40 countries that are party to it. As an original signatory to the treaty, Australia is fully committed to supporting the Antarctic Treaty and encouraging the consensus approach to decisions about Antarctica's future. The Government therefore believes that by strong support for, and effective contribution to, the treaty system we can achieve the best possible measures to protect the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, the most significant recent development in the Antarctic Treaty system was the adoption in 1991 of the Madrid Protocol. Adoption of the protocol represented a dramatic change in attitude by the treaty countries to what are acceptable activities in Antarctica. Following six years of negotiation of a regime that would allow the possibility of mining in Antarctica, the treaty parties have agreed to a regime that prohibits mining. The Government's leadership on this issue was instrumental in achieving what is now recognised as one of the world's most outstanding examples of international cooperation in protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiation of the protocol followed the Government's decision in May 1989 that Australia would not sign the Antarctic minerals convention. The Government had concluded that mining could not be undertaken consistent with protection of the environment. Instead, the Government proposed that treaty parties negotiate a regime which would prohibit mining and provide for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government announced its decision it was warmly welcomed by the public. However, overseas, Australia's proposals were not received enthusiastically by many of our treaty partners. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, acknowledged in his announcement that we had set ourselves an ambitious task. However, concerted efforts by the Government culminated in the adoption of the protocol after some two years. The Government takes this opportunity to place on record its appreciation for the skilful negotiation efforts of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Antarctic Division of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these negotiations Australia was supported initially by France. Italy and Belgium also came to support our proposals and following a meeting of treaty parties in November 1990, further support for the Australian position emerged. In Madrid, less than a year later, the treaty parties adopted the protocol signalling achievement of the objective of putting in place comprehensive and legally binding measures to protect the Antarctic environment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the context in which the protocol was negotiated, its most significant feature is article 7, which prohibits activities relating to mineral resources other than scientific research. This article represents the commitment of the treaty parties to set aside a whole continent from what was potentially one of the most environmentally destructive activities. The Government had, of course, recognised the need to provide legal means to prevent such activities in 1990, prior to conclusion of the protocol, and we had passed legislation prohibiting mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory and prohibiting Australian involvement in mining anywhere in the Antarctic. This legislation, the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Act 1991, will now be incorporated in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 for the sake of completeness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is, of course, delighted that the protocol has put in place the mining prohibition that we sought. However, the protocol is much more than a ban on mining, and there are many other significant environmental protection provisions within the protocol and its annexes. These provisions will ensure that activities undertaken in Antarctica are done in the most environmentally responsible way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of adoption of the protocol, 4 October 1991, four annexes had been agreed. These provide detailed measures relating to environmental impact assessment; conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; waste disposal and waste management; and prevention of marine pollution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental part of the protocol's mechanisms to ensure that activities take account of environmental values is Annex I. The protocol requires prior assessment of all activities proposed to be conducted in the Antarctic Treaty area to assess likely impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems. Annex I specifies the procedures that are to be followed to ensure that proposed activities are appropriately assessed. The intention of the environmental impact assessment process is not to prevent activities from proceeding but rather to ensure that they are undertaken in a way that takes into account, and minimises as far as practicable, any environmental impacts. The Bill puts in place an assessment scheme that relies on three levels of impact assessment according to the extent of likely impacts, and provides for conditions to be imposed on activities so that the actual impacts can be assessed and verified. The Bill provides for regulations to be made relating to detailed aspects of the procedures. </PARA>

Consequently, as the existing measures have been implemented into Australian law, this Bill proposes to amend that Act by incorporating the additional requirements of the protocol relating to the protection of fauna and flora. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Annex II includes a provision prohibiting the introduction of non-indigenous species into the Antarctic. One aspect of the requirements is the obligation to remove huskies from Antarctica by 1 April 1994. Within Australia the Government's acceptance of this provision has been difficult. Australia is one of only three Treaty countries that still uses dog teams in Antarctica and during negotiation of the protocol Australia argued strongly for retention of the dogs. However, our position became untenable in view of Australia's strong push for comprehensive environment protection measures. Only one of Australia's Antarctic stations still maintains dogs. Even though the dogs at Mawson are well managed there remains the possibility of dogs breaking free and attacking wildlife, or wildlife straying into the dog lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is arranging to remove the dogs in accordance with its obligations as a signatory to the protocol and consistent with the decision of the treaty parties to implement the protocol as far as possible pending its entry into force. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to implement a package of measures to enhance the future of the Australian wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package provides a framework for the development of a vertically integrated industry to the end of the century. It has the endorsement of the peak wheat grower body, the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council agreement on these measures exemplifies the Government's approach to rural industry policy. We have strong views on where our rural industries should be heading and we have a clear vision for their future. But we do not impose changes on those industries. We consult closely with them on proposed improvements and work together to attain our shared vision for their future. This is the approach that I have recently adopted with the dairy, wool and sugar industries and which I have now applied to the wheat and grains industries. Such an approach gives greater confidence to industry participants in planning their futures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wheat is Australia's most valuable crop with an estimated gross value of production in 1992-93 of $2.2 billion. Wheat is also one of Australia's most important exports and this year will be our third largest rural export earner after wool and meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package has regard to the particular circumstances of the industry and the environment in which it currently operates. It represents a further step in the evolution of wheat marketing arrangements. For many years the Australian Wheat Board held a monopoly over the sales of all Australian wheat on domestic and export markets. Three years ago this Government deregulated the domestic wheat market and thereby introduced competition to the Wheat Board within Australia. Since then, on export markets, the Wheat Board has moved further away from being a supplier of bulk homogenous wheat and instead has also pursued niche markets for specific qualities of wheat based on customers' needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes helped to inspire the Grains Council to hold the Grains 2000 Conference in September 1991. I gave the concluding address to that conference where I set out my views on the future directions for the industry. I stressed the long term decline in the terms of trade for Australian agricultural producers and pointed out that, on the other hand, growth in the trade of value added food products was increasing. Moreover, Australia was well situated to take advantage of the growth in demand for these products in the populous and increasingly wealthy countries of Asia. I urged the industry to raise its sights and direct more of its resources to take advantage of the growth in demand for value added food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that at that conference industry leaders shared many of my views on the future vision for the industry. Grains Council leaders Andrew Inglis and Donald McGauchie and Wheat Board Chairman Clinton Condon also spoke of the need for the industry to move away from being solely a supplier of bulk raw material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other important issues raised at the conference were the export powers of the Wheat Board and the future capital base for the industry. Both of these issues, as well as value adding, are addressed in the package implemented by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Grains 2000 Conference, an extensive process of consultation was set up by the Grains Council with the involvement of the Wheat Board and my Department. Expert consultants were engaged to advise on the financial and structural aspects of future grains marketing. This process led to the publication in April this year of what became known as the Newco proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the months following, the Grains Council organised an extensive series of grower meetings in all mainland States to debate the Newco proposal. I welcomed these meetings as a means of ensuring that growers were fully consulted on the issues. I had earlier expressed reservations about some aspects of the proposal. Moreover, after the consultative process was complete, it was clear that the Newco proposal in its original form did not have the support of the majority of growers; nor, however, did the alternative proposals which had been put forward over the last year or so, such as those from the various State grower bodies and from the Australian Grain Exporters Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However there was general support for certain elements of these proposals and this support has been embodied in the package of measures before the House. These elements are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a continued build-up in the industry's capital base through the wheat industry fund levy;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly in light of the current uncertain outcome in the GATT round and the highly corrupted state of the world wheat market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the continued build-up of a capital base is essential to ensure the industry's future. Such a view is shared by the industry. Currently, the Wheat Board borrows heavily during the season to make advance payments to growers. Those borrowings are guaranteed by the Government under an arrangement which was scheduled to end on 30 June 1994. The financial consultants to the Grains Council and to the Wheat Board have estimated that the wheat industry fund would need to build to over $400m to provide sufficient capital for the Wheat Board to make advance payments to growers at around current levels without a government guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Grains Council have therefore agreed that the fund will continue for five years past 1994, until June 1999.

Until now, the Wheat Board's involvement in value adding has been limited to investment only. </PARA>

However, the Government has decided that now is not the appropriate time to change the Wheat Board's export powers. All honourable members will be aware of the corrupt state of the world wheat market where the subsidy war between the United States and the European Community has been waged for many years now.

Any additional expenditure incurred by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be absorbed within the Commission's present budget.

Rearrangement of the provisions for complaints to the Ombudsman in the Freedom of Information Act and deletion of the reference to subsection 6(3) of the Ombudsman Act 1976 in the relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act necessitate consequential amendments to subsection 22(8) of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. </PARA>

This amendment reaffirms a long line of judicial authority which was said to be wrong in a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in respect of statutory provisions in that State dealing with the power of that court to award costs.

The National Companies and Securities Commission was abolished on 31 July 1992 and the Act will be amended to continue after the abolition an exemption from applications under the Act for documents of the Commission that were exempt under section 47 of the Act prior to that abolition. Section 56 of the Act gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the power to hear appeals where an agency has failed to make a decision within the required time limits and the agency is deemed to have made a decision refusing to grant access to a document or refusing to amend or annotate a record of personal information as appropriate. Where an agency makes a decision, between the time the appeal is made to the Tribunal and the time that the Tribunal has finally dealt with the matter, subsection 56(5) gives the Tribunal the power to extend the proceedings by reviewing the decision that has actually been made if the applicant for review wants it to do so and if the agency has not granted the applicant's request in full and in the manner sought.

Section 33 was amended in 1991 to delete references to the public interest. Section 33A was also amended so that a certificate issued under subsection (2) or (4) conclusively establishes both that disclosure would affect relations with a State or Territory and that disclosure would not on balance be in the public interest.

The amendments will also deal with a number of anomalies in the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act that have been brought to the Government's attention by industry and the Privacy Commissioner in the course of implementing those provisions. The proposed amendments have the support of the Privacy Commissioner and have been prepared after consultations with interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Securitisation is a recent development in the credit industry. While provision for it was made in the Privacy Act when it was amended by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1991, the complexity of the industry has required clarification and revision of the current provisions, which as a matter of strict law do not always easily accommodate the particular practices involved in asset and mortgage securitisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Securitisation, which is also known as the secondary mortgage market, refers to a method of financing often used in housing finance, but is also used in relation to other assets. A mortgage financed ostensibly by a credit union or building society, usually called an originator, will under a mortgage securitisation arrangement be ultimately financed by using funds invested by investors in a trust. The form of such arrangements varies significantly, but usually there is a formal legal trustee of the trust fund, although the fund is often managed on a day to day basis by a trust manager. The trust manager deals with credit enhancers who actually take the financial risk by underwriting the securitisation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will define a securitisation arrangement and will deem bodies involved in a securitisation arrangement to be credit providers. They will be placed under the same obligations as other credit providers under the Act while they are performing a task relevant to the securitisation scheme. They will, however, be different from other credit providers in that they will be able to obtain credit information from other members of the scheme without the consent of the borrower. This variation of the Act's normal policy on disclosure of information by credit providers is necessary as a result of the special nature of mortgage securitisation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consequence of deeming bodies involved in mortgage securitisation arrangements to be credit providers is that credit enhancers will be able to obtain access to credit reports from credit reporting agencies in their own right. Fundamentally, the amendments do not represent a major change from the policy of the existing provisions. However, they will clarify the circumstances under which bodies involved in securitisation arrangements can have access to consumer credit information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been conscious for some time of the difficult situation faced by guarantors or would-be guarantors in finding out information about the persons they are guaranteeing. Equally, credit providers lack certainty in deciding what information they are required or permitted by law to disclose to would-be guarantors, given that such disclosures are exceptions to their duty of confidentiality to their clients and the information that can be disclosed can vary with the circumstances of the transaction. I am therefore proposing an amendment to the Privacy Act to provide that credit providers may disclose credit information regulated by the Privacy Act&mdash;that is, relating to a borrower's consumer credit worthiness&mdash;to guarantors or would-be guarantors where the borrower has consented to the disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In framing this amendment the Government 2164has been conscious that further consideration is being given to the disclosure of information to guarantors in relation to the implementation of the Martin committee report on banking. Thus, for guarantees entered into after the commencement of the provisions, the Bill does not seek to address what information should be disclosed or when information should be disclosed to guarantors. However, for guarantees in existence at the time of the commencement of these provisions, the amendments would permit disclosure of information to a guarantor where that information is relevant to the guarantor's liability or possible liability under the guarantee and the borrower has been notified that such disclosures to the guarantor may take place in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also amend the Privacy Act 1988 to permit credit providers who have mortgages over the same property to share credit information where the borrower is more than 60 days in default. The Government has received complaints from consumers who have authority to use a partner's account but are not permitted under the Privacy Act to receive information about that account to assist them in making payments and otherwise managing the account. Therefore, to meet these concerns the Bill will permit the disclosure of basic information concerning that account, such as the account balance, the amount of available credit on the account, the minimum payment due and some information about transactions, to the person authorised to operate the account. However, in order to protect the privacy of the account owner, information about the owner's transactions will not be disclosed to that person. Thus, children who are permitted by their parents to use their parent's credit card will not have access to information concerning the parent's credit transactions. </PARA>

<PARA>The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992 will amend a number of Acts under which superannuation benefits are payable to Commonwealth employees and office holders and their spouses and children. The purpose of the amendments is to remove discrimination on the basis of marital status from certain provisions of the superannuation schemes. The removal of discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex and marital status has been identified in the National Agenda for Women as a priority area for Government action. Action has already been taken to review and limit the exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for superannuation and to increase superannuation coverage for women. </PARA>

In more recent times, as the Government has taken steps to extend superannuation coverage in the broader community, we have been committed to that coverage being provided in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The 1991 amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act will oblige private sector employers to limit sex and marital status discrimination in superannuation only to those limited superannuation practices which remain exempt from the Sex Discrimination Act. These amendments, consistent with the Government's commitment to an equitable provision of access to superannuation benefits, will ensure that Commonwealth superannuation is also in conformity with the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation being amended is the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Governor-General Act 1974, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Parliamentary and Judicial Retiring Allowances Act 1973, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976. These amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth's own legislative superannuation schemes are consistent with amendments which were made last year to the Sex Discrimination Act. Those amendments narrowed the previous exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for superannuation so that most forms of discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status in superannuation will be unlawful, subject to a number of limited exemptions relating to particular superannuation practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those amendments come into effect two years from the date on which that legislation received royal assent&mdash;that is, 25 June 1993&mdash;in order to permit the necessary changes to be made to superannuation schemes. This legislation amending the Commonwealth's own legislatively based superannuation schemes will come into effect on the same date as those amendments&mdash;25 June 1993. It will apply to benefits payable as a result of the death of a person on or after that date, while the existing provisions of each of the legislative schemes will continue to apply to benefits which became payable as the result of the death of a person before that date. </PARA>

It is intended that the trust deed and rules will be amended along the lines of the amendments made by this Bill to remove discrimination in the public sector superannuation scheme. Similarly, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 is not being amended by this Bill. However, it is intended that the trust deed and rules made under that Act will also be amended to remove marital status discrimination. It is anticipated that the amendments to both of those trusts deeds and rules will be made prior to 25 June 1993, the date of effect of the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>

Further, some of the schemes discriminate against ex-nuptial children in the allocation of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes will result in some additional costs to Commonwealth superannuation schemes in some situations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Department of Finance has advised that, because most schemes already recognise spouses, including de facto spouses where the relationship has existed for some years or where there is financial dependency, the additional costs would be very small. There is insufficient data on the incidence, rate of formation, duration of, or extent of financial dependency in de facto relationships among members of existing Commonwealth schemes to enable the additional cost or budgetary effect to be estimated with any certainty. Any additional costs would be offset by social security and taxation clawbacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this Bill will apply a standard and non-discriminatory approach to the assessment of eligibility of spouses for reversionary benefits and will remove the provisions which discriminate against ex-nuptial children. The key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse to reversionary benefits under the amended legislation will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides tests for establishing that such a relationship exists: either that the couple were living together as husband and wife for at least three years, or, where the couple were living together as husband and wife for a lesser period of time, that there is other evidence to establish that the relationship was a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. The Bill provides a list of the types of evidence which may be considered, but will not restrict the decision makers to that list alone. The assessment will be made on the basis of all relevant evidence. </PARA>

These strategies include: (a) special `languages other than English programs' in Aboriginal languages for children attending Aboriginal schools; (b) bilingual and bi-cultural programs; (c) measures for Aboriginal languages curriculum development and materials production; and (d) the provision of Aboriginal bilingual language teaching and para-professional staffing resources.

These attitudes form the basis of negative myths, generally based on ignorance or misinformation, which are the foundation of racism and prejudice. These myths are major obstacles in the development of harmonious cross-cultural relations and have had their foundation in the school age education received by most non-Aboriginal Australians. In a very real way, generations of non-Aboriginal Australians were educated to be prejudiced. Through the process of educational and societal change these issues can and will be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of including Aboriginal studies in the curriculum has created an opportunity for change.

The Australian Capital Territory is provided for separately, in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1992-93. These general purpose grants represent the outcome of the 1992 Premiers Conference, the Loan Council meeting on 12 June of this year and, of course, the 1992 Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of general purpose assistance to the States under this Bill is set at $14.092 billion, which represents about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1992-93. This is one of the single largest items in the Commonwealth Budget and it is one of the most important factors in determining the Budgets of the State governments. With these grants, the Government appears to have lived up to its undertaking at the 1990 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of the general revenue assistance in real terms over the three years, 1991-92 to 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has also agreed to a one-off payment of around $166m for 1992 which will not be reflected in the base level of funding for 1993-94 and after. This was chosen by the Premiers over the possibility of a more certain three-year arrangement with the Commonwealth reflecting the straitened financial circumstances in which the States find themselves as a result of the recession imposed upon them and the rest of the country by this Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A working party of State and Commonwealth Treasury officials has been established which is looking into the medium term budgetary outlook for the Commonwealth and the States. This working party will report to the 1993 Premiers Conference on the outcome of its deliberations. This means that this year's Premiers Conference effectively deferred any detailed consideration of Federal-State financial relations until next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heads of Treasuries working party is examining the adequacy of the current scope and methodology of fiscal equalisation and the principles on which it is based. The working party will make recommendations on the complexity and transparency of the current arrangements, the efficiency costs of horizontal fiscal equalisation, and the implications of all this for facilitating structural change throughout Australia. The working party's report will be considered in conjunction with the Grants Commission's major methodology review in 1993, and the studies currently being prepared by the governments of Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the Minister for Health to determine the hospital grants component of the financial assistance grants to be made under this legislation. This is the mechanism by which the Government hopes to bail out Medicare and the financial difficulties faced by its health budget. It should be noted that the coalition State governments are in the process of challenging the formula for the allocation of these grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this Bill follows the provisions of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991, a great deal has changed in the Commonwealth-State relations since that Bill was dealt with. Since then, we have acquired a new Prime Minister, as well as new Premiers in four States and a new Chief Minister in one Territory. We have also seen the scuttling of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke's new federalism initiatives, as a result of the bid of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the top job late last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within days of the State Grants (General Purposes) Bill being debated in the House last year, the honourable member for Blaxland, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), made a speech at the National Press Club in which he played on Caucus fears of an end to the pork-barrelling potential of Commonwealth funding to the States. As we all know, there is nothing Government members like more than unveiling plaques in their electorates for projects supported by Federal funds. One member of the steering committee, when looking at Commonwealth-State financial relations, said that the honourable member for Blaxland's speech had `thrown a dead cat at the financial relations side of our agenda'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what stood then as a renewed commitment to reforming Commonwealth-State relations was blown out of the water by the current Prime Minister's leadership aspirations. A senior State government official also had occasion to remark at the time that `Keating and the Ministers who support him treat us like trogs who can't be trusted with the milk money'&mdash;another touch of our Prime Minister's arrogance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be surprised, then, to find that little progress has been made in reforming Federal-State financial relations since we last debated a States Grants (General Purposes) Bill in this place. The Labor Government's belated commitment to reform of Federal-State relations fell apart under the weight of the leadership struggle within the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. It will, therefore, be some time before we see a major reform of Federal-State relations, and that reform will take place under a coalition rather than a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1990 Federal and State Liberal leaders met and committed themselves to a review of the taxation sources available to the States, in addition to looking at reforms to the grants system to ensure a stable and more broadly based system of funding for the States. The current Prime Minister is a committed centralist. In fact, he is even more of a centralist than many of his Caucus colleagues, which is a fairly remarkable achievement given the propensities of many of those opposite. Given his performance as Commonwealth Treasurer, this commitment to centralism by the now Prime Minister&mdash;particularly fiscal centralism&mdash;is to be expected. It was largely by cutting back on Commonwealth grants to the States that the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister was able to confect a couple of Budget surpluses a few years ago. The Commonwealth shifted the burden of expenditure restraint onto the States, while allowing its own purpose spending to increase significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1982-83 Commonwealth own purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent in real terms compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for Commonwealth payments to the States. The increase in States own purpose outlays has been only 29.1 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is well known for his desire to run everything in sight. It is therefore unlikely that we will see the many problems with Commonwealth-State financial relations being satisfactorily addressed in the near future by this Government. Many countries around the world today are re-examining their federal systems of government in order to improve efficiencies. Some countries, such as the Federal Republic of Germany, already have advanced federal systems that have worked well for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, however, we continue to live with a federal system that has many of the disadvantages and few of the benefits of a federal system of government. We have all the inefficiencies and duplications that are generated by multiple levels of government and complicated tax sharing arrangements, but we have few of the benefits of accountability and responsibility that should flow from having three distinct and competitive levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the federal systems in the world, Australia must have the most centralised system of revenue raising and the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance. This represents a long term historical trend as well as the recent politics of Federal-State financial relations. Proposals to reverse this trend towards fiscal centralisation are invariably undermined by political expediency on the part of both State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the outcome of the 1992 Premiers Conference and the 1992 Commonwealth Budget, the Commonwealth accounts for around 70 per cent of public sector revenue but only 50 per cent of public sector outlays when transfers to other levels of government are excluded. The State Government sector accounts for 27 per cent of public sector revenue and yet is responsible for 45 per cent of total public sector outlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the expenditure and revenue collected by the States is made up by intergovernmental grants such as those provided for in this Bill. These grants have increasingly been used by the Commonwealth to impose its will on the other levels of government. The Federal Labor Government has increasingly tied grants to the States for its own purposes through increases in specific purpose payments at the expense of general revenue assistance grants. Specific purpose payments have increased from 30.4 per cent of total Commonwealth payments to the States in 1982-83 to 41.1 per cent in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of tied grants is likely to increase in the near future rather than decrease. Of course, the States have not been blameless in this process of fiscal centralisation. The States have continually shirked responsibility for raising their own revenue, despite their otherwise legitimate protestations about the inadequacy of the tax base on which they are forced to rely. But the Federal Labor Government's repeal in 1989 of the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act virtually guaranteed that the States would be denied a satisfactory revenue base of their own. The repeal of the Act came just as the Greiner Government in New South Wales was giving serious thought to an income tax rebate under the provisions of that Act for the taxpayers of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no excuse for the Commonwealth repealing the principal piece of legislation that would have enabled the States to assume the taxing responsibilities originally intended for them by the framers of the Constitution. Indeed, there has been no more ridiculous a contribution to the debate about Federal-State financial relations than that spoken by the then Treasurer about double taxation in his second reading speech to the repeal Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the States are now prepared to take up a greater share of the responsibility for raising their own revenue and are prepared to exercise the fiscal discipline that they have long lacked due to the absence of appropriate incentives under excessive levels of fiscal centralisation. The States are presently stuck with an extremely narrow tax base. The narrow tax base available to the States requires high rates of each type of available tax with the result that these taxes are highly distortionary and highly inequitable in their effects. The only major addition to State taxing powers in recent times has been the handing over of the Federal bank account debits tax to the States as a consequence of the Debits Tax Termination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to reform Commonwealth-State financial relations the States are not necessarily looking for new taxes or even extra revenue. Rather they are looking for a guaranteed share of Federal income tax revenue that will enable them to manage their budgets and be held accountable for their spending policies. A State government has little incentive to exercise spending restraint if it is then unable to pass on the benefits of that restraint to taxpayers in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the long expressed views of the current Prime Minister, the States can be trusted to exercise fiscal restraint so long as they can be held responsible by their electors for the raising of the necessary revenue. It is very much a case of the pot calling the kettle black for the Prime Minister to accuse the States of fiscal irresponsibility, given that he has shifted the burden of public sector expenditure restraint onto the States to increase the level of the Commonwealth's own purpose spending. The sharing of such responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States is potentially an effective way of ensuring that public sector spending and taxing is held consistent with national economic priorities. There are a number of mechanisms by which this could be achieved without the States having to levy their own income or other taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fiscal competition between the States has the potential to dramatically lower taxes and discipline State spending policies in a way that the Commonwealth has been unable to achieve under this Government. The current distribution of fiscal powers is already subverting any attempt to run a responsible public sector burrowing requirement. It must also be appreciated that reforming Federal-State financial relations is an essential prerequisite for addressing many of the other issues in Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Ken Wiltshire noted in his paper on cooperative federalism for the Economic Planning and Advisory Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal financial arrangements are the single most significant obstacle to a shake out of inter-governmental duplication. The dominance of the Commonwealth Government in the taxation arena is in many ways the driving force behind its large scale involvement . . . in areas of government activity formerly considered the constitutional preserve of the State and local governments.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have remarked on previous occasions, Federal-State financial relations cannot be addressed in isolation from Federal-State relations more generally and a fundamental examination of the role of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as we address the spending and taxing responsibilities of each level of government it is imperative that we also address the proper extent and role of the public sector in this country. Federalism is not just about administrative arrangements between different levels of government. It is also a theory about how governments can be limited and made accountable by these arrangements. We should examine Federal-State relations in this light. This is something that should be addressed in the course of examining proposals for constitutional reform in the lead up to the centenary of federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Professor Wiltshire also remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very few words indicative of anything resembling criteria for allocation of functions between the levels of government appear in the actual wording of the Constitution.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enhanced Federal system that leads to greater competition between State governments and effective checks on the power of the Commonwealth Executive has the potential to greatly enhance the welfare of the Australian people. It is strange that, while we do not, generally speaking, tolerate monopolies or restrictive practices in the case of business enterprises, we have often acquiesced in the process by which the Commonwealth Government has sought to monopolise the provision of certain goods and services, and eliminated competition between State governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, I want to pick up two comments made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). There are two matters on which we agree. He made the point that these grants are of such magnitude that they have an enormous impact on State governments. It is impossible for a State government to frame its Budget and to determine its priorities, I would argue, without first of all going through the negotiation process, otherwise known as a bun fight, at the Premiers Conference in the middle of the year and at subsequent Loan Council meetings and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me finish the second point that the honourable member was making: that it could be argued that a burden had been shifted onto the States and that they had to take some severe medicine in the last couple of years. I would suggest that it follows that there is not a great deal more efficiency to be had by squeezing the States even further when those grants are to be cut, as the Opposition has promised if it is to reach government. I think I should make some comment about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general agreement that was reached at the Premiers Conference-Loan Council for 1992-93 gave us three outcomes. The first was to maintain the level of general purpose capital grants provided under State government loan council programs at the same nominal level as for 1991-92; and, secondly, to increase the global borrowing limits of the States and Territories by 10 per cent in order to assist in accommodating increased public sector financing needs. It was difficult to get agreement on the third point so, by way of compromise for the 1992-93 period only, it was decided that the base level of the financial assistance grants would be distributed on the basis of the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in accordance with the November 1991 terms of reference for its update of the 1991-92 general revenue grant relativity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate the point on which we agree; that is, the enormous amount of money that is raised by the Commonwealth and then handed on to the States. I would like to indicate the magnitude of the moneys. Budget Paper No. 4 for 1992-93&mdash;and I am referring just to Queensland, my home State&mdash;shows that the per capita Commonwealth payments to Queensland under general revenue were some $908; under general purpose capital, $15; and under specific purpose payments to the States, $632. The total specific purpose payments to Queensland were $944 per capita, and the total payments to Queensland were $1,765 per capita or, rather, that is the estimate for 1992-93. Then in global terms the general revenue assistance to Queensland estimated for 1992-93 is some $2.78 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we agree, I would suggest, that the Commonwealth by and large raises the bulk of the money. I do not think there are any foreshadowed changes of a major degree about to occur, but under present arrangements an enormous amount of money is then dispensed to the States under various formulae, which are agreed, sometimes disagreed, between the Commonwealth and the States at the Premiers Conference, Loan Council, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put the argument in place, let me refer to a proposition that the alternative government is making with respect to those grants to the States; that is, that there would be a 5 per cent cut in financial assistance grants to all States should a coalition government be elected. I want to spell out the various ways in which that cut would be felt in Queensland. In Queensland it would be felt most particularly in employment in the public sector&mdash;remembering also that, if we were to shift jobs out of the public sector, we would of course hope that anyone dismissed from the public sector would be able to pick up a job in the private sector. But I would argue that is most unlikely when, at the same time, a consumption tax is introduced on the private economy, which is meant to suppress expenditure and will therefore make it very difficult to create jobs in the private sector for those people about to be tossed out of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me provide some figures. A 5 per cent cut in the financial assistance grants of the sort that I have already mentioned in Budget Paper No. 4 would mean a cut of $140m per year to Queensland. On top of that there would be a further $150m cut in financial assistance grants, which we understand will mostly go in favour of New South Wales and Victoria, as a result of the impact of the distribution of such grants following the abolition of payroll tax. As I understand it, this means that New South Wales and Victoria gain most through a payroll tax, and if it is to be abolished under the alternative government's proposition there will have to be consequent compensation. That will mean a shift of revenues&mdash;a loss of $150m on top of the $140m to my State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, and just to complete the illustration, there will be a $60m reduction in funds for public housing, a $15m reduction in urban public transport funding, and a $30m cost in the transfer of responsibilities to the States by the Commonwealth in areas such as legal aid, the environment and occupational health and safety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure. There are some consequential changes, but the Opposition will have to come a long way down the track to recoup what is around a $400m loss to the revenue from the Commonwealth to Queensland. In addition, State Government estimates that our better cities program, which comes in under the general purpose capital assistance grants, and is part of this discussion, will cost it $100m in terms of loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the Opposition's argument; that is its ideological position. It wants to force smaller government onto Australia, so it has to take the political consequences. The political consequences are a $400m loss to Queenslanders. For that they will not treat the Opposition kindly. I will tell them every day over the next six months of this Parliament that they will be treated cruelly by the severe cuts in grants to the States, particularly to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cut in these various Commonwealth grants to Queensland under the alternative proposition of around $400m&mdash;the State Treasury estimates that it is $393m&mdash;would have the following sort of impact. I do this by means of illustration because we cannot determine how any State government would create a new budget under this sort of pressure. I would hate to be Keith De Lacy in a year's time, having had $400m cut out of his grants from the Commonwealth, sitting down with his State Ministers and having to knock up a State Budget. This is the sort of thing that he might be forced to do. Either he has to raise more revenue himself from the very narrow revenue base, which is the argument of the honourable member for Curtin, or he has to bite the bullet and take the political consequences of raising taxes. The alternative is to cut services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cutting services means sacking people. When administrative efficiencies are sought, it is hoped to have one person do the job of two. When the point is reached where there are not any more administrative efficiencies to be had&mdash;I suggest that there are not that many more to be had in the governance of the Australian States because we have certainly put them under a little pressure ourselves in the last decade&mdash;and having gone that far and not being able to go any further, the point is passed of the nonsense of seeking administrative efficiencies and one gets into the very heart of programs; one gets into the sacking of skilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A $393m loss per year to Queensland would mean a cut of some 2,400 in police numbers in Queensland. When Wayne Goss came to power in 1989 he promised, under pressure from the entire Queensland community, to increase the number of police in Queensland by 1,200 in his first term. I understand that he has successfully completed that task. In addition to that, the Liberal Party at the last State election just some weeks ago was arguing on its law and order campaign&mdash;which did not go down too well amongst the voters, I might say&mdash;and had also promised to increase by a further 1,200 the number of police in Queensland. So, under this sort of arrangement, we would lose 2,400 police. So all of the Goss gains can be wiped out, the 1,200 police that he has put into place all around my electorate and other electorates in Queensland and, in addition, one can wipe out the 1,200 that the Liberal Opposition in Queensland&mdash;</PARA>

In addition to that, if there is no other way around this other than raising taxes at a State level&mdash;and none of us wants to see that&mdash;2,475 teachers would have to be cut out of the Queensland teaching service which, I might also mention, represents the total number of additional teachers employed by the Goss Government in its first three years, in its first term.

It is not possible to hang on to people and pay them wages when the people who really pay the wages, the Commonwealth, has suddenly withdrawn its funding. The game is over; it is necessary to start sacking people. We figure that there would be in the vicinity of 800 other State employees in danger, people such as welfare workers who are employed by the Department of Family Services and so on. Those are the real consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have a debate writ large about vertical fiscal imbalance, revenue sharing between the Commonwealth and the States, governments seeking efficiencies, and so on. They are all decent elements of a debate. But at the end of the day members of the Opposition should not suggest to us that they are seeking to do any more than save money. They want to save 5 per cent of these grants to the States, which the Queensland Treasurer tells us is the equivalent of almost $400m year on year. Those moneys will not be able to be recouped by any other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are a future set of negotiations between a coalition Government and the States that might introduce different means of revenue sharing or allow the States greater ability to raise taxes on their own behalf, that is fine, that is terrific, but that will be a new set of consequences which will have to be built on this base of $400m less to Queenslanders year on year. It will have to be built on this base of a weaker public sector; it will have to be built on the base of fewer persons employed in the public sector who, I would argue, will not be picked up in the private sector.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have determined through any number of years that there should be a public sector in this country of a decent size because they like the sorts of services that are delivered by public services: police, teachers, nurses, welfare workers, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Liberals ran very hard just a couple of weeks ago on a law and order set of issues in Queensland. They were not kindly repaid by the electorate, principally because of the way they campaigned. I think members of the State Liberal Party introduced a couple of USA Republican persons who advised them. They use the sort of drivel that is used by the Republican Party in the USA. Australians, of course, are far more intelligent and resisted that campaign. But even if the campaign was faulty, the Liberals had run an argument in Queensland which said, `We want to employ 1,200 more police officers in Queensland'. They cannot do it and be mates with their Federal counterparts. Members of the coalition have said, `Not only can you not have the extra 1,200 police; we will also have to chop out the 1,200 police that are already there introduced by the Goss Government over the last three years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to members of the coalition that they will find themselves in enormous conflict with their State counterparts, even with the new Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. He will not like this sort of stuff. When Wayne Goss gets on the radio and starts to spit a little venom at the coalition, he will be doing it not because he is a Labor Premier, but because he is a Premier. It will not matter which side one is on when it comes to a criticism of cutting State grants. Any State Premier will fight tooth and nail to make sure that the income received from the Commonwealth is not reduced, and reduced enormously&mdash;a 5 per cent cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a budget is drawn up, whether it is Commonwealth or State, we all know that 96, 97 or 98 per cent of the money has already been spent. It has already gone in programs, capital and so on. We are only ever talking about the last few per cent when it comes to the introduction of new programs. The Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) would know that; we only get to fiddle at the edges year by year. Over time there will be the opportunity to change the shape of arts in Australia enormously; we know that. Year by year only a couple of new programs can be sought to be introduced because the money is basically locked into existing programs and the salaries that go to pay for people who run the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a severe cut as proposed&mdash;`as promised' were the words the Prime Minister used in Question Time today&mdash;by the Opposition to State grants would mean that all of the flexibility for State governments, when they come to frame their programs and their Budgets in the ensuing few years, would be denied them. Those opposite talk about centralist power. There can be no greater power exercised by the Commonwealth Government than to deny all Australian State governments, at least in the near term, any flexibility whatsoever to determine their own programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not matter whether it was a State Labor or Liberal government or Premier, they would be prickly about this sort of stuff. Those opposite will deny them any ability to produce new programs unless they are prepared to raise taxes in their own right under their existing narrow revenue base or cut enormously a particular set of programs. Those might be programs that support the agricultural sector or rural communities. They might be programs that affect particular regions of a State&mdash;the far north of Queensland or the west of Queensland. They may involve communities where the consideration is based on age, such as young children who are currently receiving before and after school care; children at school. The programs may involve the disabled, older people, or women who seek the care of their children. </PARA>

At the end of the day what will happen is that the electorate at large will kick and scream.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary can interrupt all he likes, but that is what he said. I have to say that I heartily agree. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 is really a Bill which is about the reduction of protection, reducing duties on various items, straightening up one or two other areas, and also fixing some mistakes that the Government has made in previous Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the Bill are as follows. The Bill introduces a free rate of duty for aquarium aerators, transmission shafts, cranks for outboard motors and master recording blanks. It inserts a new tariff split and a free rate of duty for books for games under tariff subheading 9504. That corrects an anomaly which has existed since the implementation of the legislation in 1991. It reduces the duty rate on aviation gasoline by one cent per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 implements changes to the Government's initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers; it abolishes quota restrictions on parts of footwear and replaces them with a reduced tariff at 10 per cent. In effect, this changes the arrangements for footwear manufacturers. There are other aspects of this item in other parts of the Bill which make it cheaper for Australian manufacturers to produce footwear. In other words, it reduces the input costs of these manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, it does the same sort of thing in the area of food processing and packaging by allowing duty free imports of goods designed for use in that sector of the food processing and food packaging industries, and also in metal, materials and goods for metal use in the food packaging industry. So the duties are brought down in those areas to reduce the input costs for those manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important aspect of this Bill. We support that general thrust, as we have supported, one might say in an almost bipartisan way, the general thrust of this Government over a number of years in the reduction of protection. We do not support it for any philosophical reason, but for a dollar reason because other people somewhere in Australia have to pay these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two very good examples in this Bill of an initiative brought about by this Government to reduce the cost to manufacturers. It is therefore dishonest of the Government, through the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to get up here day after day to say that this Government is the only government that has ever promulgated a reduction of protection in this country. It is dishonest of him to take pride in that, to pat himself on the back for doing that, but in the same breath to claim that the Opposition's protection policies will destroy this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that since this country realised the cost of the protective measures that it has brought upon itself for 90 years now at least, and since the explanations and understanding of those costs have been taken up by the Australian population in general, there has been a more or less bipartisan approach to these reductions. When the Prime Minister says that he takes credit for all this, I remember well some circumstances in 1984 when he was getting some lessons on the cost of protection in some of the agricultural industries, some of which, as I have said before, had been trying to educate both sides of this House for many years before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will remember the very great cost put upon our primary industries by protective measures in the past. It is interesting to note that the latest work commissioned by the Manufacturing Council of Australia shows that the greatest beneficiaries of a reduction in tariff protection would be manufacturing exporters. I think the Council was quite surprised to find that it was not agricultural exporters or mineral exporters or mineral processors, but that manufacturing exporters would be the greatest beneficiaries of the removal of protection in Australia. In other words, the cost of tariffs is being borne by someone else, and that is a very good example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also extends the quota restrictions applying to certain other cheese by omitting the sunset clause which would have terminated the quota restrictions from 30 June 1992. In 1985 this country was beset&mdash;besieged is probably a better word&mdash;by the importation of a great quantity of two particular types of European cheese, Edam and Gouda. The importation of those cheeses was getting to such an enormous extent that the Government decided that it had to do something about it. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, went to Brussels and negotiated, amongst other things, the Andriessen agreement, which was an agreement by the Europeans to restrict the export of beef to Japan from their subsidised stockpiles of beef, which I am happy to say is still in existence, and also this tariff quota arrangement for cheese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not object to the perpetuation of this arrangement, but I must say that it does seem to us that the industry itself, although it has had some problems in contemplating this issue, would be much better off to run a countervailing duty action against the Europeans over this commodity. Prior to such a hearing, there is absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind that the Europeans subsidise this commodity in its production. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that the Europeans subsidise this commodity in its export. At the same time, whilst we allow some 11,500 tonnes of cheese from Europe into this country, the Europeans restrict our imports into that vast area to 3,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem to us that were the countervailing duty arrangements more expeditious&mdash;in other words were people able to feel that they could run a countervailing duty case in a reasonable time, at reasonable cost, and moreover with some chance that the material injury that they showed did not have to be too great, but that at least having shown it they could get some reasonable reward or countervailing duty in place&mdash;I think the industry could well be better served than it is by the current arrangements. After all, they are quite uneven. It is an understatement to say that our being allowed 3,000 tonnes of cheese into Europe and the Europeans being allowed 11,500 tonnes in here is uneven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having discussed it with the industry on a number of different occasions, I do know that it is nervous about running such an action because it is not sure what the results would be. I also know that it is worried about the evidential procedures and that the fact that it had agreed previously to this sort of arrangement might do it harm in the hearing itself. But I put forward the proposition that, if we could get a preliminary hearing over and done with in 65 days, and where injury is shown some penalties put in place&mdash;as opposed to the current arrangements in which, quite frankly we have to show rather more injury than one would have thought necessary&mdash;I put it to the House that the industry's confidence would be more towards running a countervailing duty case. If that were done, we do not know what the result would be, but it is reasonable to assume that some penalty would be put in place which would bring things to a more even result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at that meeting in Brussels&mdash;not at the negotiations, but at the meeting. That was seven years ago, times have probably changed and we and the industry should be looking at other ways of dealing with it. This perpetuates an uneven arrangement which I think probably should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also imposes an additional duty of $5 per kilogram on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products. In other words, this is one circumstance where the duties will go up. There is no doubt that we should agree. The justification for this was no doubt based on grounds with which one could not disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 of this Bill restructures many of the tariff subheadings which cover textiles, clothing and footwear articles. There are no changes of duty involved; it will merely simplify the classification of goods under these chapters. There are various other changes and reductions, including, of course, a reduction in the rate of duty on imported beer. I do not imagine that anybody in this House would object to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are not world shattering. The Budget effect is minimal and the increase in duty on the imported manufactured tobacco and tobacco products is expected to raise an additional just under $6m in customs duty. The changes to the arrangements on footwear parts from 1 July 1992 are expected to involve a loss of revenue of about $4m per annum. So the financial implications are not great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the proposed amendments in this Bill are uncontentious. The changes under schedule 4 also allow for the duty free importation of goods designed for use in food processing and food packaging industries. As I said earlier, it is an indication that the Government concedes that tariffs are pushing up costs. It can be nothing else; otherwise why would it reduce them? That is simply the point that I wish to make again because it is very important in this debate that it is understood that both sides of this House have set about a policy of reducing protection in Australia for one purpose only, which is to open up Australia to the rigours of international competition, to the rigours of having to address, if you like, best practice in whatever area of manufacturing or business. That best practice will apply equally to the industrial relations area as to protection reduction. So, given that many of the changes in this Bill are either non-contentious or represent an improvement, we do not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act of 1987. Many of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. As has already been said by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), amendments in this legislation concern the tobacco industry, the dairy industry, the aviation industry, the Australian footwear industry, tariff preference arrangements for developing countries and the Florence agreement to which Australia is a signatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the honourable member for Barker said, the amendments contained in this Bill reflect the radical difference between the Government and the Opposition on the very important tariff issue. The Opposition wants to drop tariffs to zero in Australia, giving industries no protection as they restructure to become more efficient. Despite what people such as Senator O'Chee might say on the tariff issue when they go around rural Australia, the bottom line is that the coalition's policy is indeed one of zero tariffs. In contrast to this, the Government is reducing tariffs gradually in full consultation with business, and will maintain moderate tariffs for industries that need them&mdash;for example, 25 per cent for clothing and 15 per cent for cars in the year 2000. Of course, the Government is also providing support for restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On tariff policy this Government and the coalition are very different. The Government is not abolishing tariffs; amendments contained in this Bill make that very clear. Some industries such as the dairy industry or the sugar industry will need continued support and protection, and this Labor Government will give it to them. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and indeed the honourable member for Barker would not do that. The Opposition is committed to zero tariffs across the board. In a debate on this issue on 31 March 1992 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In no other country in the world&mdash;not in Margaret Thatcher's England&mdash;has there been a policy of zero industry protection. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No country in the developed world lacks a policy for protecting its motor vehicle and textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contrast between the Government and the coalition position is indeed clear. The Government is phasing tariffs down to 25 per cent for the clothing industry, 15 per cent for textiles, 15 per cent for cars and 5 per cent for most other industries. The coalition proposes a zero tariff regime for everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three industries affected by the Bill are particularly relevant to my electorate and I will direct my comments therefore to the effect of this legislation on the tobacco industry, the dairy industry and the aviation and related tourism industry. The first aspect of this legislation that I want to talk about concerns the tobacco industry. Schedule 5, which was operative from 19 August 1992, increases the duty on certain tobacco products by $5 a kilogram, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are a lot of tobacco growers in my electorate and they are understandably concerned about the long term effect of State and Federal government increases in excise levels. They are also understandably more concerned about the coalition's plans for the tobacco industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, at page 83, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in the Health Policy (Supplementary Paper No 3) the Liberal and National parties will increase the excise on tobacco by 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of consultation with the industry or even acknowledgment that this policy may adversely affect farmers who happen to grow tobacco. Whether we like it or not, tobacco is a legal product. It seems to me that the Opposition is intent on punishing tobacco growers who are looking at certain economic ruin should the coalition ever form a government. With a 15 per cent GST on top of its 25 per cent excise, some cigarette packets would cost over the $5 mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to use this opportunity to remind the House that, whilst I share the concerns of my colleagues about the health risks associated with tobacco smoking, there are hundreds of hardworking farmers in the Mareeba and Dimbulah area of my electorate who came out to Australia many years ago from Europe and were encouraged to plant tobacco leaf and invest in irrigation systems and drying sheds. They have invested their life's labour in a legal product and are now being made to feel somewhat like criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this House before, and I repeat it, that smoking is a dangerous habit and I support the Government's effort to reduce the number of smokers in the community and lessen the dreadful burden of tobacco-related deaths on the health system. However, where paternalistic policy measures such as tobacco advertising bans or increases in tobacco excise such as in this Bill directly affect the viability of farmers, I believe that it is incumbent on the Government to provide appropriate compensation or a crop substitution scheme for those farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we do not have to go as far as a complete ban to justify the provision of a compensation deal or alternative crop assistance for tobacco farmers. What we now have is a deliberate Government policy to minimise tobacco consumption which directly affects the viability of the tobacco industry. To put it in context, we have a quota system for tobacco growers and that quota system is based on the previous year's consumption. So if fewer people in Australia smoke in a particular year due to Government policies, tobacco growers are able to grow less of that product. Of course, the more we have policies to ensure that there is less consumption in this country, the less viable tobacco farmers will become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Government has responded to my concerns. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) announced last month that he would establish a tobacco industry task force to look at a national approach to the future development of the tobacco industry. Grower representatives from New South Wales and Victoria have joined with the Queensland body and have taken up an offer made by the Minister to Mareeba growers in July this year to work with the industry to develop a growth strategy in light of public policy concerns in relation to tobacco. Under this approach the task force, involving representatives of growers and manufacturers, will examine the prospects for the industry, including the export of Australian tobacco leaf and tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to establish the task force, I believe, is a further demonstration of the Government's preparedness to work with the industry. It shows up yet again one of the big differences between this Government and the Opposition. We believe in consultation and listening to people. The Opposition&mdash;and I am sure the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) would concur with me&mdash;believes in whatever the economic rationalists in its right wing think-tanks tell it to believe in. This is clearly illustrated in relation to the process of consultation with the dairy industry on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also extends quota restrictions on certain types of cheese. This extension is the result of an intense and successful consultative effort between the Government and the dairy industry. The amendments in this Bill concerning the dairy industry have been welcomed by the industry. Why? Because this Bill retains the cheese quota, which is exactly what the industry wanted. The dairy plan has been well received by the dairy industry. It is proof that the Primary Industries Minister is not going to be driven solely by the dictates of Industry Commission reports. Again this is in stark contrast to the Opposition, which has a stated policy of fully implementing the recommendations of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990, the Industry Commission was given a reference to inquire into the Australian dairy industry. With respect to the cheese quota, the Commission recommended that the quota not be renewed, much to the horror of the dairy industry. In typical fashion, the Industry Commission concluded that, while the quota limited imports from most sources to an arbitrary level, it did so without any of the assessments that accompany anti-dumping actions. This, according to the Commission, enabled manufacturers to increase their profitability by limiting competition in the market at the expense of consumers who are denied access to cheese at lower prices. Part of that may be true, but we have one of the most efficient dairy industries in the world&mdash;an industry that is competing in a radically distorted international marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much to the relief of the dairy industry, the Government adopted a cooperative, consultative approach to developing a plan for the future of the dairy industry. After wide consultation with the industry on 30 April the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced a new framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements. A key element of the arrangements, to which this Bill will give effect, was the retention of the cheese quota. I might say that Pat Rowley from the dairy industry actually came down to Canberra to meet members of the Caucus primary industries and energy committee after the Minister made this announcement. He made it quite clear that he was extremely pleased with the way the Government had cooperated and consulted with his industry. Although he did not say it in so many words, he made it quite clear that such a consultative approach may well not have been forthcoming had a different government been in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful outcome in the dairy industry bodes well for the sugar industry as the sugar industry task force, which is headed by my capable colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), is currently involved in consultations with cane farmers, sugar millers, sugar mills and people working in that industry up and down the sugar belt of this country. The cooperative approach is in marked contrast to the coalition's ideological approach to driving tariffs down to zero without any regard for the individual circumstances of our industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also confused about tariffs. Some National Party members&mdash;I cited Senator O'Chee earlier&mdash;strongly support slower tariff reductions, or no tariff reductions, and indeed the retention of some tariff protection. Well, that is what they say when they are out in rural Australia, particularly rural Queensland. Even some Liberal members disagree with the Leader of the Opposition. I quote from a recently publicised statement by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) who said in this House not too long ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem that Australia's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the fact is that, despite the crocodile tears of some National Party and Liberal Party members who claim to be against zero tariffs, they are irrevocably bound to implement them. The Leader of the Opposition has made it very clear that he will not budge from his commitment to zero tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final aspect of this legislation that I want to talk about relates to schedule 3 of this Bill, which reduces the customs duty on aviation gas by 1.1c per litre. This customs duty is charged on avgas, which is exclusively used by piston-engine aircraft. This Government has progressively reduced this particular excise. The funds collected go to the Civil Aviation Authority to fund its various operations around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that jet aircraft and turbo-prop aircraft, which service most of the tourist routes in Australia, run on excise-free avtur, not avgas. The reduction in the avgas excise results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in CAA costs of providing rescue and firefighting services at airports. The reduction in the avgas excise will be welcomed by small aircraft owners and charter companies in my electorate, who are extremely fearful of the Opposition's plans for their industry. While the Opposition says that it will eliminate the excise, it has not said how it will alternatively fund the CAA. It has said, however, that it will introduce a 100 per cent user-pays safety levy. I have received many letters from aircraft owners and charter companies in my electorate expressing their fears that they will be hit with massive registration levies to cover the costs of CAA services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the reduction in the avgas excise results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in CAA costs of providing rescue and firefighting services at airports. The number of aerodromes owned by the Commonwealth or under the aerodrome local ownership plan has been reduced to fewer than one hundred. This has enabled the Government to pass on the fuel reduction of 1.1c per litre. There will be a further reduction next year as more airports are phased out of the ALOP scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, it might interest you to know that in the past 18 months I have handed over 15 cheques totalling $6,444,696 to local councils in my electorate. That process has involved the transfer of ownership of the aerodromes concerned from the Commonwealth to local councils. In total, 27 airports in my electorate have received $8,594,787. </PARA>

If he has a look at the State figures for his seat of Ballarat, he will see that he might not be with us after the next election. As I said, the transfer of ownership of local airports is intended to bring about a more efficient service as local communities are more aware of needs of their local airports. I take this opportunity to mention the fact that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) will be in Longreach next week to hand over a $3.8m cheque to the Longreach Shire Council to assist that Council in taking over the management of its airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Longreach Airport is critical to the future of the blossoming tourist industry in north-west Queensland.

Thousands of tourists are deliberately setting out across the country to visit the Stockman's Hall of Fame and other outback attractions such as the Blackall Wool Scour and the Barcaldine Workers Heritage Centre. At both those latter tourist destinations last weekend, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was welcomed with open arms and was certainly treated to a great day. Barcaldine and Blackall are very historic towns as far as the history of the Labor movement is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that if the Opposition had its way it would wreak havoc in the tourist industry. The plans of the Leader of the Opposition would cost domestic airlines more than $250m a year, even after allowing for supposed tax offsets such as payroll tax abolition, petrol tax abolition and wholesale sales tax abolition. This cost would inevitably be passed on to passengers, and Treasury estimates that air fares would increase by over 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition claims that the elimination of excise on aviation fuel or avtur would bring air fares down. As you would note, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is simply wrong. The Government removed the excise from avtur fuel five years ago. In October 1991, the Opposition tourism spokesperson, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask you, is it fair if you apply GST to a loaf of bread and you don't apply it to a holiday in Hawaii?</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, he has decided that it is fair, because the GST would not affect international air fares but, as we all know, would certainly have a devastating effect on the price of the necessities of life, including bread. International air fares would be zero rated under Fightback, but domestic air fares would not. In other words, families who can afford to fly to Hawaii for a holiday would not pay the GST, but families who wanted to travel from Brisbane to Longreach to visit the Stockman's Hall of Fame would. Clearly, the Opposition's Fightback proposal is anti-tourism and therefore anti-outback Queensland. If the coalition had its way, the GST would kill off the tourist industry as people headed for cheaper Asian destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry would collapse in the face of zero tariffs; the sugar would collapse in the face of zero tariffs; and the tobacco industry would be wiped out completely. Towns such as Mareeba and Dimbulah would become ghost towns as a result of Fightback's increased excise in relation to tobacco and, on top of that, the GST slug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, I believe that the amendments in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill currently before the House are proof of the Government's commitment to phased tariff reduction and industry restructuring in an atmosphere of consultation. While the honourable member for Ballarat is in the House, he might do well to note the fact that out in rural Queensland&mdash;and he has a rural based seat in Victoria&mdash;people are not wearing the GST proposal.

In the 1980s a whole group of so-called entrepreneurs built their phoney empires on paper shuffling, by acquiring fake asset valuation and by meaningless paperwork. Australia now has a taxation system which punishes the thrifty and taxes personal savings at the marginal rate.

Apart from having created one of the most hostile business environments in the world, Australia has some of the most complicated tax and business laws in the developed world, yet we do not even have an industry policy. Everything is secondary to having the correct government form filled out on the right day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our enterprises become fewer and fewer, the attack from the bureaucracy will become more and more concerted and relentless.

The sad thing is that, when people go into a store and buy a shirt, they do not really know what protection they are getting from it.

Very fine T-shirts will not hold up. The rule of thumb, for anyone who wants to know, is to hold it up to the light. That will show the amount of ultraviolet radiation that is getting through.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, the Government has given notice that it regards compulsion as the way to go with superannuation, especially where employers are concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disastrous consequences on employment have been discussed by bodies such as the former Confederation of Australian Industry. It has come up with a figure of some 80,000 jobs which will be either lost or not created as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. The Government has not heeded the calls for a more sensible retirement incomes policy that gives tax incentives for people to invest in superannuation whilst at the same time ensuring that the prevalence of double dipping is either eliminated or greatly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Hewson government will raise the preservation age from the present level of 55 years to 60 years over a 10-year period from July 1994. This will ensure that superannuation is used for its originally intended purpose&mdash;the funding of one's retirement&mdash;and not as an easy way to have access to a sizeable sum of money at 55 and then to rearrange one's affairs onto a taxpayer funded pension at a later date. There should always be a link between employer and employee contributions. I have been a very strong advocate of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government compels employers to pay a minimum amount as a superannuation contribution. There is little incentive for employees to contribute additional amounts to superannuation. Under the changes from 1 July 1992, if one is an employee who receives only employer superannuation contributions under an industrial award, one can receive only a 10 per cent rebate on the first $1,000 of contributions. Where is the incentive to contribute to a personal superannuation fund under these arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At other times, the Keating Government's superannuation policy and its failure to focus on tax incentives have further unfortunate consequences. The example of South Australia's public sector, where one-third of the employees have not taken the action necessary to join their public sector scheme, shows how complacent individuals can be about financial planning for retirement when a government fails to emphasise the link between employer and employee contribution levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In advocating compulsion as the way to go for superannuation, the Government has shown how unsure it is of itself by commissioning some market research at a cost of $98,000 in April 1992. The study of Brian Sweeney and Associates was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Community Education Campaign on Benefit of Saving for Retirement Through Superannuation</EMPHASIS>. The Government has been spending many thousands of dollars advertising the superannuation guarantee charge, but this report suggests that much of the spending may be unnecessary. The report indicates that, in April 1992, 93 per cent of full time wage and salary earners were having their employer superannuation contributions paid into the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over half of part time workers were similarly covered. Many of those not receiving the 3 per cent would be earning less than the $450 minimum monthly earnings, a figure that now brings an employee within the ambit of the levy. Of course, this back flip to a higher figure of $450 on 16 June 1992 shows just how little idea the Government has regarding the impact of its policies out in Australian workplaces. The Government is now spending thousands of dollars in targeting members of the public with advertising about the SGC when the professionals that the majority of people rely on for information&mdash;such as accountants, superannuation funds, insurance companies and financial advisers&mdash;are already well informed about the whole concept of superannuation. In talking about a similar study regarding the extent of awareness of the tax file number rules, Senator McMullan suggested that understanding of these rules was very high when he said on 28 May 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . up to 93 per cent of respondents are able to correctly answer questions on the rules of the tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we take the same approach with the SGC, there seems to be little need for this advertising and the $98,000 market research study. The Government's whole approach to superannuation is flawed. It has emphasised compulsion and that only one group&mdash;the employers&mdash;are to shoulder the major part of the burden in shifting Australians away from dependence on the social welfare system. This Government has wasted $100,000 in market research on people's attitudes to superannuation, when all along the Government's approach was known to be one of forcing an inflexible arrangement on unwilling and recession-hit employers whilst ultimately failing to lift Australia's savings ratio. </PARA>

I make the observation that a lot of money is being pushed into organisations such as Troubleshooters to try to break down award conditions and to create industrial disputations in the shearing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to hear over and over again speeches from the other side of the House by people who want to attack award conditions&mdash;conditions that create a civilised society and create a little bit of dignity for working men and women in this country. In the Charleville area Dudley Watson has been successful on 47 different occasions on various properties in catching people for breaches of the award and thousands of dollars have been collected on behalf of workers as a result of the underpayment of wages. This has been done by the Australian Workers Union and it will continue to do so. The union will not be intimidated by thugs like Graeme Haycroft who runs Troubleshooters and who was a former supporter of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in his `Joh for PM' campaign and the New Right stemming out of the H.R. Nicholls Society in Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most people have read about Bender's Quarry in Tasmania. Ray Bender decided to take the Government on about the closure of his quarry in the Huon Valley in Tasmania. By the way, I have been trying to get a question up here for a long time. It is difficult to do so when one has something important to say and wants to bring forward the aspirations of somebody in one's electorate. One gets a bit frustrated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to the debates all week about the Catholics, the Uniting Church, and what the GST will do to the poor people and so on. I thought to myself, `Boy, if income isn't generated somewhere, somebody has to look after the poor and the needy'. So we seem to be arguing the toss about what is right and what is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden down in the Huon we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). They tell me that she supports the Raiders; I often see her in a green uniform and they say that she is a green raider or something or other. When she was appointed Minister for the Environment, I held my breath because I remember vividly her reaction on, first, the Franklin River and, second, on the pulp mill in Tasmania. Her reaction was all pro-greenie. I thought to myself, `We are in for trouble in Tasmania', because if ever a State has been ruined by the greenies, it is Tasmania. It has been absolutely ruined. We have unemployment everywhere, with people battling to pay their bills, as I have said ad infinitum in this House. So how the dickens can they pay for the poor and needy when they cannot even get jobs themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden the Minster decided to close this quarry in Tasmania on the whim and fancy of the greenies. The quarry has been operating for 43 years, supplying jobs to five families in the area. It also had a generating effect through creating jobs for the primary producers and so on. All of a sudden she decided to close it. But she picked the wrong bloke. I like a bloke with a bit of tenacity who will have a bit of a go. Ray Bender is one of those people. He would have made a dashed good politician. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useless the Labor candidate who is running against me trying to knock me off my perch. Everybody tries to knock me off my perch. The Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, would laugh at that remark. Here we have another one trying to knock me off my perch, playing the dual role, saying, `Look, they are wrong, but I will do my best for you'. Let us face the facts: the Labor Party in Tasmania is in bed with the greenies, as we all know. So when they are saying that they are going to save the quarry, all they are saying is, `Look, vote for us. Give us a chance, and we will play both sides of fence'. But they picked the wrong bloke with Ray Bender, who is a solid Tasmanian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray Bender has been there for many years, providing opportunities for people in Tasmania who could not get jobs anywhere else. Not everybody has had a university education: some people have to work with their hands. Some people have to provide for their families with the strength of their arms and hands. But he provided jobs for them. I am sorry that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories is not here. I do not like attacking her because she is probably a decent woman. But I remember that, the day after the Budget, she was photographed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in front of the palatial building that was going to be built for the public servants here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said about Canberra on many occasions, Canberrans do not know that they are alive. They are very decent people, but most of them have two jobs and have everything going for them.

Here we have a woman dictating the terms from Canberra when she would not have a clue what it is like to really work hard and try to provide jobs for ordinary people. When I saw that photograph, I thought, `Alas, I have to put up with the green machine again for another couple of years'. The people in Tasmania, the ordinary people who understand what is happening, are a wake-up to her, and they have tabbed her correctly as a greenie. Regrettably, she has closed that cave, and she has closed it on the whim and fancy of the greenies of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak about an industry of great importance to Australia and to my electorate of Parramatta, and that is the tourism industry. Tourism has been one of the real success stories of recent times. It has developed as an industry which today is one of Australia's great success stories. It is now our single biggest export earner. Between 12 and 16 per cent of all jobs created in Australia this decade will be in the tourism industry. This year we expect to have about 2.4 million visitors come to Australia as part of the continuing growth and promotion of Australian tourism overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to the Australian tourism industry has been highlighted in a number of recent initiatives, including the measures in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February. Some of the initiatives the Government has taken in relation to tourism include the depreciation allowance change, the changes to provide more funding for the Australian Tourist Commission to promote Australia overseas, the additional funding that has been related to the development of the national tourism industry strategy, and the measures that have been taken to ensure that the infrastructure associated with the tourism industry can be expanded and developed. Apart from all those things, there have been the changes in aviation and other areas that have helped to highlight Australia's increasing tourism potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In electorates such as Parramatta we have had increasing consciousness of tourism. A number of outstanding successes have been achieved. Because of its history, Parramatta has some of Australia's very important heritage properties with great tourism potential. We have the oldest existing colonial cottage in Australia, Elizabeth Farm Cottage, Old Government House, and the oldest agricultural building in Australia, the Governor's Dairy in Parramatta Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry in my electorate is becoming increasingly important. The priority that the local community accords the tourism industry and its employment potential is highlighted by a couple of points: first, Parramatta today has six international standard hotels and a large amount of other tourist infrastructure in the region, and it is now the gateway to the Blue Mountains, one of Australia's very important tourist destinations. Over 1,000 people are directly employed in the tourism and hospitality industries in my electorate, and many others are employed in social services associated with those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority that the Labor Government has given to creating jobs in the local tourism industry is reinforced by the funding provided for the national heritage projects in the One Nation statement and the local capital works program in the Budget. In the local capital works program, initiatives have been taken to ensure that a new tourist information centre is built in Parramatta and to restore the Governor's Dairy as a museum. These projects are an important recognition of tourism at a local level and of its place in the development of national industry and infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that imperils the growth of a great industry such as Australia's tourism industry is the policy of the Liberal and National parties. The goods and services tax in the Fightback package has no more devastating effect than on an industry such as tourism. It will have an impact on entertainment facilities. The riverside theatres at Parramatta would be severely affected. The local restaurants, bowling clubs and so forth would be directly and severely affected by the impact of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange thing about this Fightback proposal is that it takes away from what the promotion of domestic tourism encourages. Indeed, one has to ask why, when we are trying to encourage the development of a home-grown tourism industry, would we want to create an environment in which we make international holidays more attractive than the domestic product? Why are we not encouraging people from regional New South Wales to come to Sydney and the Blue Mountains, perhaps on the regional airline Hazelton Airlines? Why would we say to them, `You are better off going to Disneyland for a holiday than coming to western Sydney and going to Australia's Wonderland?'. Why would a political party propose that sort of policy? Why would we have a goods and services tax proposal which directly attacks the sorts of services that tourism provides? If ever there was a tax that was directly on employment in a growth industry, it is the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electorates such as Parramatta rely increasingly on the growth of tourism, particularly the jobs, the training initiatives and the opportunities it gives to young people. The reliance on that industry is imperilled by this goods and services tax. That is why we see at Question Time that the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) is under such duress when he sees what is happening. Tourism, one of Australia's great jewels in the crown as far as industry development is concerned, is being savaged. Domestic tourism is being savaged by the Opposition. One has to ask: why do we have that sort of policy? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953, specifically section 135A, provide that information about a person or an individual nursing home acquired in the performance of duties or functions under the Act cannot be divulged to a third person. Consistent with this provision, I will answer the question by reference to statistical or general information rather than information specific to individual nursing homes or, indeed, information which might reasonably enable the identification of individual nursing homes or persons concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Audits of nursing homes have identified the following amounts of over-advanced or misapplied Commonwealth benefit paid in respect of the following years:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">for 1988-89, $3,388,021;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Nursing Homes Financial Principles made under subsection 40AA(7) of the Act provide that, where an amount of over-advanced or misapplied benefit is identified, the amount is to be taken into account in determining the home's approved daily fee as a temporary offset to the fee. This effectively provides an offset to the benefit payable each month and, over a specified period, enables recovery of the misapplied funding. This offset to the fee is known as a "negative loading".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Department has a discretion in relation to the period of time over which a loading will be applied, i.e. the period over which the misapplied funding will be recovered, it is incumbent on the Department to recover as soon as is practicable (the recovery period has been of some interest to the Australian National Audit Office). It is Departmental policy to recover over no more than twelve months. However, in cases where a proprietor demonstrates, to the Department's satisfaction, severe financial difficulty, that period may be extended to reduce the impact on the home's cashflow and viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While negative loading is the method for recovery prescribed by the Principles, where misapplied funding is attributable to fraud on the part of the proprietor or funding has been advanced in respect of a period when the proprietor no longer ran the home, it is open to the Commonwealth to pursue the proprietor directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There have been two occasions on which the Department has determined a lesser loading than might otherwise have been determined. In one case, the nursing home was in such extreme financial difficulty that application of the total loading would have precipitated closure of the home and a traumatic dislocation for the residents. The Department acted in response to what was perceived as an immediate threat to the welfare and safety of the frail, aged residents and, in doing so, ensured the maximum return to the Commonwealth in difficult and unique circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other case, the imminent purchaser of a nursing home was given misleading advice by a Departmental officer, on whose advice it was reasonable for that person to rely.
