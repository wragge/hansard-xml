<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the macro-economic front&mdash;the front that matters most to employment, GDP, job creation and wealth&mdash;the Government, through the successful prosecution of its fight against inflation, was able to see interest rates decline by one per cent. In those ensuing two weeks we have had quite a deal of response to the confirmation of lower inflation in the economy as a result of that inflation and the interest rate numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the best manifestation of this was the Westpac Bank's writing off $2.6 billion of losses, writing off the 1980s' inflation fetish, writing off the economy as the largest trading bank&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where did the high inflation come from? From 20 years of you! Writing away the inflation fetish of Australians, of Australian investment, of the fetish with inflation, of the fascination with inflation, not mooning around with a property book waiting for property to lift under another inflationary cycle, Westpac, to its credit, said, `It is over. We are cutting the 1980s out. We are not going to have the bank's profits compromised by continual write-offs. We are not mooning around waiting for inflation to pick up. We believe the Government, that long term inflation is down'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This of course was reiterated by the Deputy Governor of the central bank&mdash;he was attacked for it by the Leader of the Opposition a couple of days later&mdash;when he said that inflation is now at 2 1/2 to 3 per cent and could be sustained. That has certainly been the view of Westpac; it is certainly the view of the business community. The low inflation outcome which we have seen and the interest rates which have attended it, and the announcement by the Treasurer and the Governor of the central bank for a further one per cent reduction in interest rates, bring interest rates to 6.6 per cent for 90-day bills and of that order for 180-day bills, which are the lowest interest rates since the 1960s.</PARA>

The fact is that we are now laying the basis for a long term low inflationary recovery in the 1990s. Nothing has brought this more into evidence than the low inflation rate and the interest rates which are now attending it, the structural decline in the current account deficit and the improvement in the current account beyond the Budget forecast.

<TITLE>Inflation: Value of Savings</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="2724" SPEAKER="Lavarch Mr M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FISHER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer familiar with the argument that rising prices rob people of their savings and also discourage savings? Can the Treasurer provide the House with any recent statistics on this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2724" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am familiar with the argument and so too, apparently, is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On 15 May last year he said in this House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also indisputable that the economic and social costs of high inflation are very great. . . . It robs people of their savings. It discourages savings. It is theft.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It discourages productive investment. . . It distorts investment patterns.</PARA>
<PARA>You would think that, if that were his true view about inflation, he would be applauding the fact that the Government had been able to produce consumer price index growth in March of zero, and a rate for the 12 months up until March of just l.7 per cent, with the underlying rate estimated by Treasury of 3 per cent and falling. You would think that the Opposition would be applauding this. You would think it would be congratulating the Government on ending inflation's robbery of people's savings and congratulating the Government for encouraging savings and encouraging a productive pattern of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Opposition is doing two things: it is blackguarding anyone in an official position, particularly the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, for making the simple observation that inflation has come down and can stay down. Anyone who makes that observation is worthy of nothing but a scurrilous attack from the Opposition. The second thing is that members of the Opposition are about sparking a new surge in inflation in Australia, because their policies are about deliberately aggravating inflation and deliberately increasing the average price level by 4.7 per cent; that is, in their own terms, they would rob every Australian of 4.7 per cent of the value of their savings. It would, in that sense, be a tax on wealth, an arbitrary confiscation of 4.7 per cent of the money in every pensioner's bank account, every young person's building society account and every child's piggy bank. You would not even be safe by taking on board the advice of the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, when he said, `Put your money under the bed'. It would not even be safe there, because the Opposition's theft, the Opposition's inflation, would  not  save  your money  under  your bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this would only be the first instalment because, as Australians know all too well, once the inflation genie is out of the bottle it takes a very long time to wring it out of the economy again. Members of the Opposition claim to have a compensation package which would deal with all of the shortcomings of their inflation inducing policy. But it is full of holes. It is full, first of all, of that big $6 billion hole, which means that they cannot even fund the proposed compensation package. But, even if they could, it applies only to those who are 60 years of age or over in 1994; it applies only to money which earned interest in 1992-93; and, in order to qualify for full compensation, you need to have an annual income of below $20,000 in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are 59 years or under in 1994, the Opposition will rob you of 5 per cent of your hard-earned savings and give you nothing back. There is nothing in the wealth compensation package for you if you are under 60 in 1994.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us imagine someone who sold his house in late 1993 or got a superannuation pay-out or a life insurance policy paid out at that time. Again, the Opposition says, `Tough. We will confiscate 5 per cent of the value of whatever you receive'. In other words, 5 per cent just goes up in smoke. What if you retire in the middle of 1994, having earned anything more than about three-quarters of average weekly earnings in 1993-94? Again, the Opposition would say, `Tough' to you because you would have fallen through one of the many holes that exist in the wealth compensation package proposed by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are one of the aged pensioners who actually qualify for the compensation package, you would have to fill out forms and wait until they are processed just to get back the money that the coalition has robbed you of. The Leader of the Opposition was quite correct last year when he said that increasing prices and increasing inflation is theft. That means that Fightback is theft.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that we have witnessed a structural reduction in inflation. The implications of this for economic recovery are profound&mdash;that is, it will give confidence about competitiveness; it will permit lower levels of interest rates and, therefore, over time, higher levels of investment and spending, particularly on the investment side; and it will have long term implications for Australia's competitive position in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Governor of the central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, said as much in a speech last week called `Structural Adjustment to Low Inflation'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but it has been our view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Reserve Bank's view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for some time that we have made a structural downward shift in inflation and that, with reasonable policies, we should be able to retain it. There has been a fall in inflationary expectations this time which we have never had before.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to amplify the points with charts, and he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the rate of growth of earnings has come down pari passu with the rate of inflation. In the event, there turned out to be no `floor'. What was left of the centralised system was flexible enough to adjust to the recession and the sharp fall in consumer prices.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about wage flexibility. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, for the first time that I am aware, the union movement has accepted the principle that Australian wages should be determined in relation to the growth in prices and wages of our trading partners. This is a very big change of attitude, and it mirrors some other changes that are going on in the economy at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>He talks about the underlying rate being probably 2 1/2 to 3 per cent. I concur with those sentiments and I concur with the attempt by the Deputy Governor to inculcate a lower inflationary culture in the economy.

And as I read the paper, I thought it was without question the best argument I've ever seen for why the Reserve Bank should have a good shake-up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That choice is between an Opposition which has now declared itself as lamenting&mdash;as opposed to actually intending to do anything about it&mdash;what it describes as the failure to provide substantial numbers of dead-end jobs for young people. The Party on this side of the House believes that what our young people need and want, and what this nation needs, is training. We have had several opportunities, in statements made both last year and this year, to provide an opportunity for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's question goes to the issue of traineeships and apprentices. In the March 1991 statement the Government announced a set of measures that included a living allowance for unemployed apprentices and trainees to assist them to complete their basic trade training at TAFE, funds for private training providers to run intensive training courses for unemployed apprentices, a subsidy for employers of third and fourth year apprentices and increased incentives to encourage employers to recruit apprentices and trainees. In February this year I announced a further $33m package of measures to assist apprentices and trainees at risk due to the recession, and in the One Nation statement the Prime Minister announced a further $49m for prevocational places for 10,000 unemployed young people, $6m in special training assistance for group training schemes and an extension for another year of the measures announced last March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures have worked, as honourable members will no doubt be pleased to know. The take-up of the March 1991 initiatives has exceeded targets. At the end of April this year well over 8,000 unemployed or at risk apprentices have been assisted and 7,040 unemployed apprentices have been assisted into new apprenticeships or in their efforts to continue with their trade training. Nearly 1,150 later year apprentices who were at risk of retrenchment have been retained in their jobs. The response by group training companies to the One Nation initiatives has been encouraging. Twenty-two projects have already been approved, providing employment or training opportunities for over 800 apprentices and trainees. And there is more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, the combination of measures has turned around the serious declines in traineeship and apprenticeship commencements that were evident in 1991. As all honourable members who take an interest in these matters know, after every single recession we have had&mdash;the last one was no exception&mdash;we have had to gallop to recruit skilled workers to this country or else confront major bottlenecks in industry which hamper recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly where the Opposition's policy on traineeships now stands. With these replicated circumstances, those opposite would produce exactly those conditions again. Yet they parade around the country saying that they are in favour of reducing immigration rates, whilst putting in place policies which mean that that could never be done unless we were prepared to flatten the economy forever. There is an absolute dichotomy between what those opposite say they intend to achieve and their objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not understand that because of where they stand mentally as far as these issues are concerned. They are exactly where the honourable member for Bennelong is: lamenting the disappearance of dead-end jobs, jobs that have been disappearing from the economy for the past 30 years as there has been an ever higher requirement placed on us for more effective employees. As Ross Gittins had occasion to say in his `Monday Comment' column of a week or two ago, entitled `Good riddance to the dead-end job', in respect of the fact that young people are now in training:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a positive development. Our kids have got the message that has so far eluded Mr Howard: the path to material prosperity (not to mention job satisfaction and job security) is via the acquisition of economically valuable skills.

Preserving and improving our standard of living requires not only greater investment in physical technology, but greater investment in skills.</PARA>

I think we need to have a good knowledge of the facts and certainly that is what I have and that is what my colleagues here have.</PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian Premier slapped his coalition colleague down in making those remarks and repudiated the sort of big bang approach to industrial arbitration. At the same time <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS> has reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We checked with the office of the shadow industrial relations spokesman John Howard this week and had it confirmed that in enterprise based bargaining the coalition policy will be that workers in an enterprise will be able to call in their union, if they so wish, to negotiate with management. That is what the APPM workers want, what the union wants and what the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, wants. The company repeated this week that it will not negotiate with the union, only with workers. In taking APPM's side, Dr Hewson seems to be reversing liberal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that we have seen such headlines around the country as `The battle for Burnie' and `Groom-Hewson rift opens over APPM'. Under the Leader of the Opposition's industrial relations policy, the big bang policy that he described in New Zealand, we would see a battle for Sydney, a battle for Melbourne, a battle for Brisbane and a battle for every other city and provincial city in Australia.

The amendments will be to section 3E of the Act which was introduced by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, in 1989. It will be recalled that those amendments came into the Parliament, into the law, after the Fitzgerald Royal Commission when it became clear that there was a need for certain law enforcement agencies around the country, both State and Federal, to have access to tax information when it was necessary for pursuing suspicions or suggestions of serious offences being committed, information from the tax files being deemed to he helpful in those inquiries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will specifically extend to the WA Royal Commission and other royal commissions prescribed by regulation access to relevant tax information provided for in section 3E.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this in some perspective, it is estimated that these three projects alone will boost export earnings by between $500m and $800m per annum. That represents an increase in the value of mineral and energy exports of some 2 to 3 per cent. These three projects belie the commonly held view that the resources sector is simply about `digging it up and shipping it out'. They have come this far because of their very strong technological base, continued and major exploration programs, work force and management&mdash;which has persisted to overcome formidable technical difficulties&mdash;and because there is a clear understanding of the global commodity markets and expected demand for particular commodities. They will proceed because there will be a level of investment which will ensure international competitiveness and the local environment are protected through careful management programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have proposed this matter of public importance to highlight the fact that this Government is basically lurching from crisis from crisis. In its ministerial appointments we have just had an extraordinary display of a Labor Party, as a result of the factions, putting in a time server. I must say&mdash;and I am sorry that the Speaker has gone&mdash;that the only good thing about the elevation of the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) is that it will mean the end of the Speaker. Apart from that, we have this crisis at a time when Australia looks to the Government for a set of solutions for people who are unemployed, but this Government and all its factions spend all their time looking for the job of one rather than looking to provide a capacity for this country to provide jobs to the nearly one million people who are unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the umbrella of this amazing saga of Senator Richardson, with all his wheeling and dealing over the years, in recent weeks we have also seen all the evidence one would ever need to show that the Government's control over the economy has literally fallen apart. The classic example of that, I suppose, is the Budget deficit, which has blown out to $9.3 billion. It is nearly beyond belief that in the August Budget last year the Government said the deficit would be $4.7 billion. By the time we got to February it was $6.8 billion. The Government said it had checked the figures and that that would definitely be it. But about 10 weeks later the deficit has gone from $6.8 billion to $9.3 billion&mdash;$2,500m more. These guys are either lying about the state of the Budget or they are accused of monumental incompetence when it comes to having any idea of what is actually happening in the Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that, when honourable members opposite made all their promises in February in this charade which they called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the Government's plan for Australia&mdash;the truth is that they did not have the money to pay for it. If you are in any doubt, not only did they not have the money to pay for all these empty promises&mdash;all of which are basically to be put on the international Bankcard&mdash;but also the revelation that the Budget deficit has gone from $6.8 billion to $9.3 billion ought to convince even the most cynical of those who might otherwise support the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that they do not have the money to pay for their promises. If they are to fulfil their promises contained in the One Nation statement, which is a pretty big question mark on its own, one of two things will have to happen, if not both; that is, there will have to be higher taxes or higher interest rates as they borrow to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation, as it is called by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is their plan. The coalition came out with Fightback last year, which was the most detailed, comprehensive reform agenda ever produced by an Opposition. We showed how we could turn this country around, how we could create two million jobs and how, as a nation, we could start paying back our massive and spiralling debt. In response to that, as everyone knows, the Government came up with a statement which it calls One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to look at the basis upon which One Nation was constructed and show why the whole thing is just a pack of cards which has come tumbling down around their ears. The first thing about One Nation is that it made a whole lot of assumptions. Honourable members tried to work out what the growth in the Australian economy would be in the few years ahead. They estimated that the growth in the Australian economy would be 4.75 per cent starting from 1 July. Quite frankly, that figure in itself was unrealistic and totally optimistic. The reason they thought they could get away with it was in the hope that, by the time the next election came along, the figures would not be out and it would be difficult to disprove otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that since then many leading commentators have shot holes in the 4.75 per cent assumption. It is not going to happen. Even the OECD&mdash;which basically has the Government holding its hand as it writes the report&mdash;says that the growth rate for Australia in the ensuing year will be 3 per cent, not 4.75 per cent. If we look at the investment data that has come out in recent weeks, we can see what an absolute charade and what a facade One Nation was when it came to its projections in respect of investment. We had a 2 per cent fall in investment in the March quarter and, on the Access Economics estimates, capital stock declined in the December quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to be economists to work out one very simple fact, and that is that we are not going to have a sustained recovery in Australia until people have some confidence in the future of this country and are prepared to start to invest. Investment is not going up, as the Government has projected, from 1 July; the harsh reality is that investment is falling. Even on the Australian Bureau of Statistics latest expectations data&mdash;and admittedly it is not comparing apples exactly with apples&mdash;the expectation for the ensuing year is a 4 per cent decline in investment, not the 4 per cent increase on which those opposite have based all their figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank&mdash;and perhaps his speech was disappointing in some ways&mdash;said in respect of growth that a 5 per cent figure was unrealistic. I will come back to that in a moment. But the Government's official figure is 4.75 per cent, and he said that nobody in his right mind would believe 5 per cent. The Government's plan for the future of this country is based on what it reckons is going to happen by way of growth, and there is hardly a person in the country who believes that there is any credibility in those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point goes to the Budget. I think those opposite are either lying or incompetent, because back in February it just happened to suit the Government's convenience to say that the deficit would be 6.8 per cent&mdash;`We've got the system under control'. The last thing the Government wanted to know back in February was that there would be a blow-out of $2 1/2 billion. Why was that? It was because it would not be able to afford its One Nation claims if the deficit did blow out to that extent. That was despite the fact that a group of economic forecasters outside of Treasury actually picked the right figure of $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that I find it beyond belief that his people had no idea of the blow-out in the Federal Budget deficit when that figure came down in February. I believe he did know. I admit that I cannot prove it, but remember the saying: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. That is the truth of the $9.3 billion. But there is another point that arises when we look at the Budget and revenue, and that is that, with regard to One Nation, its growth figures are shonky. That is clear and obvious for everybody to see. Another revealing thing is that in One Nation the Government said, `We are going to get so much money coming in', calculated on the assumption of a certain level of inflation. Most people have heard about bracket creep. As inflation goes up we pay a bit more tax as we go through the progressive income tax scales. I used to say `tax creep' until someone said I was being personal about the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had an expectation of what inflation would be. The latest inflation figures came in and they were lower than what the Government thought they would be, which meant therefore that the revenue from bracket creep would be reduced. There was a very revealing press conference with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer not so long ago, and a journalist picked up on this point. He started to ask the Prime Minister, `Hang on, you built this sort of house of cards on certain expectations of how much money is going to come in. You have just said you are going to get less money from bracket creep. Where is the rest of the money coming from? Your tax cuts are based on bracket creep. But if inflation is lower, how are you going to fund your tax cuts?'. The world's greatest Treasurer&mdash;he is really bright, this bloke&mdash;said, `Well, the brackets will be creeping less, won't they?'. This is classic Keatingese. This is the smart alec at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The journo is rather pleased about this, because he has the Prime Minister on a hook now and he is really starting to squirm.

Then came this answer, which shows that there is not much between ear and ear when it comes to this bloke sitting at the front: `Therefore'&mdash;then there was a pause and the penny was just starting to drop&mdash;`well, we will see'.

<PARA>He has really jumped in with both feet.

He has this proposition that is shonky from start to finish, he is in a bit of hot water, so he adds a bit on, and we get to the 5 per cent that even Macfarlane said we could not have a bar of. So here they are, they have no money and they are starting to hunt around to see where they can get the money from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing we find is the Treasurer on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> one night. The obvious thing is that maybe they will get the money by spending less and cutting expenditure. The Treasurer said, `In the past we got there through expenditure restraint, but very substantial expenditure cuts'. Then he said, `But then again, we do not think that expenditure cuts will play such an important role on this occasion'. The first choice is that they might get the money by cutting back somewhere else. He has basically ruled that out. There goes option No. 1. That was a good one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to miss anything out here. Next the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) waltzed down to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program to be interviewed by that tenacious reporter and journalist extraordinaire, Mr Laurie Oakes. The first question to Mr Willis was: `Are you going to cut back on expenditure?'. In fact, he is going to increase expenditure; he is going to give more money to the States. On the question of cutting, they might cut a little bit&mdash;a snip here and a snip there&mdash;but that would just pay for something else that they might spend the money on. The Treasurer is going to increase expenditure; certainly, he is not going to cut expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get to the big question. They have not got the expenditure. We already know they are going to borrow; that is the second option. These guys are very good at borrowing. In their One Nation statement, they are up to their ears in debt. It is amazing; Australia has a debt of $145 billion, and they are going to borrow over $20 billion in the next four years to pay for it. We are literally drowning in debt. Of course, that borrowing means higher interest rates, so we are going to cop higher interest rates if Labor is re-elected, whatever happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get to the other option; then we get to the dandy of them all. When asked, `Will you give us a guarantee you won't increase taxes?'&mdash;that is the other place they can get the money from&mdash;what did the Minister for Finance say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think it's appropriate to make those sort of guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is. These guys are going to increases taxes. When we asked the Treasurer at Question Time, `Do you agree with what Mr Willis said?', he answered, `I am not going to tell you how to put a Budget together'. Then he said, `Of course, we would consider various components of the revenue'. That is a bit of bureaucrat talk which means tax increases. Just to settle it in everybody's minds, today they are bringing in their legislation to change the sales tax. The sales tax is a hidden consumption tax. They are not going to just fiddle at the edges; they are going to start again. It is going to be a new consumption tax. That is the tax that the Government will massively increase after the next election, if it is elected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have frequently had to complain about the hopeless task one is confronted with when trying to debate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith). He tries to participate simply in the context of a debate taking place on the electronic media, just mouthing slogans or repeating gross distortions and inaccuracies. The task of answering such a debate is difficult enough; but when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as he did today, simply accuses the Government of having resorted to taxes and of being likely to resort to taxes again when putting its Budget together, he simply displays a breathtaking lack of knowledge about the national accounts&mdash;or, alternatively, he is simply in the business of telling the big lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is something which comes very easily to members of the Opposition. In fact, in the course of this Government's period of office we have seen a reduction in the size of the revenues as a proportion of the total economy to the point where government revenue of all kinds, State and Commonwealth, is lower than that of any OECD country apart from Japan. We are right at the bottom in terms of tax raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition started by referring to a deficit blow-out. I simply want to record this for his information and for that of the joker sitting next to him. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) may well remember uttering these words. On 17 August 1982 the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, stood where I stand now and, in terms of the Budget he was putting together, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has necessarily meant some increase in the size of the overall Budget deficit compared with last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the outcome&mdash;a deficit of $1.674 billion&mdash;is only one per cent of gross domestic product . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What was the outcome of that Budget 12 months later, at the end of June 1983? In fact, a deficit forecast at the time of $1.6 billion had grown to a massive $4.5 billion. It was not one per cent of GDP, as claimed; it had grown to 2.6 per cent of GDP. Of course, the then Treasurer was following a long tradition of Liberal Treasurers. We have to go back to the very early 1950s to find a Liberal Treasurer who did not bring in a Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This talk that it is this Government which is about increasing public sector debt is totally wrong&mdash;and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it. There has not been a Liberal Treasurer who has brought in a Budget surplus in 40 years. For 40 years Liberal Treasurers have been bringing in Budget deficits. If we go back to the most recent period of Liberal Treasurers we find that the average of their Budget deficits during the period of their reign was, in fact, 2.4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite now have the cheek to complain that this year, with a Budget deficit of 2.4 per cent of GDP, we are to be condemned. They did not have that for just one year; they had it every year. Every year, on average, those opposite brought in a Budget deficit of the size which will be recorded for this particular financial year: 2.4 per cent of GDP this year, compared with 2.4 per cent of GDP for every year under a Liberal government during the period between the Whitlam and Hawke-Keating governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people really have to be judged on the basis of their own credibility on this question of Budgets, of deficit and of debt. The other point that is worth bearing in mind is that when the Opposition gave itself the chance to put together some prospective Budgets in the context of its Opposition policies, in fact we found them lamentably lacking. We have so far been able to record $6 billion worth of shortfalls in terms of the arithmetic which is intended to support the GST&mdash;$6 billion worth of shortfalls. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member knows it is true and he has not been able to dent these Treasury and Finance discoveries of holes in his prospective Budget figuring. This is not my accusation; this is not my assertion. It is the assertion of the Finance and Treasury officials: the ones whom the Opposition finds so easy to disparage, the ones who have the responsibility and the expertise to put together Budgets and the knowledge to criticise the efforts of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition stands here in tatters. It does not have a policy which stands up because the whole of the support mechanism and the compensation package for its proposals is a mess. In fact, the Opposition cannot fund it because there is a $6 billion hole. The last people on earth who should be criticising us in the context of our Budget work are, of course, those opposite and, most particularly, their Deputy Leader who took responsibility for putting together the figuring of the Opposition's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As though they have discovered some gem, those opposite say that we should have known in January that the Budget deficit this year was going to blow out. They say, `Access Economics told you'. Access Economics actually said in January that it expected there to be a huge shortfall in PAYE collections. That was the basis on which it made its calculations about a Budget deficit. At the time I asked what was happening to PAYE collections and what was the current estimate of PAYE collections. I was told that PAYE collections were not only on track, but also it had no reason to alter the estimate. Indeed, even now, the estimate is within $100m of the Budget-time estimate of PAYE collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is just fatuous and ignorant for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to suggest that, because Access told us in January, we should have factored it in. What Access told us was actually totally wrong because what it thought was going to be the ingredient of the shortfall was not. In the press statement I made on this question when we published the May review of this year's Budget, I actually identified the areas in which the revenue shortfall had occurred. As I said at the time, it was due primarily to a nearly $600m shortfall in company collections and a $1.5 billion shortfall in the context of individuals, other than those who pay via the PAYE mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no way, I am told, that the Tax Office could have known when it was asked the question in January that those collections were going to be well below the Budget time forecast. The reason for that is that until one has the actual evidence of the collections&mdash;typically in March, April and May&mdash;there is no basis on which to deviate from the Budget time estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all just a shabby and somewhat desperate attempt on the part of the Opposition to make something out of a deterioration in the revenue side of the Budget. The idea that the revenue side deterioration is a contributor to the deficit is rather novel as far as the Opposition is concerned. Usually the deterioration in its Budgets, which happened so frequently, was because of the ill discipline that it exhibited in relation to the expenditure side of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expenditure side of our Budget is not a contributor to this year's deficit because we have been able to keep those expenditures under control. The reasons for this&mdash;I have said this many times but of course the Opposition has refused to listen or believe it&mdash;are essentially related to the fact that the economy is doing better on the inflation front. As a result of inflation, lower interest rates and lower than expected earnings in some areas, we have seen lower incomes and, therefore, lower taxes. I do not see what the Opposition is really complaining about when in fact we are collecting less tax from those people who might otherwise have paid more tax. Yet at the same time the Opposition says that we are a government which is interested only in increasing the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting sidelights to this particular debate is that at least it has the Opposition talking about the Government's One Nation statement. Let us recall again why it was that the Government decided to introduce its One Nation statement. It was because the Government's assessment in January of this year was that the recovery was not proceeding as fast as had been anticipated at the time of last year's Budget. Indeed, the Opposition is in here every day, up with the media on every occasion it can, talking down the economy, telling all Australians how poorly we are doing. It is precisely because the economy was doing less well than we thought in January that we decided it was in need of some stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we ever hear the Opposition talking about the need for some stimulus, the need for some promotion of the recovery? No, not at all. That is because the Opposition wants to see this economy in a state of economic paralysis for as long as possible. What terrifies the Opposition beyond belief is that this recovery will take hold, that the economy will begin to improve, that the economic prospects confronting Australians will look considerably better and that, as a consequence, the political climate may vary in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course that is the reason. It is not an interest in the Australian economy; it is not an interest in the fortunes of Australian working men and women; it is not any regard for the future welfare of Australian people that drives the Opposition. The Opposition is simply intent on trying to talk down any suggestion of any glimmer of hope that there might be in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition of course gave the game away when he said, `You don't need to be an economist to know that the recovery will take place when confidence improves'. That is not bad coming from him. That is why the Opposition is about deflating and knocking any suggestion of revived confidence in the Australian economy. Despite the efforts of those opposite, despite their attempt to wreck this economy, despite their passion for postponing any recovery, the recovery is occurring. That of course is fairly gloomy news to those whose stock-in-trade is economic gloom. Although the recovery is as yet somewhat patchy and as yet has not taken root across all sectors of the economy, no-one that I am aware of is suggesting that the recovery has not begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the range of private forecasts about growth in 1992-93 is from 2.5 per cent to 5.4 per cent. So the Government is certainly not alone, and indeed is not on any optimistic extreme as far as its predictions of growth in 1992-93 are concerned. But this is not really a debate on the Opposition's concern about the state of the Budget, because it knows in its more truthful moments that this Government is very well equipped to put together a Budget appropriate for Australia's economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those opposite lament, and lament again, is that our policies are working and that Australia is working its way back into a period of growth. That is the thing which horrifies the Opposition; that is the thing which promotes the greatest gloom for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I find that whole process somewhat fascinating because I can tell honourable members that he did not meet a lot of people. To highlight one point, I want to read a short letter that I wrote to the Prime Minister in the genuine interests of businesses in my electorate and of my region. The letter was dated 8 January and was written as a result of information from the Prime Minister saying that he wanted to talk to businesses all around the country. My letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was delighted to read in this morning's newspapers that you have announced your intention to meet key business and union leaders in Melbourne next week to ascertain what is required in the proposed mini-budget.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind, I take this opportunity to invite you to the electorate of Isaacs during your visit to Melbourne next week. Both the Moorabbin Industrial Estate and the Braeside Industrial Estate are located within the boundaries of Isaacs and together these estates comprise a substantial part of Australia's manufacturing sector. Businesses in this area have experienced the full brunt of Australia's current economic crisis and a meeting with them would be an invaluable experience for yourself, Mr Dawkins, Mr Willis and Senator Button.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that concerns me with all of this is that we have heard the rhetoric of what this Government is going to do about talking to small business, but it never occurs on the ground. The reason why I wanted the Treasurer&mdash;probably shadow Treasurer after the next election&mdash;to stay in this place and listen to the comments is that I think the information I have got is more up to date than the information he is getting from his advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to all the real estate agents in my electorate, who are the people who are actually letting factories and collecting the money at the end of each month for rent. What worries me is that they say that currently they are 50 per cent down on their letting of factories on what they were previously. But, more importantly, these real estate agents tell me that more than 25 per cent of the factories that are let out are over six months behind with their rental payments. That signals a problem to me&mdash;it may not signal one to the Treasurer, who is more interested in producing rhetoric in this place&mdash;because if 25 per cent of those companies are six months behind in the payment of their rent, then how far are they behind with their creditors? What chance have those companies got of getting back on their feet even if we do see some of the recovery aspects that this Treasurer is talking to us about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is all too happy to come in here and to say there is patchy recovery but it is actually happening and he is willing this to happen; but the fact of the matter is that many of these businesses which are out over six months are out to that extent simply because they cannot close their doors. Do honourable members know why? It is because they cannot afford to make the payouts to their workers; they cannot afford to pay the redundancy payments. All of these things need to be talked about and need to be explained to this Treasurer, who is quite happy to look at the statistics, which do not explain that position and do not get across the message of where we are headed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that I have written a genuine letter to the Prime Minister of this country saying, `Come down to our region, where in the electorates of Isaacs, Dunkley, Corinella and Holt there is 25 per cent of the manufacturing business of this country'. I would have thought that, when this Prime Minister and the members of Cabinet put together a presentation called One Nation, they would at least have had the decency to respond to the letter I wrote and had the decency to come down to the worst hit State in this country and the area with the highest level of manufacturing in this country to talk to some of these businesses and some of the people who are having problems to see what the real issues and the real problems are.

It is incredible. The Government is talking about what it is going to do to educate people. These people have actually got their VCE, but because there is not work&mdash;26 of them have actually tried to get work, then went onto unemployment benefits and have now gone back to school&mdash;47 of these kids who went out into the community to get themselves a career have gone back to repeat</PARA>

It was interesting in listening to the honourable member for Isaacs to note in particular his concern about manufacturing industry, yet at the very forefront of the Liberal's policy is a zero tariff regime that would decimate manufacturing industry in his own State. So let us not have any more of the nonsense about the Liberals' proposals as far as manufacturing is concerned, or their understanding of the needs of skilling the work force and training and educational opportunities. We have only to look at Fightback to see the way they would destroy those opportunities as well for the vast majority of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth returning to what the matter of public importance is about in relation to the One Nation statement. The One Nation statement was designed to promote economic recovery. It was designed to ensure that the range of needs that applied across the community was accelerated: the needs for public infrastructure, the needs in relation to the aviation industry, the needs in relation to port facilities, the needs in relation to the national rail network, the needs in relation to the national electricity grid&mdash;things about which government in times of recession could take positive action to help ensure they occur, so that as we move into the recovery phase we get the sort of infrastructure that is needed for efficiency and to ensure that industry can grow and prosper. That is clearly what one should do when one is faced with the problems of recession. The Government&mdash;the public sector&mdash;rightly takes stock of that and moves towards meeting those needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, when we look at economic conditions over the last 40 years, that we have had only three Budget surpluses in that time, and they have not come from the virtuous crowd on the Opposition benches. In all their time in government, those opposite could not produce a Budget surplus. All they relied on was deficit after deficit, inflation built into the system totally right through that period. They relied on that inflationary expectation being there to carry it through that period. That is what their whole economic structure was built on: no inflation fighting strategy, no capacity to encourage real growth, and no capacity to ensure that infrastructure was properly maintained and reinforced. At the end of that period, when they left office in 1983, we were left with a Budget deficit which was 4.1 per cent of GDP. That is what we inherited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even allowing for the change that has occurred of a cyclical nature in this period because of the recession, the Budget deficit is only 2.1 per cent of GDP. The net effect of that shows that what we really have is a Budget deficit which in real terms is less than half of what we were left by Fraser, Howard and his advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? It means that basically we now have a different set of arrangements. The change in terms of the deficit that we have now is of a cyclical nature&mdash;it is because of the current recession&mdash;unlike the situation we had in 1983, when the deficit we had at that time was because of structural factors. Those structural factors meant that the Liberals could never produce a Budget surplus. They never sought to produce Budget surpluses; they relied totally on the fact, as I say, that that inflationary expectation was there. That inflationary expectation was built into everything that the Liberals stood for. It was built right through the economy. It is only because of the low inflation expectation that we now have that we can genuinely say that the country can now plan and business can now invest on the basis of low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? It means, as we established recently at the banking inquiry, that instead of the proliferation of lending for property we will get lending for quality business. Business investment will be based on growing and expanding business opportunities rather than on artificial property speculation and so on. That will be important for the financial system and the economic system as a whole. The net result of that is going to be more production, more investment, greater productivity and a more productive national economy. That is what One Nation is really all about. To suggest that somehow the Fightback strategy&mdash;the alternative strategy&mdash;is designed to do that is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) spend day after day lambasting the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. They make the most outrageous statements about the role of the Governor and the Deputy Governor because of the speech the Deputy Governor made recently. What do we get today? Because there is one element in the Deputy Governor's speech in relation to growth, where the Deputy Governor has referred to a 5 per cent growth rate, those opposite use that as gospel. Yet throughout Question Time, day after day over recent weeks in the Parliament, we have had the Opposition saying that the Reserve Bank should be treated in all sorts of ways: it should be scrapped, it should be made to toe the line and its officers should be sacked if they do not reach certain inflation projections. Yet the only thing we can say the Deputy Leader of the Opposition relied on was the fact that the Deputy Governor of the Bank had said that a growth rate of 5 per cent was unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we can say with absolute certainty is that the growth we will get coming out of the recession will be significant growth. Already, if we look at the range of data, there are clear signs of that growth starting to occur. The honourable member for Isaacs relies on one month's figures for car registrations to suggest that that is all illusory. He forgets the previous three months as far as car registrations are concerned. He wants to forget the growth in the housing area as far as bank lending is concerned. He wants to forget the recovery that is occurring across those areas. There is certainly scope for much more growth because of the very real recession we have had and the real pain we have had associated with that recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we now have a number of things working in our favour. We have the lowest inflation rate in 20 years; we have the lowest interest rates in 20 years. Those opposite can say that all of those things do not matter, but the fact is that throughout the period when the cuts in interest rates have occurred, since February 1990, the Opposition has opposed every single one of those cuts. Every single time interest rates have been cut in the last 2 1/2 years the Opposition has said it is premature to be doing that; that the Government is doing it for political reasons; that the Reserve Bank is a tool of the Government in cutting those rates. Despite the Opposition claiming that on every single occasion, the gradual reduction in interest rates down to the present official rate of 6 1/2 per cent has had the effect of helping to bring the economic stabilisers into operation, as we would rightly expect in this phase of the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of all of that has been not the sort of run on the dollar and the risk to inflation that the Leader of the Opposition talked about through that time, but quite the reverse. The dollar has stayed stable through those cuts in rates; the level of inflation has been reduced to the level we have now, where for the last quarter we have a zero figure for inflation. What matters is that as we move into the recovery stage the growth we get is real growth&mdash;and it will be; that the investment we get is real investment in new business opportunities, as it will be; and that the impact throughout the economy is the creation of the jobs that the One Nation economic statement was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of factors came into effect in relation to the change in the projection for this year's Budget deficit. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has referred to that. I do not intend to dwell on that matter, other than to say that the changes relating to company tax collections clearly come to light only at this time of the year. It is not until we get to the last quarter of the year that we start to have any real understanding of where that particular company tax collection is going to be made. The change in relation to the tax file number is clearly another factor that we could not have foreseen earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What matters is that, as we get the growth coming out of the One Nation economic statement, that growth will be felt throughout the economy, in all the key sectors. The efficiencies that are delivered through One Nation will mean that companies can have real, efficient gains in terms of their business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really what One Nation is all about. That is why the basic economic projections that are outlined in One Nation are valid; that is why the scenario that is set in One Nation, which provides for a budgetary surplus in 1995-96, can be achieved. Because the fundamental structure is sound and the economy is cyclical, growth starts to occur. As growth starts to occur, the revenue side of the Budget is retained. It has not been the expenditure side that has been affected by the current changes; it has been the revenue side. As growth occurs, the revenue side comes back to the rightful projections. As a result of that, the prediction in One Nation for a Budget surplus by 1995-96 will be achieved. That has clearly been the strategy that has been in place all along. The Treasurer is entitled to say that will be maintained. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a major piece of legislation on a matter which so deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill will make discrimination on the basis of disability unlawful in Australia. The Bill will assist all people with disabilities to exercise their rights as Australian citizens and represents a landmark in achieving human rights for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with disabilities are entitled to the same rights and the same opportunities as all other Australian citizens. However, our society currently falls well short of realising this ideal. People are still subjected to discrimination purely on the basis of disability&mdash;discrimination which, I am sure all honourable members would agree, is socially damaging, morally unacceptable and a cost to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has shown that people with disabilities still face a number of barriers to the equal enjoyment of human rights in many areas of life. These include employer and co-worker attitudes, access to premises and transport and the types of jobs available. During an extensive series of consultations about ways to address these barriers, people with disabilities, their families and advocates and service providers called upon the Government to introduce comprehensive disability discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has a long term commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities. The Government began the process of expanding opportunities for people with disabilities in 1983 with the comprehensive review of programs and services for people with disabilities&mdash;the handicapped programs review. The outcomes of this review culminated in the implementation of the Disability Services Act in 1987. The Act requires that services for people with disabilities be provided in a manner consistent with their rights as Australian citizens and as human beings. These include the right to dignity, privacy, choice and the fulfilment of their capacities to contribute fully in community life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act is regarded internationally as a significant step forward in legislative support for services assisting people with disabilities. It was welcomed by people with disabilities, their families and representatives. The principles and objectives of the Act provided Australia with a set of ideals to strive for and today the Act has won widespread community understanding and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, at the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, I think it timely to be able to introduce legislation which will extend these principles to all walks of life. The principles need to be taken up within society as a whole so that they reach all Australians with disabilities, regardless of whether they are receiving support services under the Disability Services Act. The Disability Discrimination Bill will be instrumental in continuing social change and will have far-reaching and long-awaited effects for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe there is any better example of social justice than this legislation&mdash;legislation which provides the framework to eliminate the discrimination which prevents fair access for people with disabilities to jobs, education, sport and entertainment and which provides an effective means of overcoming perhaps the most significant barrier that people with disabilities face in this country&mdash;the attitudinal barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill recognises that discrimination against people with disabilities is a matter of international concern. It is another significant step in fulfilling Australia's international obligations under a number of United Nations instruments. These include the International Labour Organisation Convention concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and a number of related declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, none of this would have been possible without the commitment and courage of people who believed in the legislation. While I do not like to single out any particular individuals in the process, Mr Graeme Innes, Chairperson of the Disability Advisory Council of Australia and Ms Chris Ronalds and the representatives of the Disability Anti-Discrimination Legislation Committee bear special mention. Today, not 12 months after the establishment of this Committee, we are in the fortunate position of bringing this significant indicator of the Government's continuing commitment to social justice before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall response from industry groups and State governments has also been very positive. The Government has received extensive comment from interested parties in relation to the proposal to introduce legislation. The Bill will be left to lie in the House over the winter recess so that interested parties can make any further comments. This timing builds on the widespread discussions already undertaken on the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative reform is vital if the very real, but unfair, barriers that prevent people with disabilities from playing effective and valued roles are to be broken down. The legislation would constitute the legal basis for the protection and promotion of the rights of people with disabilities and would subsequently help to overcome social and economic disadvantage by assisting people with disabilities to participate as equals in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a more detailed description of the Bill. The legislation would be grievance-based and fundamentally similar to the Commonwealth's existing anti-discrimination legislation: the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The legislation would promote gradual structural reforms and attitudinal change&mdash;changes which would enhance the opportunities available to people with disabilities throughout community life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objects of the Bill are to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of disability in the areas of work, accommodation, education, clubs, sport, the provision of goods, facilities, services and land, existing laws and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; to ensure, as far as practicable, that people with disabilities have the same rights to equality before the law as their fellow citizens; and to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle that people with disabilities have the same fundamental rights as their fellow citizens. The legislation would therefore perform an important educative role and would further social awareness and change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would cover both direct and indirect discrimination on the ground of disability and would also cover discrimination on the basis of association with people with disabilities. The legislation would apply throughout Australia and, in this regard, relies on all available and appropriate heads of Commonwealth constitutional power. In the preparation of this Bill, the Government has paid attention to existing State disability discrimination legislation and the role played by State disability discrimination machinery in eliminating discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disability anti-discrimination legislation currently exists in differing forms in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Such legislation is proposed for Tasmania and the Northern Territory. However, there are considerable variations in the scope and coverage of the various Acts. National, comprehensive legislation is required in order to ensure that people with disabilities are not disadvantaged by their place of residence. Moreover, State legislation alone does not provide comprehensive coverage for people with disabilities, due to the limited ability of the States to regulate discriminatory practices against Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill includes a definition of disability that draws upon existing definitions in both Commonwealth and State legislation and includes the concepts of physical, sensory, intellectual and psychiatric impairment. The definition of disability includes the total or partial loss of a bodily function; the presence in the body of organisms causing, or capable of causing, disease, including HIV AIDS; total or partial loss of a part of the body; and malfunction or disfigurement of part of a person's body. It includes a disability which presently exists, existed in the past but has now ceased to exist, or may exist in the future, and a disability which is imputed or presumed to a person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now describe the areas in which the Bill proscribes discrimination on the ground of disability. The legislation would make unlawful discrimination against applicants for jobs and employees generally and would include access to employment; the practices of employment agencies; the use of discriminatory questions in employment application forms; access to opportunities for promotion, transfer or training, or to any other benefits connected with employment; and dismissal of an employee or subjecting an employee to any detriment. The legislation would also cover the employment of agents and contract workers; membership as a partner in a firm; membership of a trade union; and any action of a licensing or a qualifying body with respect to the conferring, renewal or extension of any licence or qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to education, it would be unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate in the admission and treatment of students and in the provision of all levels of education, training and vocational or educational assistance, including financial assistance. It would be unlawful to discriminate against people with a disability in relation to the provision of access to premises, including vehicles to which the general public has access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would also make unlawful discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, covering the supply, and term of supply or provision, of goods and facilities and the provision of services, including services relating to banking, insurance and the provision of grants, loans, credit or finance; services relating to entertainment, recreation or refreshment; services relating to transport, travel or telecommunications; services of any profession or trade; selling or leasing an interest in land; and services provided by a government, government authority or local government body. Discrimination relating to the provision of accommodation, including access to any benefits associated with accommodation, would also be unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would mean that it would be unlawful for a club, the committee or management of a club, or a committee member, to discriminate on the ground of disability, including membership and access to the benefits associated with membership. The legislation would also apply to sporting and recreational activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would cover administrative practices adopted by people charged with the administration of Commonwealth enactments, where the enactment does not itself authorise the discrimination. The legislation would make it unlawful to require another person to provide information on which unlawful discrimination might be based, unless the information is reasonably required for a lawful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for two general exemptions: unjustifiable hardship and the inherent requirements of the job. These exemptions will be very significant in terms of the overall effects of this legislation on service providers, businesses and employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Bill, employers, providers of accommodation, education, goods and services, clubs and sporting groups would be able to argue that action necessary to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities would impose unjustifiable hardship. In determining unjustifiable hardship, all of the relevant circumstances of a particular case would be taken into account. These circumstances would include the nature of the benefit or detriment likely to accrue or be suffered by any persons concerned, the effect of the impairment of the persons concerned, and the financial circumstances and the estimated amount of expenditure required to be made by the person claiming unjustifiable hardship. Any judgment made would allow for the financial viability of an employer having to meet additional costs even where, on the face of it, the costs would appear to be fairly small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would not require that people with disabilities be given jobs which they cannot do. Subsequently there is an exemption which does not prohibit discrimination if the person is not able to perform adequately the inherent requirements of the job, even where reasonable accommodation has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains a provision which requires the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to take into account the provision of any action plan lodged by a service provider or educational authority when determining whether unjustifiable hardship exists in relation to a particular complaint. These plans are entirely voluntary, but the Bill indicates that they shall include certain provisions if they are drawn up. These include policies and programs to achieve the objects of the Bill; the communication of those policies and programs to persons within the body preparing the plan; the setting of goals or targets against which the success of the plan may be measured; the means of evaluating the policies and programs developed; the revision of the plan; and the appointment of persons charged with the implementation of the plans. The plans would be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and would be publicly available. The Commission will not be required to agree to a plan lodged with it, but the plan will have to be considered by the Commission when determining whether unjustifiable hardship exists in the circumstance that a complaint is made against the particular agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes it clear that once a complainant has been able to show that he has been subjected to unlawful discrimination, a respondent claiming unjustifiable hardship would bear an evidentiary burden. Similarly, an employer will have to determine what the inherent requirements of a particular job might be. However, the overall legal burden of proof, in proving discrimination unlawful, will remain with the complainant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special exemptions include those special measures taken to assist people with disabilities to meet their particular needs; affirmative action measures which are designed to enable and encourage equality of opportunity; and insurance and superannuation where there is actuarial or statistical data to support a particular action. Acts done under statutory authority, in direct compliance with any other Acts, regulations, rules or by-laws, and acts done in accordance with determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would be exempt from the legislation for a period of three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special exemptions would also apply to infectious diseases; to participation in sporting activities for people with particular disabilities; the provision of pensions under specific Acts; and to the recruitment of certain defence force personnel. Further, an exemption of three years would apply to telecommunications to allow for the impact of the legislation on Telecom and the proposed second carrier to be properly assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision is also made for applications to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for short term, renewable exemptions from all or parts of the legislation. The Commission would have the power to make interim determinations to preserve the status quo or the rights of the parties to a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administration of the legislation would be vested in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The functions of the Commission would include holding inquiries into and making determinations on complaints; hearing applications for exemption from the Act; undertaking research and educational programs; and examination of existing and proposed legislation to ensure its consistency with the provisions of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill would establish a Disability Discrimination Commissioner who is required to investigate and conciliate complaints of discrimination on the ground of disability. The Commissioner would be empowered to dismiss a complaint if found to be unsubstantiated, or attempt to reach a settlement of the complaint. The Commissioner would have the power to summons witnesses to give evidence or produce documents and to call compulsory conferences. The aim of the legislation would be to promote resolution through conciliation wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, where the Commissioner was unable to resolve a complaint by conciliation, he or she would have the power to refer the matter to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commission would then consider the complaint and make a determination on that complaint based on the requirements of the Act. The determination of the Commission would not of itself be binding. Should a party wish to enforce the determination of the Commission an application would be made to the Federal Court. That court would then hear the matter again and make a legally binding judgment taking into account the same criteria taken into account by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains provisions to allow for the making of disability standards in the future. Equivalent standards are provided for in both the American and Canadian legislation of this sort. These standards would not be made without extensive consultations by the Commonwealth with all affected parties. The Bill contains provisions requiring that account be taken of comments by State and Territory governments before such standards are enacted. A national public education and awareness campaign will accompany the introduction of this legislation in order to raise the level of understanding of people with disabilities about their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct financial implications of this legislation relate to the establishment of the Office of Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the public education and awareness campaign, some minor additional public service staffing and additional resources for support and representative agencies.

<PARA>The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugar cane to 15c per tonne, as provided for in section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. The Bill has been prepared following a request from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request was made by the Australian Cane Growers Council, represented by Canegrowers, and the Australian Cane Farmers Association on behalf of sugar cane growers and the Australian Sugar Milling Council on behalf of the millers of sugar cane. </PARA>

The current rate of levy is 6c per tonne. However, the sugar industry has indicated its wish to increase that levy to 14c per tonne for the 1992 season. The current maximum levy rate of 10c per tonne is thus hindering this increase and so preventing the sugar industry from utilising the full potential of the Commonwealth R&amp;D scheme. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the initiative announced in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to alleviate the problems small and medium sized Australian firms have experienced in obtaining patient equity capital. It also reflects changes to the announced program made to enhance its attractiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the establishment of investment companies, to be called pooled development funds, which will provide patient equity capital for eligible activities in Australian companies with total assets not greater than $30m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns of industry expressed most frequently to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is the failure of the Australian capital market to provide long term development capital for productive investment. The problem was raised again during the consultations that Ministers had with business prior to the One Nation statement. It is difficult to prove the case about the lack of development capital, but the anecdotal evidence is quite strong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a compelling need to improve the flow of development capital to revitalise and restructure mature industries by the application of new technologies, new processes and new management; assist the growth and development of new industries and firms; and provide basic competence in generic technologies such as biotechnology, information technology, new materials and manufacturing technologies which will be fundamental to industry competitiveness in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small and medium sized firms are the wellspring from which much of the future growth and prosperity of the Australian economy depends. The potential for growth of these firms is influenced by their ability to fund investment to expand production capacity or to enter new markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that there are imperfections in the capital market and that small and medium sized firms often have difficulty in obtaining equity capital, especially those that are technology based or those that are in the early stages of potentially rapid growth. Suitable development capital is often unavailable for such firms because suppliers of capital are risk averse and often have a short-term investment outlook; they do not have access to the same range of sources of capital as do larger firms, particularly as there is no reliable and easily accessible market for trading equity in small businesses; and adverse economic conditions have encouraged investors to concentrate on established, larger and safer businesses. This program is an important element in the Government's overall strategy of removing impediments to the growth of Australian industry and improving the employment prospects for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill establishes a Pooled Development Funds Registration Board, comprising a chairperson and four members drawn from the private sector and an officer from the Department to administer the program. The board will advise the Minister annually and at other appropriate times on the operation of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian companies with access to appropriate management expertise and sources of capital may apply to the board for registration as a PDF. The application will need to provide details of the company's investment plans, capital raising strategy, management team and other matters. The Government has decided not to limit the pool of capital that may be invested through the PDFs. Any number of PDFs may be registered and the PDFs can raise as much capital as they can attract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage investment in PDFs, the Government has decided to tax PDFs at 30 per cent rather than at the general company tax rate of 39 per cent, and to allow investors in PDFs to elect to receive their dividends either as tax exempt or through the imputation system. The latter feature is a significant modification of the program since its announcement, and will provide improved benefits for shareholders facing a tax rate below 30 per cent. It has also removed the taxation based inhibitions on low tax investors, such as super funds, from investing in small and medium sized businesses via PDFs. In addition, any gains on the sale of shares in PDFs will be tax exempt. Further details on these incentives will be provided on introduction of the Bill to amend the tax laws to give effect to these and other initiatives in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax benefits will not come into play until the investment activity by the PDFs is successful. In effect, the Government and the shareholders will share the benefits of the PDFs' activities through a lower tax rate and tax exempt returns to shareholders. The benefits to the Government and the economy will come from the expansion in business activity and growth in employment in the PDF investee businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PDFs will be required to comply with certain rules set out in the Bill. The tax benefits are conditional on the PDFs complying with those rules and this will be monitored by the board. While the ultimate sanction for breaking the requirements will be revocation of the PDF status of a particular company, the board will have other discretionary powers to ensure that the spirit of the program is not breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some useful suggestions by investment and fund managers to features of the PDF proposal announced in the One Nation statement. One of the suggestions relates to the nature of the proposed tax incentive, and this has been addressed in the modifications to the tax treatment mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other comments have concentrated on improving the commercial flexibility of the PDFs. The Government has also taken notice of these suggestions by both changing some of the parameters announced earlier and providing the board with discretions to allow it to waive some of the requirements for particular PDFs in certain situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously it was announced that apart from life offices and banks, no investor could own more than 10 per cent of a PDF. Furthermore, a PDF could not invest more than 10 per cent of its funds in any one business. Both of these parameters have been changed to 20 per cent. In addition, in certain circumstances PDFs will be able to invest in previously owned shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to discretions, it is expected that the board will exercise these only where the commercial realities require such action. For example, the intention is that PDFs invest in small and medium sized companies and $30m in total assets has been chosen as the benchmark. However, the board may allow a further investment in companies if the value of the total assets in the investee business exceeds $30m where it is clear that the further investment is desirable to protect earlier ones. These discretions in no way undermine the integrity and objectives of the Government's program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PDFs may invest only in companies and only for the purpose of establishing new businesses or substantially developing new production capacity or markets for established businesses. There is no requirement for PDFs to seek approval for individual investments. The PDFs may not invest more than 5 per cent of their assets in start-up businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that there should be a wide choice in the industry spread for investments by the PDFs. Accordingly, the Bill provides that PDFs may invest in any area of business activity other than:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">retailing operations; and</PARA>
<PARA>.real estate investment other than property investment which is integral to broader eligible activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government expects there will be a broad range of investors in the PDFs. Potential investors, such as corporations and super funds, will have the opportunity of deriving non-tax benefits. Corporate investors derive benefits from emerging technologies and new products that fit their own business activities and expansion plans. Super funds can take advantage of the expertise of the PDF management teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware that this program will not meet all of the needs for channelling capital to small and medium sized firms. In setting up the program, the Government was mindful of the need to contain costs, yet make it sufficiently attractive to ensure its viability. The Government is also aware that in a market economy capital will always be a scarce resource. I believe that the program will become an important vehicle for marshalling capital for small and medium sized businesses, and assist in the process of economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional expenditure of some $400,000 annually will be incurred on an ongoing basis to cover extra costs associated with the administration of the program.

<PARA>The need for the Development Allowance Authority Bill was foreshadowed in the announcement of the development allowance in the Government's One Nation statement of February this year. The Government gives a high priority to the introduction of this and the related One Nation initiatives legislation. Passage of this legislation, in establishing the Development Allowance Authority, the DAA, to facilitate investment and reform in major projects, in conjunction with related amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, brings the development allowance to working reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance itself builds on the advantages of the accelerated depreciation measures also announced in the One Nation statement. The development allowance will achieve this by promoting an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer particular benefits for our competitiveness in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance has two key economic objectives. First, it seeks to encourage an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment. Second, at the same time, it looks to encourage reform both within those companies receiving the allowance and in the economic environment in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allowance is modest in its direct impact on firms&mdash;providing a 10 per cent deduction against assessable income for eligible plant expenditure once incurred. But its indirect effect is potentially much greater. The allowance provides firms looking to undertake large projects with additional leverage to negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda. Ideally, these reforms will work their way through our industrial system to impact positively on the operational environment for those projects not benefiting directly from the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DAA in prequalifying a project for the allowance must be satisfied that the project's contribution to our competitive standing is both sufficient and achievable. Importantly, the development allowance best typifies a central theme of One Nation&mdash;development initiatives being contingent on efficiency gains being achieved. Put simply, the development allowance rewards success and represents a conscious rejection of those policies of the past which underwrote loss and failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After One Nation, Bill Scales, the new Chair of the Industry Commission, reported to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on the operational aspects of the development allowance. This Bill follows from that report. The Bill establishes the DAA and sets out the scope of the Authority's role in assessing the eligibility of projects to prequalify for the development allowance. While the DAA is to determine what plant expenditure, once incurred, will prequalify for the allowance, the final decision as to eligibility will rest with the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DAA is to be a one-member statutory authority operating within the Treasurer's portfolio. The Treasurer will make an announcement shortly as to who will hold the office of the DAA. The DAA will receive support from a secretariat&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority Secretariat&mdash;that is being established within the Treasury. The cost of the development allowance is estimated to be approximately $40m in 1994-95 and $70m in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out a working example of an applicant progressing through the various steps towards obtaining a prequalifying certificate from the DAA. This example highlights how the work of the DAA and the process for obtaining eligibility are framed around a timetable of key trigger dates. These dates reflect the underlying objectives of the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, a project proponent first applies to the DAA to register a project that is expected to meet the eligibility criteria and, unless the project has substantially commenced by end 1992, the competitiveness tests for the development allowance. The DAA then assesses the applicant's case against the criteria set out in the Bill. Once registered, the next stage involves the applicant providing the DAA with documentation that demonstrates that the project has the necessary approvals and authorisations to substantially commence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final phase involves an application and project report to the DAA for a prequalifying certificate. An entity holding a prequalifying certificate claims the development allowance, subject to the relevant tax tests, from the Australian Taxation Office once the expenditure is incurred. I turn now to the key elements of the Bill&mdash;providing for the DAA's assessment of a project against the objectives I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Project Definition</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the legislation is the concept of a project. The allowance is available only to large projects. A threshold has been set of a gross capital expenditure of $50m or more.  Gross capital expenditure is total expenditure of a capital nature that is incurred, or will be incurred, in carrying out the project. Encouraging projects of this magnitude will induce confidence in our economic future. As mentioned before, large projects will be better placed to use the allowance as a lever to secure reform and best practice, both within their operations and the economic environment in which they operate. Further, the demonstration effect of reform secured by these large projects will be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out the meaning of carrying out a project for the purposes of the development allowance. A project may involve establishing a new productive facility in Australia, or establishing two or more related productive facilities that make up either a discrete or vertically integrated project in Australia. A project may also involve expansions, improvements or upgrades of a substantial nature at a new or existing productive facility. Environment upgrades will be eligible. However, projects involving ongoing maintenance-related investment or the aggregation of investment in unrelated productive facilities will not be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A productive facility is defined as a facility used primarily by the operator for the production or distribution of the same or related goods or services. It is also required that plant expenditure is to be incurred wholly or principally for carrying out the project for which the entity is seeking a prequalifying certificate. The intention here is to quarantine the allowance to that plant expenditure that is genuinely for primary use in the eligible project. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Basic Eligibility Test</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic eligibility test reflects the fact that the development allowance is an initiative conceived in the emerging low tariff environment. Certain activities, largely in the non-traded sectors and specified in the Bill, are excluded from eligibility for the allowance. In addition, projects which are heavily assisted are also excluded from eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out a clear test to be applied in establishing whether the project benefits from substantial assistance. This test involves an applicant satisfying the DAA that the project does not have a nominal or effective rate of assistance&mdash;taking the lower&mdash;exceeding 10 per cent. These are accepted measures of assistance, and are to be calculated in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Industry Commission. The calculation will be based on the level of tariff or other foreshadowed levels of assistance that are to apply on 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the entire productive facility fails the basic eligibility test, then none of the expenditure will be eligible for the allowance. If only a part of the project falls within this category, then only that expenditure related to the excluded sector is ineligible. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Competitiveness Test</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitiveness test is the linchpin for the wider benefits of the development allowance initiative. There are two parts to the test. First, the DAA must be satisfied that the project's labour-management arrangements substantially reflect world best practice and, second, that the prices of key inputs to the project's operation are economic and efficient.

The proposed definition of horticulture will apply to taxpayers who are engaged in the cultivation or propagation of plants, including fungi, for themselves or their commercially useful parts, and expressly includes propagation or cultivation in media other than soil. The definition will not apply to activities other than in the course of, or for the purpose of, a business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the main Bill in a package of six Bills that will, as part of the simplification of the sales tax law, replace the existing sales tax legislation. It represents a major overhaul by the Government of the existing sales tax law. Overall, the package of Bills will replace the 27 Acts which currently deal exclusively with sales tax. The Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 will replace the 11 Assessment Acts, and the Sales Tax Procedure Act, that are necessary to administer the law under its current structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main features of the measures are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a significant reduction in the number of persons required to pay sales tax;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a complete restructuring and redrafting of the WST legislation, in plain English, to make it simpler to use and more certain in its application;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a streamlining of the system for acquiring business inputs and other conditionally exempt goods free of tax; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a significant strengthening of the anti-avoidance provisions of the law. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes will complement legislation introduced late last year to expand the range of business inputs which are exempted from tax. The simplification of the sales tax law will bring substantial benefits both for taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office which is responsible for administering the tax. I now turn to the more important changes. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Small Business Concession</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption for small business has been considerably widened so that it will offer to the majority of taxpayers the option of not paying tax. Exemption will now be available to all persons liable to pay sales tax if their liability does not exceed $10,000 per annum. This is a considerable advance on the present concession, which is mainly limited to manufacturers and has a generally lower threshold. While the concession will be optional&mdash;some small businesses may wish not to take up the concession so that they may continue to acquire their business inputs free from tax&mdash;it is expected that a significant number of small businesses will avail themselves of the concession. This will result in savings to those businesses which will no longer be required to lodge returns and make small tax payments to the Australian Taxation Office. It will also reduce the costs of collecting the tax. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registration and Quotation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing law it is compulsory for persons liable to pay tax to be registered and quote their certificates of registration. This compulsion will be removed by this Bill. Registration of taxpayers will be optional, as will quotation by those who elect to be registered. This will remove the need for penalties for non-registration or for failure to quote a certificate. It will also relieve taxpayers from the threat of penalty in situations where they are not certain whether they should register or quote a certificate. However, because of the general advantages of registration it is expected that most taxpayers who are currently registered for sales tax will remain registered. Moreover, certain exemptions from tax in the area of business inputs will be restricted on purchase to registered persons. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conditional Exemption System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will provide a much simpler set of rules for persons who are currently entitled to exemption from sales tax and will continue to be under the new law. Such persons will, in some cases, be able to be registered and simply quote a sales tax registration number to obtain goods tax-free. In other cases they will quote in a similar fashion to the existing conditional exemption system except that there will be authority for it in the law. This will make quotation for persons entitled to exemption more certain. The new system will, however, impose a liability on any person who provides an incorrect certificate. This is considered appropriate bearing in mind that the person providing the certificate should be aware of the purpose of use of the goods and whether or not exemption applies. The new system will also benefit vendor taxpayers who will no longer have a liability if they accept an incorrect certificate in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Avoidance of Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the Government's policy to stamp out tax avoidance, the Bill will contain a general anti-avoidance provision to catch schemes designed to avoid the payment of sales tax. The general provision will replace a number of provisions that are directed to particular schemes but which do not cover the field of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Liability to Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic aim of the sales tax law is to impose a tax on  all goods going into use in Australia for the first time unless they are specifically exempted. There are some gaps in the present law in reaching this aim and the law is to be tightened in certain areas to ensure that all goods that should bear tax do so. This will be achieved by strengthening the provisions relating to royalties and catching certain manufacturing costs that presently fall outside the tax base.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, a liability will be imposed on the sale or use of goods that ordinarily would be subject to tax but somehow have managed to bypass a taxing point without payment of tax. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commissioner's Discretions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In revising the existing law, a significant number of Commissioner's discretions have been removed with the object of making the law more self-assessing. Commissioner's discretions have been retained only where it is essential for sound administration or to avoid the need for unduly complex law. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other changes to the law which will make it easier to follow. The rules relating to leases have been considerably simplified to bring them into line with sales of goods. A number of complex deeming provisions relating to the making-up of goods from materials supplied by a customer have been removed and replaced with a simpler system. There will be new rules for selling goods tax-free to Australian residents intending to travel overseas which will clarify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Summary</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the new law is a considerable simplification of the existing law there are still some areas which will remain reasonably complex. This is unavoidable with a wholesale tax that is imposed only on goods. However, it is the Government's position that in the field of indirect taxation it favours the present wholesale tax because it enables essential goods such as food and clothing to be exempted from the tax and it leaves important service industries which are vital to the growth of the economy, such as the tourist industry, largely free from tax. It is also much easier to collect, having far fewer collection points than a retail or general consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill not only simplifies a relatively complex taxation law but it represents a considerable advance in writing law in a plain English style that can be easily understood by the general public. The new law will not commence to impose tax until three months after it has received the royal assent. During this time the existing law will continue to apply. The delayed introduction will allow the Commissioner of Taxation sufficient time to publicise the changes to the existing law and to set in place the new arrangements that will be necessary for its administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, members of the simplification review will be making themselves available during this period to meet with key bodies and taxpayers' representatives to discuss the new law and to identify any concerns with it. The Government is aware that, in a project that has seen the complete restructuring and re-writing of the sales tax law, it is likely that some errors and unintended omissions or changes are unavoidable. These will only emerge after detailed analysis of the new law over an extended period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would particularly draw honourable members attention to the explanatory memorandum accompanying these Bills. While all of the changes made by the Bill are explained in detail in that document, the aim of the simplification review has not merely been to improve the sales tax law but also to improve the traditional explanatory materials brought forward to explain it. One example of this is the explanatory memorandums for these Bills. They have been specially designed, after discussions with representatives of their users, to meet concerns expressed about the structure and shortcomings of earlier explanatory memorandums. In particular, the memorandums seek to provide, in a form easily accessed by all users, a detailed explanation of all the changes proposed to the existing law as well as the reasons for those changes. Recent advances in computer technology now enable far more professionally presented and better structured material to be brought forward. Maximum use has been made of this technology by the review team. I also note that there is a separate explanatory memorandum which sets out quite comprehensive tables which identify where provisions of the existing law are dealt with in the new law, and vice versa. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is part of a package of six Bills that make up the new simplified sales tax law. Its purpose is to provide for the necessary transitional arrangements that are essential to ensure a smooth change over from the existing law to the new law. More specifically, the Bill will terminate the old law from the day before the first taxing day under the new law. It will provide that in certain situations goods taxed under the existing law will not be taxed under the new law. Where goods can be taxed under both the existing and new law a credit will be available for tax paid under the existing law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reduce the burden on taxpayers who are presently registered for sales tax from applying for fresh registration under the new law, there will be provision for existing registrations to continue.

A further transitional provision will preserve the operation of the current small business exemptions to ensure that no small business is disadvantaged by the changeover to the new law. The Bill also covers other minor transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the event that there are some matters not adequately covered by the transitional provisions, there is power for regulations to be made to deal with them.

The Government has continued to build on these reforms with the objective of making the tax system fairer and more efficient. The 1988 business tax reforms further encouraged economic efficiency.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reasonable Care and Reasonably  Arguable Position</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole idea of the new understatement penalties is to ensure that people do not get penalised when they have made an honest and genuine attempt to correctly determine their taxable income. The Bill replaces the existing system where penalty is automatically attracted at the rate of 200 per cent and remitted at the discretion of the Commissioner. In so doing, it reduces the risk of penalties for taxpayers, provided taxpayers adhere to the standards of reasonable care and, where appropriate, reasonably arguable position. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasonable care standard requires a taxpayer to exercise the care that an ordinary person would be likely to have exercised in the circumstances of the taxpayer. Reasonable care requires taxpayers to make a reasonable attempt to comply with their tax obligations. The effort required is commensurate with all the taxpayer's circumstances, including the taxpayer's knowledge, education and skill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has opted to favour equity in this area by choosing a standard which has regard to the taxpayer's circumstances. However, following experience in the United States, the Government considers it appropriate that a more rigorous standard apply where the item at issue is very large, for example, generally more than $10,000 in tax. Where the interpretation of the law for such large items is in issue, we expect taxpayers to exercise more care; that is, the taxpayer must have a reasonably arguable position on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasonably arguable position standard will, because of the $10,000 threshold, apply only to relatively few taxpayers. The crux of the standard is that taxpayers should not take positions at law which, at the time taken, are not about as arguable as an alternative position. All said and done, the standard is about analysing the law and its application to the facts. If there is a strong argument to support the taxpayer's position, that may be enough. However, the Government does not want taxpayers to take positions which are not defensible or which do not have reasonable prospects of success. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pending the outcome of that review, and as an interim measure to protect the revenue, the Bill maintains the current position that a taxpayer is liable to penalties for understatements of tax caused by the negligent or delinquent behaviour of the tax agent in dealing with the taxpayer's affairs.

I think there is one Bill which is outside that consideration, but basically that is the position that has been put upon us.

All these Bills are matters of great moment to this nation. They must get through this session and they must get to the Senate on a timetable which the Senate finds acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I firstly make reference to the remarks the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) made about my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), who is not in the chamber. We are all saddened to see that he is not here, but his service is not lost to us. One of the things he said to me when I took on this job was to make sure, when the guillotine comes up, that I tell them what I really think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we have had to repeat this speech over a considerable period of time, the intensity with which we deliver it has not been diminished by the number of times we have had to deliver it. I cannot hear the interjections, but I am sure that if the honourable member seeks leave of the Chair to speak at a later time probably he will be given that indulgence and I will have the chance to answer him then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House knows that the question of the guillotine is not so much a matter of saying, `It is regrettable that we have to come forward again' and, `It is all the fault of the Senate' and, `These matters have to be dealt with', as indeed they do. But it really comes down to a matter of management of the business of the House. Indeed, it is a broader issue than just the management of the House. It is really a management of the Cabinet. Part of the problem is, of course, that the legislation&mdash;there have been several years now of this position arising&mdash;needs to go through the legislative committees of Cabinet at a far speedier pace in order that it may be brought to this place so that honourable members on both sides of the chamber may have the opportunity to debate it at length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to sit until after midnight for three nights this week, and that is not acceptable. We are also going to be guillotined or gagged, and a number of honourable members who might want to speak on these Bills will not be able to do so. Last November we saw 37 Bills in four days subjected to the urgency motion. Today there are over 17. Later in the week, I understand, there will be even more, with the momentous tax changes that the Government is proposing. We must be concerned about the short-circuiting of the legislative process that this motion envisages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago the Leader of the House provided some figures to my colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). I have been looking at these figures, and they will be instructive for the House. From 1976 to 1982 there were only 17 Bills declared urgent. During the period this Government has been in office, from 1983 to the end of 1991, there have been 401 Bills declared urgent. The Leader of the House has already put forward some reasons for that, but that does not explain it completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period of the predecessor to the present Leader of the House, we see that not nearly so many Bills were declared urgent as there have been under the current stewardship. The number has increased, and 1991 was the winning year for the number of Bills declared urgent and forced through this place. The curve goes ever upwards under the present Leader of the House who, because of the way he forces legislation through, would have to be described as the axeman of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us know the pressures that are upon the Parliament, but there is nothing more precious in this country than having the opportunity to deal in some detail with complex legislation. On the list of Bills before us today we see that a number of them are extremely important in terms of export opportunities for this country. Coal, wool and dairying feature quite prominently, together with some transport and communications legislation. Here we have three specific major items of export earning that are very important for this country, and very important for the producers in those industries. The lack of opportunity, particularly for honourable members on this side of the House, to discuss in detail the impacts of the dairy industry changes and the impacts of changes on the coal mining industry&mdash;one of our largest exporters&mdash;is deplorable. Putting all the primary industry Bills together and having them driven through this House delivers a broader message. Part of the message is that the Government does not want the Opposition to detail the failure of the Government's policies as they relate to these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a management process breakdown. We are seeing the Parliament used as a cipher. We are seeing it used for the benefit of the Executive rather than for the benefit for which it was established, and that is to be a debating forum in which both sides of the Parliament are given an opportunity to explore in depth particular issues as they relate to major pieces of legislation. The Leader of the House himself just said that these were major pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is the trend that ought to be concerning all of my colleagues. In 1991, 101 Bills were declared urgent and the guillotine was applied, and we are going to see it happen again later this week. It ought to give us all cause for some concern. It is not something that ought to be an enduring feature of this Parliament. Regardless of which side of the chamber we sit on, we cannot take pride in this process. We are denying the people we represent the opportunity to have their views expressed. That is why the parliamentary process was established. Surely it is time for the Leader of the House&mdash;whoever that person might be&mdash;to take hold of this issue and to look at changes, which are obviously extremely necessary. The Opposition opposes the use of the guillotine each time it is proposed, and we will do so again this evening, because it ought to be opposed. We stand for the broader principle of detailed, open and lengthy debate. We do not wish to see these matters pass through the House in the way proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last night, after having read the Standing Orders for the fourth time in one day, I was reading an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine. The front cover of the magazine tells a story. It talks about Labor's identity crisis. The feature article makes the point that the Labor Party is not as relevant as it was to the people who have traditionally supported it. When we ask why we are having these important Bills rushed through the House, and why debate is being denied, we have to understand the broader political objective that is being pursued here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party recognises that it is becoming increasingly irrelevant to the broad population. In trying to ensure that Bills that have a major impact on the rural community are not subject to major debate, the Government has come up with the solution to gag this chamber and to stop democracy working. It is grappling with its own identity crisis and the uncertainty of how to deal with it, and the ills of the policies that it is visiting upon the Australian community. It is all part of the overall Labor Party political dilemma. I think that in part explains why we are seeing more and more abuses of the normal forms of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make an appeal, and perhaps pose a challenge to the Leader of the House: even he must admit that the procedures which he and the Cabinet are following are denying honourable members&mdash;including those on the Government side&mdash;the opportunity to discuss these weighty matters. The Government has political problems. We hope they continue. Ultimately they will be the cause of its demise. But each and every one of us in this place does have an obligation to ensure that the Standing Orders&mdash;imperfect though they be in many ways&mdash;are not used and abused in a way that is going to deny the fundamental right, regardless of which party we represent, that each and every one of us ought to be able to pursue in this place, and that is to have open and reasonable debate. This motion by its very nature denies that. That is why the Opposition yet again will be opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) in opposing the guillotine motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) here today. The Leader of the House is getting very good at and very used to moving this motion. He has been doing it regularly since he became the Leader of the House&mdash;far more so than any former Leader of the House in the history of the House of Representatives. The honourable member for Bass has highlighted the number of times this Government has introduced the guillotine, and compared it to the previous coalition Government. It is also worth going back a little bit further in history and discovering that only once during the Menzies years of government did the number of times the guillotine was imposed exceed double figures. Indeed, only once was it used during the post-Menzies years prior to the Whitlam Government coming into power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So up until more recent years the guillotine has been a very rare and unusual event in this Parliament. But increasingly under this Government we have seen it become the order of the day. It tells us a story that the Leader of the House tries to fudge. He blames all the problems that have led to the introduction of the guillotine on the Senate, and on the requirement that the House of Representatives conclude its business for the consideration of the Senate some time in advance of the Senate's rising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he is not really telling the full story there. As we all know, the mismanagement of the affairs of the House of Representatives is the principal reason why the guillotine is applied so frequently today. This mismanagement has extended beyond just the affairs of the House of Representatives to the affairs of the nation. It is for that reason that we have such things as one million unemployed persons in Australia today, that we have such disastrous levels of business investment, that the economy is not growing and that rural communities are as badly off as they are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the mismanagement of the Government, which is reflected in the state of the Australian economy and in our society, which permeates its way right through the system, even into the management of the House of Representatives. This Government&mdash;formerly the Hawke-Keating Government and, in the last six months, the Keating Government&mdash;has no respect for the norms of our Parliament or the institutions of our society. The Parliament is the most important institution in our society today. It is the symbol of our democracy. It is the thing that people look towards for good and proper government and for fairness. Unfortunately, it would appear from the way this Government tries to deny people the opportunity of free speech that those people can be disappointed as to the level of democracy they are getting from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guillotine motion that has been moved this evening denies members of the House of Representatives their right to speak on issues that they believe to be important to them and to their constituents. It means that the institution of the Parliament, the symbol of our democracy, the thing that guides our country, is being broken up by this Government. It is, of course, not just that institution of the Parliament that this Government is trying to erode; it is so many other institutions&mdash;the flag, the Queen or any other important symbol&mdash;in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only institutions that these people in the Labor Government believe are important are the institutions of mateship and factions. It is that mateship and those factions which are leading to so many of Australia's problems. We have seen in the last few weeks Senator Richardson being forced to resign over his mateship arrangements with so many others. I am sure we will see more of that type of thing over the weeks and months to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of the guillotine into the House, we see the sort of hypocrisy that we have become used to. When the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) became Prime Minister we heard him tell us he was going to give us a better standard and that he himself was going to improve his own personal performance. We heard Mr Hawke tell us after the 1990 election that he was going to improve the standards of the Parliament. What have we seen? We have seen the standards of the Parliament further eroded by the actions of this Government, be it in the introduction of the guillotine or even throughout Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time we continually see the erosion of the parliamentary democracy that we believe to be important. Today in Question Time we have five or six questions, if we are lucky, asked on behalf of the Opposition. In times gone past, when I first came into the House, it was not unusual for the Opposition to ask nine or 10 questions during Question Time. Those nine or 10 questions were dealt with in 45 minutes. The five or six&mdash;or at the very best, seven&mdash;questions that the Opposition can ask during a Question Time today take up to an hour and a quarter for the Government to answer. There is no doubt at all that Question Time is being eroded and that the standards of the Parliament during Question Time are being made a farce because of the way this Government treats the institution of our Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all symbolised by the way this Government runs Question Time and by the way it brings into the House these dozens of Bills which will be debated in a short space of time, denying honourable members&mdash;elected representatives of the people&mdash;the opportunity to speak on those issues which are important to them. It is for that reason that I am pleased that the Opposition will oppose, as it has for so long now, the guillotine motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to changes that have already been made to the rural adjustment scheme, the RAS as it is commonly known, through an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. Under section 27 of the Act these amendments can be introduced prior to an amendment of legislation to allow much faster assistance for farmers who are in dire financial straits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assistance is certainly desperately needed but, unfortunately, still desperately inadequate. The rural adjustment scheme has become increasingly necessary under the Federal Labor Government due to a string of failed, and failing, Labor Party policies. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) induced this recession that we had to have by propping up the Australian dollar, promoting high interest rates such as this country has never seen before and failing to implement a comprehensive tax and economic reform package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has failed in its waterfront reform; it has failed to implement effective anti-dumping legislation; and it has failed to instigate an industrial relations policy that promotes reward, incentive and productivity. The result is a depression in the bush, unprecedented since the Great Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in the House tonight. He is issuing press releases saying that the Government is spending more money&mdash;and in the next 12 months, over the full year, more than $60m of new money will be spent on rural assistance. That money is certainly welcome, but I think it begs the question: why is the provision of such amounts necessary?  It is necessary because of the failings of nine years of Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live on the driest continent on earth, yet this Government has failed to recognise that droughts occur in Australia. Mention of drought or severe drought has been removed from the national disaster relief legislation. On the one hand the Government recognises cyclones, floods and earthquakes under this legislation but does not recognise drought or even severe drought. I have to ask the Minister why. On the other hand, we on this side of the House can, and do, recognise extreme drought as a phenomenon, as something that Australia does go through and will continue to go through because it is one of the consequences of living on the driest continent on earth. We will ensure that under the national disaster relief legislation droughts will be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme has become an elastic bandaid, a means by which the Government can hide its successive failures. Unfortunately, the bandaid has now fouled and the rural adjustment scheme really is in need of major surgery if it is to address the problems that will confront agriculture in the next five to 10 years. We do not need another bandaid added to the already overburdened rural adjustment scheme which is trying to cope with the problems in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Testament to the failure of the rural adjustment scheme is the fact that of the $10m set aside this financial year to assist farmers to gain the unemployment benefit through modification of the Job Search allowance, only $200,000 has been expended at this stage. This Government cannot even spend the allocated amount of money on a very specific targeted assistance project. Why not?  Farmers in my electorate and across many electorates, including those of honourable members on the other side of the House, are also asking why not. I say it is because of poor policy making and lack of thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is in the House tonight, promised, alongside the now fallen Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, on 29 October last year that 2,000 desperate farmers would receive assistance through the Government's reformed Job Search allowance. As a matter of interest, I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy may have made that statement in Toowoomba, just on the edge of my electorate&mdash;probably one of the worst drought areas last year. That region suffered one of the worst droughts seen since records have been kept. At the end of April the number of farmers who were granted Job Search under the modified assets test arrangements totalled 101. Honourable members will remember that in October last year 2,000 farmers were going to receive this targeted assistance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After considering the criteria for eligibility the question is not why so few farmers took up the offer but why so many farmers did not meet such unrealistic and unbelievable requirements. Let me explain it to the Minister. The Job Search allowance does need modification&mdash;I think the Minister may be the first to agree&mdash;if this targeted assistance is to work and be directed to those very deserving farmers in desperate straits right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme is broken down into three components: part A, the interest subsidy component, part B, carry-on finance; and part C, household support and money to adjust out of farming. In order to be eligible for the Government's so-called farmer dole, the applicant must have no further borrowing capacity and must be considered viable in the long term. I am not sure how a farmer would meet both those criteria. If a farmer is to be viable in the long term, he or she is ineligible for the interest subsidy and forfeits any chance of accessing the unemployment benefit. Who, then, qualifies for the amended Job Search allowance? All available evidence suggests the benefit will be granted only in quite exceptional circumstances. I believe the fact that 101 farmers are receiving this assistance is testimony to that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us suppose for a moment that the Government's amended Job Search allowance did assist 2,000 farmers instead of the paltry 101 farmers who are receiving it now. Less than 4 per cent of farmers qualify for the unemployment benefit in the worst year on record for farm incomes and in the worst drought in many parts of the country since records have been kept. It is not hard to deduce from such figures that the Government's assistance program has failed completely. It has failed so many desperate farmers. I certainly have many of those in my electorate. I am sure that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), who has just come into the House, would understand what I am talking about because he would also have many farmers in desperate need for some income support at this very time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this failure down to the complete misunderstanding&mdash;perhaps ignorance&mdash;of this Labor Government. It does not understand the Australian farm sector, and I believe it does not want to understand it. If it did, this problem would have been addressed prior to Christmas last year. Had those in government listened to this side of the House and taken on board our proposals, this situation could have been averted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average Australian farmer is 57 years of age or, if we look at some other studies, 54 years of age. The Government's revised Job Search allowance takes no account of those farmers over the age of 65 years. Because they are of retirement age, they are deemed ineligible for the unemployment benefit. This is an example of how inappropriate it is to extend assistance to financially destitute farmers through the Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the Minister and the honourable member for Kennedy that many such farmers over the age of 65 are actively working their farms today. They are not thinking of retirement&mdash;they cannot afford to retire. They are desperate to hang onto their lifetime's work. They are also desperate to hang onto the family home. If they are forced off the land they will lose not only their lifetime's work, but also the family home and a roof over their head. To that group of farmers aged over 65 the Government is saying, `Tough luck, you are on the scrap heap. You cannot access the Job Search allowance or farmer dole schemes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments within this Bill also provide special assistance for crop planting. This assistance has been made available since March this year under part B of the scheme. This assistance is in the form of a 75 per cent interest subsidy on growers' commercial crop planting loans. When I first heard about it I thought&mdash;as did many farmers in my electorate&mdash;that this would be of some genuine help. It is certainly long overdue. Under the terms of the agreement with the States, farmers must be profitable in the long term but unable to obtain sufficient commercial carry-on finance to undertake normal cropping programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures to date show that only 160 out of an estimated 40,000 cereal and grain farmers across Australia have applied for the subsidies to help with winter wheat plantings due to the stringent requirements. I think many of them have been through the process already. They have been in to see their bankers and the rural adjustment authorities. I believe that, in many cases, even the rural adjustment authorities are saying, `Look, you are really better off going in and dealing with your bank. There is so much red tape I don't think you are going to qualify. You are really wasting your time and effort and that of your accountants in putting these figures together'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures confirm what we are saying about this scheme. Out of 160 applications, 67 have been approved, 29 have been rejected, and 64 are still pending. In fact, the Prime Minister's disregard for the problems forced on the rural sector was illustrated in his February economic statement. It is interesting to note the amount of money that was allocated for this scheme in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. I must say that if it were reasonably accessible to farmers it would be a tremendous help to them. But the unfortunate facts are&mdash;and this is supported by the figures&mdash;that farmers are not able to access that money because of the stringent requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to this point: the Prime Minister's statement in February allocated almost twice as much money to Western Australian sewage treatment than to the crop planting assistance program this year&mdash;$20m for a sewage treatment program in Western Australia and $10m this year and $6m next year to the crop planting scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an export industry which has the capacity to generate $2 billion to $3 billion worth of export income and create countless jobs right across Australia&mdash;not just on the farms, but on the wharves where the wheat is loaded, the railways which cart the wheat into the ports and for the truck drivers who bring it in from the farms. It is a great creator of jobs, yet so little of this assistance is flowing to the wheat and cereal growers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's message is quite clear: in times of financial crisis welfare payments cannot be extended to farming communities through unemployment benefits. Generally, the farmer and his spouse are actively employed on the property from daybreak to dusk, regardless of whether they receive any income. It is, therefore, not practical to offer the Job Search allowance as a means of assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The entire charade of Job Search allowance for farmers could have been avoided had the Government retained the 1977 coalition Government's decision to introduce household support as an income tested, but not work tested, welfare payment for a 12-month period, followed by a loan for a further 12 months. I am sure that answers the Minister's continued interjections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, because of its ignorance or bias, the Labor Government changed the whole concept to household support. It has engaged in an active policy of eliminating farmers and accelerating the rate at which many of them will be forced to leave the land. This decision resulted in a complete lack of welfare provisions for farming couples who wished to remain on the land, in contrast with the situation in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a terribly important point. Unemployment benefits are payable to a married couple in a city, no matter what the value of their residential property. On the other hand, a farming couple becomes ineligible for unemployment benefits once the value of their farm exceeds $157,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for fast track household support reform is therefore crucial if farming families are to keep food on the table and if the rural infrastructure is to survive this very desperate period. A coalition government would allow farmers to access the same benefits as every other Australian. The coalition recognises that there is a role for rural adjustment in Australia in order to assist the Australian agricultural sector in overcoming problems unique to it. We recognise the need for rural adjustment. There will probably always be a need for this rural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has created the majority of problems which are facing the farming sector today. It has attempted to gloss over these by forcing onto the rural adjustment authorities problems which have their beginnings in the Labor Party Caucus room. However, it could not get even this right and it bungled an ideal opportunity to provide assistance to farmers who are in genuine need. I go back to the Minister's statement and that of the now departed Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, who said that 2,000 farmers would access this modified Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of other problems that I think the Government must look at. It certainly must look at encouraging farmers to better manage their situations prior to drought, because one of the reasons why we have a rural adjustment scheme in place is that there is a lack of programs, programs which the coalition had in place to encourage farmers to put money aside in good times to see their way through the bad times and, more particularly, the droughts. In many cases the Government has taken such measures away. It is something that we must look at more closely and the Government must look at, because it obviously has the power of the treasury bench. We must look at assistance such as 100 per cent write-offs for grain and hay storage measures for drought mitigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, if we can give tax incentives for land care, we should also be able to give the equivalent tax write-off to encourage people to put these facilities in place so that they can store their fodder, which will better enable them to get through the droughts. Income equalisation deposits are a very important part of drought management strategy. From a government point of view, income equalisation deposits today are not effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect of this whole question of rural adjustment that I hope the Minister looks at. Rural adjustment really has been added onto, yet some of the problems that are still inherent out there in rural Australia are problems that rural adjustment cannot adequately cover. These include income equalisation deposits, the 100 per cent write-offs for drought mitigation measures for the storage of fodder, for increased water storage capacity and for the reticulation of water around farms to avoid many of the disasters that we have seen in the current drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the Government, the coalition does know and does have the understanding of the rural sector. It can solve the great many problems facing rural Australia today. We would be in there restoring farm profitability through the implementation of a comprehensive tax reform and economic package the like of which this country has never seen. We would have an effective industrial relations policy which would give reward for effort, which every Australian wants. We would encourage people to work. The more people work and the harder they work, the more they will earn to take home to their families. We would do that rather than continue the restrictive work practices that Government members have encouraged and nurtured for years and years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would certainly fast track the anti-dumping legislation which the Government has in place, because dumping contributes to the corrupt world trade and pricing mechanisms. Part of the problem the agricultural sector is confronted with today is ineffective anti-dumping legislation. The problem with our anti-dumping legislation is that it takes too long to implement. If we compare Australia with other countries, we find that we are in the Third World country area when it comes to anti-dumping. I say to the Minister that our anti-dumping policy would put countervailing duties into place much faster on those people who want to cheat our system and access our markets. It certainly would still allow those people who want to play the game and have fair trade to access our markets to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I do ask the Minister to look at the real problems confronting so many farming families right across Australia. We may have seen a return to some better prices in some commodities, but the problem that many farm families face today is one of walking off their farms with nothing to show for a lifetime's work. I believe it is up to each and every one of us in this House to look at how better to target the Job Search allowance and the whole rural adjustment scheme to assist those who are still in genuine need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, but after listening to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) I guess it is no wonder that rural Australians are turning to the Labor Party to protect their interests. In fact, if one looks at the rural areas of the Australian continent, one finds that something like 70 per cent of rural seats are now held by the Labor Party, and I expect that that will increase after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that people in rural Australia are indeed sick and tired of hearing coalition members, particularly National Party members, telling farmers in rural Australia that they will look after them when they know full well that the coalition's Fightback package, with its blanket commitment to zero tariffs and a crippling 15 per cent goods and services tax, will devastate many if not most farmers. I guess it is fair to say that farmers are sick and tired of being taken for fools by coalition members who tell them one thing in the bush and then do something completely different here in Canberra. Opposition members should note the comments of the National Farmers Federation, which, in a media release on 17 April of this year referring specifically to this States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New provisions within the rural adjustment scheme of debt reconstruction and interest subsidies could be particularly helpful.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is on top of the NFF's decision&mdash;appropriate decision, I might say&mdash;not to specifically endorse any political party at the next election, and on top of a statement some time ago by Mr Rick Farley, the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of farmers wouldn't like to admit it, but the best thing that has happened is Labor winning regional seats. This has widened the policy scope of the Labor Party to give greater consideration to regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that comment has been endorsed as recently as today by a leading north Queensland sugar industry figure, Mr Leo Donadelli, from the Proserpine Cooperative Sugar Milling Association, who has described the coalition's policy as it relates specifically to the sugar industry as `disgusting'. On ABC radio this morning, after saying he was disgusted with the coalition's policy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I asked Mr Fischer, he's the leader of the National Party, the Federal Leader, when he was here,. . . "what are they going to do about the tariffs?" He said oh well, we'll certainly have a good look at them and see what we can do about it, but now they're quite openly saying that they agree that they should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder the National Farmers Federation does not want to support the National Party. No wonder rural Australia is deserting the National Party in droves. The Party that continually says one thing in the bush and does the exact opposite in Canberra cannot and will not be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion&mdash;I understand the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) wants to respond in relation to this matter&mdash;it is fair to say that this Bill, which deals with the rural adjustment scheme, is proof of this Government's commitment to rural Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;No amendments are proposed to the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill, but there are a couple of issues which I think need to be taken up. Firstly, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) really was very selective in terms of his reporting of access to certain programs. When the entitlement to special unemployment benefit was introduced, it was introduced as a safety net. It was introduced as a safety net because I was told as Minister that the people who were losing out were those who fell between part B and part C of the rural adjustment scheme, people who were viable long term but who could not incur any further debt. The reason the new scheme was introduced was that it was to cover that group of persons. It was introduced at a time in which the drought had not broken, in which interest rates were significantly higher, in which no progress was being made on the world stage so far as access was concerned, and in which prices for commodities were still at very low levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that changed in the next couple of months. Whilst it is true that between 100 and 200 people have been able to access this, only 500 have applied and some 100 of those have been referred to additional assistance under other forms of RAS. The other point I make is that 4,200 spouses of farm families are in receipt of the unemployment benefit through the normal procedures in recognition of hardship. So those opposite cannot say that the scheme is applicable only in the urban centres and not in the bush; that distorts the picture. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the Government's record in this area, it is not at all difficult to understand why the Government is so keen to truncate debate in this vital area. After nine years of Labor in office, the young people of Australia are among the least skilled in the Western world. They are unemployed for longer at comparable stages of the business cycle than are their peers in other countries. More than one in three of them are unable to find work and perhaps as many as 200,000 who wish to upgrade their knowledge and skills at either university or TAFE are unable to gain a place at these institutions even though they are fully qualified to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government justifies its performance in education and training by pointing to the increased retention rates in the post-compulsory years of schooling and the increased participation rates in tertiary education and training. There is no doubt that rates of retention and participation have increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things to be said about this: the first is that the increasing commitment by Australians to education predates this Government and will continue after the Government's eviction from office at the next election. In many ways it is the tragic failure of the Government's economic policy, leading to unprecedented levels of unemployment, which has forced the most dramatic increase in retention and participation. In other respects increased rates reflect the operation of forces beyond the Government's control. Even so, they are still below international levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that throughout this period the Government has been concerned with quantity rather than quality. The level of community concern at the state of Australian education and training has risen to the point where education is now second only to unemployment as a problem area that the Federal Government is being called upon to address&mdash;and to address in very different ways from the policies that this Government has pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address my remarks firstly to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. This Bill seeks to put in place increased capital grants to non-government schools. The proposed increase of $15m is manifestly inadequate in terms of the needs of these schools. The National Catholic Education Commission, whose schools accommodate some 20 per cent of all enrolments, has estimated its capital requirements for projects already planned in the four years 1991 to 1995 at $635m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment contrasts starkly with that of the coalition which, in its Fightback program, has committed itself to double capital grants for non-government schools, including an additional $81m in 1993-94 compared with an additional $8m in One Nation. The coalition's commitment has been welcomed by the National Catholic Education Commission, the National Council of Independent Schools Association and, indeed, most of those in the non-government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken by Labor to the non-government school sector in the past nine years has been driven by political ideology which is unwaveringly hostile to the concept of non-government schools. Given that some 28 per cent of enrolments are in the non-government sector&mdash;that is, more than one-quarter of all families exercise their right to choose an alternative to government schooling for their children&mdash;the consequences of that ideology impact adversely on a sizeable proportion of the electorate. Ultimately, it is parents&mdash;and in the systemic schools parents and parishes&mdash;that must shoulder the extra burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a myth peddled by Labor that the non-government sector is somehow, to use the Government's preferred pejorative, elitist. There is ample evidence to show that children in the non-government sector come from families spanning the entire socioeconomic spectrum. In total, it is estimated that the operation of non-government schools reduces public outlays on education by some $1.6 billion annually. It is therefore easy to see what a drain there would be on the public purse&mdash;and a public purse already dangerously depleted and running into dangerously high deficits at present&mdash;if the students currently attending non-government schools were to attend government schools. There is a clear irrationality in current policies, such as the new schools policy, which aim to limit the right of parents to choose the school which reflects their values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition are unequivocal in our view that support for students attending non-government schools is a matter of basic equity and justice. The Commonwealth funding programs for non-government schools are a key expression of that view. Unless proper guarantees of support for non-government schools can be given in a rearrangement of Commonwealth-State relations, this program must remain a central element in any policy to ensure the reality of parental choice. We are also conscious of the role of the government school funding program in providing a balanced program of school support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-government schools can prosper only when they have secure long term funding and a high degree of financial independence, including the right to work to improve the level of provision without penalty, the right to independence in the management of the school and the right to establish objectives and to give expression to a system of values and a curriculum attractive to those who choose the school from amongst those available. An environment which adequately supports these conditions does not exist in Australia today. Despite this, DEET projections indicate that the non-government sector is still expected to grow significantly faster than the government sector, showing the demand that exists from parents seeking schooling that reflects their values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback package, the coalition has provided a comprehensive plan for schooling in this country, government and non-government, which will resource schooling, government and non-government, at levels significantly above those levels currently planned or projected by the Labor Government. Central to that policy is the right of parents in both sectors to exercise choice in the school to which they send their child. In the non-government sector, in addition to the doubling of capital grants, there will be very significant increases in the per capita grants to students attending all categories of non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are signs that the Government is receiving advice to abandon its restrictive new schools policy. Will it heed the advice&mdash;for example, the criticism in the Hudson report; indeed, every report that the Government receives on education and training seems to strike at the heart of the Government's policy&mdash;or is the Government a prisoner of the restrictive political ideology which seeks to inhibit diversity and constrain choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's record in the schools field does not withstand close scrutiny. It is a matter of public record that Commonwealth assistance for non-government school building projects has decreased steadily since Labor came to office. The annual total of Commonwealth capital grants has declined in real terms by 12 per cent during the life of this Government. When the grant is expressed in dollars per student in non-government schools the decrease is 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shortfall in meeting the demand for capital funding is well illustrated by the experience of Catholic schools in 1990, which submitted 329 applications for assistance, with the funding of building projects seeking grants totalling $169m. The block grant authorities which administer the capital grants program were able to recommend to the Minister only 117 projects for total grants of $49m, that is, only 29 per cent. These demands come not from schools which draw their students from high income backgrounds but from schools whose overwhelming majority of students come from low income families&mdash;schools in the needs categories 10, 11 and 12 under current arrangements. I foreshadow at this point that at the end of my speech I will be moving a second reading amendment to this Bill in accordance with the terms now being circulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, in which there is a furtherance of Labor's ideological theme to seek to curb diversity and impose control from the centre. It is here in higher education that this thinking has had perhaps its most disastrous, and certainly its most visible, consequences. Few people would pretend to argue that our higher education system in any respect resembles sound health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's report on higher education released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Universities in a Changing World</EMPHASIS>, which was quoted at length in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review,</EMPHASIS> reveals the depth of concern higher education has about threats to and attacks on its quality. The rigid ideological adherence to an over-regulated system and the funding arrangements which have been criticised as fundamentally flawed by the Industry Commission have as their own disgraceful monument the 50,000 qualified young Australians who are locked out not only of higher education but of opportunity because of this politically imposed rigidity. But will the Government be relaxing its regulatory approach? No, of course it will not; and, even worse, it promises more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor McKinnon, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, has expressed his concern that the Government is about to intervene even further in trying to impose new commencement quotas forcing universities to allocate a specific quota of places to school leavers, mature age students and postgraduates. Of course, this is the quick fix at work again&mdash;a piece of politicking that sweeps aside any pretence of developing a workable and viable strategy for the development of higher education in favour of being seen to be getting more people into the universities in an election year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strikes at the very heart of the problem, because what we have in higher education now is an artificial shortage of places, created by political and bureaucratic regulation and interference. It will not be solved by more of the same. In fact, such an approach will only worsen the situation, create further distortions and place intolerable burdens on the already overstretched resources of the universities. It is abundantly clear that the Government's current arrangements, arrangements which underlie every aspect of this legislation, cannot adequately provide for the rational development of the system of university funding in Australia. Both the November statement and the One Nation statement comprehensively fail to address any of the structural impediments which have resulted in the unprecedented levels of unmet demand in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Government to provide adequate tertiary places, both at university and at TAFE, remains a serious obstacle to achieving and to increasing skill levels in the labour force, with probable consequences for unemployment in an internationally competitive environment. The OECD country study of Australia noted, as many have before it, that skill levels here are generally lower than in other industrialised countries and that Australia's backwardness in this area&mdash;a backwardness marked internationally and underlined by the OECD after nine years of Labor&mdash;may account for the longer duration of unemployment here compared with Canada and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no abstract statistical observation. It is cogent evidence that the people of Australia, and especially the young, are paying an unacceptably high price for the monumental failings of this Government. The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, but it is my intention to move a second reading amendment in the terms which are now being circulated. I shall move that amendment at the appropriate stage of the debate later this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will turn to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. This Bill is intended to appropriate funds for TAFE in accordance with the November statement on the economy and employment and to provide supplementation of grants for 1992. It is instructive to measure what the Government is saying about TAFE and training against what it is actually proposing, and therein, of course, lies a staggering mismatch. It is by now quite clear that the Government is struggling to achieve some finality in its policy on TAFE as a result of the unwillingness of the States to agree to the Government's proposals in One Nation to hand over the TAFE systems to the Commonwealth. The Government, of course, will deny that this is what it is proposing, but if people believe that 100 per cent Commonwealth funding means anything other than 100 per cent Commonwealth control over TAFE, they are only deceiving themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Premiers last met they were not prepared to do what the Federal Government was suggesting, that is, hand over to the Commonwealth all the resources that they devote to TAFE in order to obtain the increment that the Government is proposing. They naturally questioned whether this was a very good deal from their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what the Government proposes as a fall-back option is yet to be revealed, but let me say at this point that the coalition has been explicit and up-front about its proposals. It has on the table as part of Fightback a comprehensive funded strategy to create an open and flexible training market. There is nothing conditional in our approach. We have accepted the targets for growth in TAFE as outlined in the Finn report, and we will in government work with and not against the States and Territories to ensure greater resourcing and greater freedom for TAFE institutions to respond to the needs of local industry and local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has left it very late in the day to discover TAFE. For far too long it has been the neglected child of education and training. The Government has been far too preoccupied with its vandalism of higher education to be concerned with TAFE. Again, this failing has impacted most heavily on young people, who now find themselves, if they have jobs, largely under-skilled in terms of international comparisons or in the dole queues at the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the OECD, which in its economic survey recognised the deficiencies in the Government's approach. It cites insufficient skills or greater skill mismatches as a contributing factor to extended unemployment. Further, participation rates in post-compulsory education amongst 18- to 19-year-olds are lower in Australia than in the United Kingdom or New Zealand, and Australia generally lags behind comparable estimates in America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is lagging badly in education and training behind those countries which are now our international competitors. We are lagging both in the commitment to education measured by participation rates and in the quality of the education which is being offered. Even though participation rates have been on the rise, we are still well behind other comparable countries in the proportion of young people in formal education and training. For example, West Germany in 1987-88 had more than 65 per cent of 18- to 19-year-old males in education and training; the USA had 58 per cent; Japan, 50 per cent; Sweden, 43 per cent; and Australia, 30 per cent. It is no wonder that the OECD reports that much remains to be done to improve labour force skills in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, but again I propose to move a second reading amendment, which is now being circulated. The Bills now before the House are from a Government which has manifestly and comprehensively failed to develop a strategy and a framework on which we as a nation can upgrade our education and our skills in a manner appropriate to an internationally competitive economy in the late twentieth century. In stark contrast to the coalition, the Government has failed to give education and training the priority that it requires. Within the Fightback program we have shown that it is possible to deliver the vast majority of the services and programs of the Commonwealth Government, much more efficiently, with better quality, at lower cost than is being done at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that over the rest of this decade, however, there is scope for increased investment in education and training by the taxpayer and the private sector. We are able to reflect that priority because we have taken an attitude that government spending requires rigorous review and that there has to be a genuine effort to set proper priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government stands condemned for its approach to education and training as a playground for experiments in social engineering; it has used it as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of the accord. It has left a mess in its wake. It decided that universities were elitist, so it wilfully dismantled the system of vocationally oriented colleges of advanced education and turned them into universities. It decided that non-government schools were elitist and sought to curb their expansion and growth at great cost to the public purse. It has neglected TAFE and allowed our skills base to decline to a standard perilously close to the Third World. As policy failures, they are as bad as they come.

I remind this House yet again that the majority of Queenslanders over 42 years of age have not enjoyed the benefits of a high school education, let alone a tertiary education. Opposition members may well ask why. It was due to 30 years of neglect by a government that believed that education was the hallmark for the privileged, that it was only for those who could pay. The other great attribute of that government was that it believed that education was not necessary for anybody, because people could rip off the system and make money; if they could rip off other people and get into government, they could stay there, and they did not need an education for that. Apart from that, if people were educated, they might actually question what that government was doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tory members in this House have talked about education and decried the Government's role in education and the extension of the retention rates in our secondary schools and our universities. I remind members of the Opposition that in this Government's term of office, in but a decade, we have created an extra 17 universities with extra places. That is no small achievement. But the Opposition has to deride that. It has to deride our youth. We have heard it cite the most ridiculous unemployment figures as reasons for people staying on at school and going to university. Why should people not make a willing choice to stay on in the secondary school system and make a choice to go to university? `Oh no', the Opposition says, `Nobody would do that. They are forced into it by a whole load of factors'. That is a nonsense. </PARA>

She said, `I will be derided by my other Party members, but I have to speak up and I have to be honest'. For the first time in our history, we have a government that reflects the concerns of the community and is about a share for all.

We know why the Opposition is concerned about the non-government schools and wishes to change its categories. It is because we do not fund those rich private schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in this cognate debate on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, it is important that I comment on tonight's speech by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) because, quite clearly, she does not understand&mdash;obviously she has not read the coalition's policy&mdash;the Opposition's position on this matter. The honourable member spoke about the rich. I presume she understands that there are double the number of children from rich families attending government schools as there are attending private schools in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party's policy position is that it is more important to subsidise rich people than to provide for better education. The honourable member for Forde indicated in her speech that it is more important to subsidise a whole range of rich families in terms of education. That is nonsense. The coalition's policy provides freedom of choice to parents as to where to send their children. The fundamental issue is not whether a school is rich or parents are rich; it is whether parents have the choice to send their children to the school of their choice. Under Labor that choice is very much restricted because of its new schools policy which prevents parents from establishing new schools in Australia and so denies them the choice. The honourable member's comments in that respect have no basis at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also said that the Government wants to provide access to tertiary institutions to all students and there are now 50,000 to 70,000 students who are unable to get in. The Government says that it wants to provide access. Why has it not achieved it? Never in Australia's history has there been more money going to be injected into education than under Fightback. There will be $2 billion more for new programs over and above the present Government's projections. No matter what the Government says about it, that is the biggest injection  of money into education that Australia has seen. The coalition has a very clear policy on this&mdash;that is, until we pump more money into education to enable people to be better educated, the competitive edge of Australia will not improve in global world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing which has to be said in regard to funding and providing places is that the Government's One Nation strategy is unfunded. Where is the money coming from? It is not available. In addition, over the last five or six years the Government's policies have got so off track that there has been a built-up need for more money in education. Because the economy is so off track&mdash;instead of a Budget deficit of $4.7 billion it is going to be $9.3 billion&mdash;we cannot provide for the impetus of the retention of young people in our schools going on to tertiary institutions. If the Government had set the economy in place, it would have had the money to do that. However, that is the reality; that is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government's economic policies had been correct, the money would have flowed into the Government. The retention rate has improved and we support that. Contrary to what has been said, we do not decry retention rates. We are pleased that there are more young people being retained in our schools, but they have to be provided for when they go on to tertiary education. This Government did not have the foresight to provide the financial assistance so that could be achieved. In addition, the administrative arrangements which the Government wants to apply in the tertiary sector mean that it will control the university campuses. The Government wants to dictate to the university vice-chancellors as to how they will run their institutions&mdash;as if that will give the best advantage to Australian university students. That is the reality and it simply does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way we will provide better opportunities for young people and the only way universities will use the funds which this Parliament provides for education at the tertiary sector is to allow those institutions greater freedom to do so in the best possible fashion. The Government believes that these things can be controlled from a centralised bureaucracy out of Canberra; that the conditions in Tasmania, Western Australia, northern Queensland or the Northern Territory are similar and that it can dictate to each individual institution from a centralised control system. We know that that does not work and that the universities do not want it, that they want more freedom. I am absolutely certain that, given more freedom, they can drive the taxpayers' dollar much further. The coalition's policies will give them that freedom so that they can drive the taxpayers' dollar further and not be hemmed in by the Government's industrial approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a vitriolic attack on the coalition for seeking to provide extra money to private schools. What is wrong with providing extra money and a doubling of funding to private schools for capital works? At present the Government provides $81m. Under our Fightback program we will provide $162m. Obviously the Government does not want that money to go to the private school sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating cognately three different education Bills: the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. All these Bills involve additional expenditure on education, particularly in the higher education field. I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). I would like to correct some of the points that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I think a few facts need to be brought to the attention of the House with regard to the performance of the Government in the last eight or nine years in the higher education sector. Listening to what the honourable member for Braddon had to say, one would have thought there had been no growth at all. Yet when we look at education in this country, we see that there has been massive growth in higher education and in tertiary places funded by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some statistics. The number of students at Australian universities has increased from 348,000 in 1983 to 534,500 in 1991&mdash;a massive increase in the number of tertiary places available to Australian students. A continuing growth in student numbers is proposed&mdash;a further 25,000 between 1992 and 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth funding through the Department of Employment, Education and Training has increased by $1.2 billion or 41 per cent in real terms in that period. No-one could disagree that that is a significant increase in funding for the higher education sector in particular. A further $300m, or 7.2 per cent, in real terms is planned over the next two years. Capital funding is up by 444 per cent and research funding is up by 260 per cent. How anyone can say that this Government has not substantially increased the amount of money allocated to education is beyond me. The figures stand for themselves and prove that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we have the line being used that 50,000 applications for university places could not be met this year, it ignores the fundamental reason behind that: too many students are applying for tertiary places when in fact they should be seeking places in the vocational education and training field. It is in that area that this Government is determined to address the needs of those students who are applicants for places, and it is in that area that the country needs to progress and develop considerably. The major focus for all education debate in the next two to three years in this country is what we are going to do for the vocational education and training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 months in particular three important reports which have come out have addressed the developing needs in the vocational education and training sector. First of all, we had the Finn committee report. Subsequent to that I and my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) had some part to play in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The Committee came down with a very important report which brought together a lot of the different threads of the debate about vocational education and training. We then had the release of the Carmichael report, which was also a very important contribution to the debate, about where we are going in apprenticeship training and vocational education and training in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee recommended a number of important things: an expansion of training on a nationally consistent basis into areas not traditionally training oriented and the development of a single integrated entry level training system which would provide enhanced career opportunities for the great majority of young people who are not bound for university, and that is a very important point. Most of the 50,000 people who applied for university we do not really want to go to university. We do not need that number of university graduates each year in this country. We need people who are trained and who have the skills and the vocational education and training to fit into the work force. We do not need a massive oversupply of university graduates; we want skilled workers to fulfil the needs of our developing economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee also recommended the development of a wider training market outside the public sector which, subject to assurances about quality and standards, will provide even greater training opportunities. That is an important point because it is clear that the existing TAFE system in this country is not able to meet the demands that are being placed on it now and will continue to be placed on it. We need to support some growth in the private training sector to accommodate the needs of those young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to deliberately embark on encouraging recognition of the importance of vocational education to correct the imbalance which exists at the moment and which ignores and devalues a significant proportion of the skills and knowledge held by people who have gone through the TAFE sector. That is an important point to make. A very low number of people seek to go into TAFE because people do not believe TAFE is an appropriate or suitable venue for their training. In some cases I would agree with them that the TAFE sector has not been able to meet its requirements or its obligations, but in many other ways the TAFE sector is producing some excellent courses and some excellent programs and should be supported. We need to be educating the community about the importance of technical and vocational education and the fact that it is a viable alternative to university study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Committee also recommended the development and refinement by industry of national competency standards across all occupations to meet industry standards and needs and to make sure that they are national standards that are applicable across the whole nation. That is one of the fundamental issues that need to be addressed in the next two to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned the fact that unfortunately in our community we have too many students who believe that university is the only place for them to go. A survey of youth and community attitudes indicates that there has been a massive decline in young people's interest in TAFE&mdash;from 20 per cent of 15- to 17-year-olds in 1984 to only 13 per cent in 1990, which is an unrealistically low level. The Finn report says that 50 per cent of young people between 15 and 19 should be going to TAFE and that places should be found for them in TAFE. Unfortunately, most of them do not wish to go to TAFE because they do not believe that TAFE is appropriate. That is a problem we have to address very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement released in February, the Commonwealth set out to make an offer to the States to substantially address the growth needs in the TAFE and vocational education and training sectors. It made an offer to the States to assume full financial responsibility for vocational education and training across Australia and to develop a new system of institutes of vocational education, building on the existing TAFE sector. It is a very generous offer, and it is being negotiated with the States at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It commits the Commonwealth to establishing an assured and stable basis of triennial funding. It promises a total of $720m over the next three years on top of existing financial allocations. Brian Finn in his report indicated that the vocational education and training sector will need growth of the order of $1 billion a year for the next 10 years to accommodate the training needs of this country. The substantial offer of funding that has been made in the One Nation statement very much addresses those targets that Brian Finn set. I would encourage all State governments to accept the offers that the Commonwealth is making, because it is in that area that our real needs have to be addressed over the next few years. There is no need for any substantial new growth in university places. The need for growth is in the technical and vocational education and training sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like briefly to talk about the schools funding area, because that is an issue that has been of concern to constituents in my electorate. A few points need to be made in response to some of the comments of the honourable member for Braddon. He indicated that he felt that this Government had in some way restricted choice for parents. Nothing could be further from the truth. There has been a massive injection of money from the Commonwealth Government into the non-government sector over the last eight years. In fact, this Government spends $1.3 billion a year supporting 850,000 students in 2,468 non-government schools. Of those schools, 250 are new schools which have been funded since Labor came to office. How anyone could suggest that this Government has not met the commitment that it is required to meet for the funding of non-government schools, and that in some way we have restricted parental choice, is beyond me, and the figures prove that that is not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago this Government announced increased funding for all non-government schools through to the year 2000. That is budgeted at over $100m, and is fully costed and accounted for. There has been real growth each year over and above the rate of inflation in the amount of grants that this Government has given to the non-government sector. There have been no cutbacks; there has been real growth. We are providing full parental choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon made some comments about the new schools policy, and suggested that supporting the Opposition's Fightback policy&mdash;which abolishes the new schools system that this Government has in place&mdash;would somehow improve parental choice. The honourable member for Braddon should realise that in fact there are large sections of the non-government school community which do not support the Fightback proposition. They understand and realise that by having an open door policy, which is what the Opposition is suggesting&mdash;that we abolish the new schools committee structure that reviews each application for funding and determines whether a new non-government school in a certain area will be viable&mdash;we will have quite a reckless waste of government resources because unlimited numbers of new schools will open up in competition with existing non-government schools and existing government schools. This will lead to massive duplication of resources and waste of government money. It will create enormous problems for existing non-government schools as well as existing government schools. I would not have thought that the Opposition would support such a massive waste of government resources, leading to such an enormous amount of duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the existing policy of this Government in carefully scrutinising all applications for funding for new non-government schools is worthy of support. We will find that most people in the non-government sector throughout the community do not support the Opposition's policy on the abolition of the new schools process. I realise I have gone a little over the time I was allotted, so I just commend the three Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that over the past decade Australians have finally come to grips with the concept that education is valuable. But this understanding by Australians, and their warm embrace of education at all levels, has caused us a few problems. Last week, on 23 May, Geoff Maslen, education writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age,</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cruel reality facing thousands of Victorians qualified for university is that their chances of admission are getting worse each  year. . . This year, the number of students who failed to win a place in the State's higher-education institutions was more than double that of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures compiled by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee show that up to 19,000 hopeful students were turned away from higher education in Victoria, 38 per cent of the national total and a 110 per cent increase in unmet demand from 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those denied a place applied to a TAFE college but the TAFE system has been forced to turn away even more students than the universities.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that up to 50,000 qualified students have missed  places in university this year. Perhaps as many as 100,000 potential students have been denied places in TAFE. I am delighted that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is at the table tonight, because I want to talk about the very special needs of a very special area in Victoria for higher education and higher education funding. My electorate of La Trobe encompasses Mount Dandenong and the ranges and has special needs to the north in the outer east and very special needs to the south in the south-east. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For almost two years I have been involved with a council of people from industry, politics, education and the general community lobbying government for facilities at a tertiary level in the outer east to the top of the mountain. We have been successful and we will now have new university facilities. I address the rest of my remarks to the south-eastern growth corridor of Victoria, which has one of the lowest participation rates in Australia and is the lowest major area in Victoria. The Mornington education district, which includes Berwick, Pakenham, Cranbourne and Dandenong, has the lowest participation rates in tertiary education in Melbourne and the surrounding area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission, in a report on patterns of participation in higher education in Victoria, found very wide variations in the 17- to 24-year-old age group of 30 per cent participation in Camberwell and Brighton and 4 per cent in Cranbourne. In the figures for 17- to 24-year-olds attending university we have such anomalies as 32.7 per cent for Camberwell, 24.7 per cent for Doncaster-Templestowe, 28 per cent for Hawthorn and 28 per cent for Kew. In the south-eastern growth area, the figures are: Berwick, 5.7 per cent; Cranbourne, 4.2 per cent; Dandenong, 8.9 per cent; and Pakenham, 9.5 per cent. It is discouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projected growth rate in the south-eastern growth corridor is almost twice that for any other designated education area in Victoria. The VIPSEC report dated April 1991 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in a limited number of cases where participation is low and substantial long term growth is expected additional higher education campuses could be established. An obvious example of this kind of development is at Berwick which is central to a major growth corridor, some distance from existing campuses, and where a major co-operative TAFE/Higher Education development could occur. In this case the likely growth is such that adequate provision would need to be made for major developments in both sectors in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems obvious, to me at least, that our system is out of balance and that we need to address this crying need of our students. We have made representations to the Minister; we have made representations to his Department; we have made representations to the Victorian Minister for higher education; and we have made representations to his Department. As a result of this VIPSEC report, it became obvious that we desperately needed facilities located in Berwick next to the TAFE campus. Therefore, we formed a planning council in the south-eastern growth area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leading on from that council, a working party was established, made up of representatives from the Federal Government, DEET, the Victorian Government, VIPSEC, the player university&mdash;that is, the university responsible for that area, Monash&mdash;and from Dandenong TAFE, being the TAFE component already establishing a major campus at Berwick. Over the past nine months, that council and that working party have worked to try to define the necessary element for growth and the need for a new campus. We have made representations to the Minister. The working party, unfortunately, has not yet been able to bring down a formal report, because all of this initiative began with a need in the growth area. The growth area starts in Dandenong and runs down past Pakenham towards the valley. It includes Cranbourne and Pakenham but is centred on Berwick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash facilities, the majority of which are at Clayton, with some at Caulfield next door, run to Frankston and then to Churchill. Berwick presents itself as a centre of the demographics for the area that Monash would serve for students. Some 150 acres is available at Berwick on a railhead&mdash;that is, a rail station on an established rail line&mdash;and on a major national arterial road with on-off ramps nearing completion. On that 150 acres we can combine tertiary education at university level with tertiary education at TAFE level and create these pathways and links between training and university education that we talk about today as being so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were well down the track towards having DEET, the Minister and the State Minister agree to the capital funding for 1994 to establish the campus that Monash has requested. Unfortunately, all of a sudden the issue became political. The honourable member for Holt, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), decided that for State political purposes it would be wise for him to support such a campus of Monash in the city of Dandenong, which is very close to the existing campus of Monash at Clayton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a political issue in which we have a major politician, the Attorney-General, trying to win a campus location for a university in what we believe to be a less advantageous location for our students. Make no mistake, our students are crying out for university places, and there is a 5 per cent participation rate in the 17- to 24-year age group. It is a crying shame. They want to go, but the transport problem is so difficult from Mount Dandenong and regions surrounding it. It takes so long to get to any major campus by train or bus. The train lines do not run to Monash, because in the past we built universities where it was convenient, not where it was intelligent. We did not think about the needs of the community 20 or 30 years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, Berwick is in the centre of the highest growth region in Victoria. The number of students will double in only a few years. I believe the growth rate today has surpassed that of the Gold Coast. It is an area that is crying out for tertiary places. We have available in one place land in an abundant quantity to fulfil the needs of a grassroots tertiary facility, next door to a new major TAFE campus which will support ultimately some 4,000 or 5,000 equivalent full time places. It has a railway station that is established and it is on major bus routes, with a bus depot at the front door of the proposed university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site has major car access to a national arterial road which dumps off at the location of the proposed site. The people from that area request both the State and Federal Ministers to quickly ask their working party to complete its report and its recommendation for a Berwick campus of Monash University, and to fund that campus through the 1994 capital funding which the Government is now intending to roll into recurrent funding. It is my most sincere request of this Minister that he act to the best benefit of all the students in all the areas and that he act quickly so that we can have the additional places that we so desperately need in an area that is crying out for access. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) earlier tonight, we got the same turgid diatribe that we tend to get about education issues from the shadow Minister for education&mdash;a failure to reflect upon the real success, the real commitment that has been shown to education at all levels, the real commitment that has been shown by the Government during its time in office to the training and skilling of our young people to enable them to enter the work force, and a complete failure to acknowledge the real achievements that have occurred across these sectors, particularly&mdash;if I can just apply a regional focus to my remarks for a short time&mdash;in the area of western Sydney where, historically, the participation rates, the access to and equity in higher education were at lamentable levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that one of the great achievements that we can point to with the University of Western Sydney is the opening up of opportunities to young people from that region to higher education. They suffered from many of the difficulties relating to transportation, the lack of role models for children there because of the limited number of people who had completed secondary education let alone done any further training, and the limited opportunities that existed. When we came to office only one in three children completed secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were significant disincentives in the system that prevented young people from being able to complete secondary school. That whole culture has been changed largely because our Government has recognised those particular priorities. It has recognised that, in order to be advantaged, our young people need to get equity in their educational opportunity. That has been a foundation stone upon which our education policies have been built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth contrasting that with the voucher concept that the Opposition is proposing in areas such as education. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at areas such as western Sydney that I represent, we will find that a voucher system or some form of loan arrangement would be very much to the detriment of the people there because they are the ones who would not get access to higher education. We would go back to the bad old days when those people did not have the opportunity. Conservative governments in the past perceived that those people did not even have the right to aspire to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of Bills such as those we have before us tonight is part of ensuring that those young people do have that opportunity. In the high cost courses, the sciences, engineering and so forth, a voucher system would be the very last thing we would want to encourage or promote if we were really trying to encourage opportunity, excellence and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I believe the people of Australia would be well placed to read carefully the implications of Fightback for the education sector. Once they do that, I have no doubt that the vast majority of Australians will conclude, as any fair-minded person would, that a voucher system approach would fundamentally cut at the bone of what equity in education is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available to me tonight, I particularly want to refer to the area of TAFE training. If there is one sector that really has a need, that is crying out for attention and for which this Government has faced up to providing an effective regime, it is the TAFE sector. For far too long we have allowed TAFE to be left to the performance, or lack of performance, of State governments. Not enough scrutiny has been paid to the results that should be sought from the TAFE system, not enough regard has been paid to the need to develop an effective training regime and not enough regard has been paid to the need for the TAFE system to be integrated with other areas of our education system. For far too long TAFE has been the poor relation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) we set about changing that; we set about changing the culture of TAFE; we set about building on the report of the inquiry by the Education Council Review Committee into young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training, known as the Finn report, building on the Deveson report and also recognising the most recent efforts of the Employment and Skills Formation Council, the Carmichael committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is particularly important because the whole area of TAFE depends on that greater vocational focus. It depends on having the resources at a national level to give TAFE the credibility it deserves, and it depends on developing the pathways that are so critical in the linkage between TAFE, the school system and the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way of achieving that, as was outlined in the One Nation statement, is to make an historic commitment at the Commonwealth level towards the adequate funding of our TAFE sector. That commitment does a number of things. It provides an extra $310m per year by 1995 above the Commonwealth-State provision for TAFE in 1991. This represents an additional injection of $720m over the 1993-95 triennium. It paves the way for a new higher status, better resourced system for vocational education and training. The Commonwealth is offering to take over full responsibility for vocational education and training, including the transformation of TAFE into a new and expanded system of institutes of vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A process of reform to entry level training arrangements will involve the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, the industrial parties and training providers. We are seeking the involvement of the States, industry and training providers to address the emerging needs of industry for advanced training for higher level technicians. Part of that process is to open many more apprenticeships and training places within the system. It includes $18.3m for an additional 9,000 first year apprentice places in 1992, raising employment incentives from 3,000 to 5,000; $10.1m for an additional 10,000 places for the Australian apprenticeship system in 1992; $5m to retain second year apprentices at risk of retrenchment, and so on. There is a whole host of measures all designed to target the labour market area effectively and to ensure the TAFE system is able to meet the demands and challenges it faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the proposals of the Federal Government in relation to TAFE, it is disappointing to see the failure of the States to this point to respond adequately to the visionary approach that we have sought to adopt in the TAFE sector. Clearly, the States are more driven, as is so often the case, by their own individual rights and responsibilities, rather than the longer term needs of young people and the opportunities that an effectively resourced TAFE system provides for many young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Developing a flexible and diverse range of opportunities for young people, relying solely on students getting places at universities and expecting all students to complete the full period of secondary school and then look for places in universities is a flawed strategy in educational terms. There needs to be a variety of options. All of us who have had experience in education&mdash;no matter what sector that experience has been in&mdash;would recognise that the training opportunities need to be across that broader range. In my fairly recent experience, as one who was teaching in an academic institution, I can relate to the needs that exist in higher level education and the TAFE sector that necessitate being addressed in a comprehensive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way we do that is to try to get those linkages within the system to be more flexible, to provide more opportunities. Some of the artificial barriers that were there in the past with the old binary system of higher education need to give way to a more contemporary approach. That is something that has been the hallmark of our reforms in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I believe TAFE is the key ingredient in that approach. It is clear that we need to be able to realise the objectives set by the Finn report in relation to TAFE training. We need to be able to ensure that we achieve far more than the very mixed results that the States have achieved in relation to TAFE in recent times. The One Nation economic statement and the measures outlined tonight go a long way towards providing the sorts of TAFE opportunities that are needed: the new vocational courses, the flexibility to move to where there is a real demand for new courses. In my own area there is a shortage of places in areas such as the hospitality industry, in growing industries and in growing employment opportunities. Part of resourcing the TAFE system in this way is to provide opportunities for young people seeking to move into those fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go to the broader issue of higher education and, despite the demands, we look at just how much has been achieved by this Government in higher education, we see the massive increase that has occurred in the number of places provided in higher education&mdash;an increase from 348,683 to 534,500 places in universities and the college equivalents through that time&mdash;and the amount of expenditure that has been committed to the higher education sector over that time. That has amounted to $1.2 billion, a 41 per cent real increase in funding for higher education&mdash;and more is planned in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent economic statement and the further plans in higher education demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment in this area and the ongoing commitment in relation to Austudy, to ensure that there is equity, to ensure there is opportunity for participation in education. All of those things have been part of that chapter of achievement I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast is stark compared with what the Opposition would do in terms of that access and that equity. For those reasons, it gives me pleasure to support these Bills. The Government has an excellent record in the provision of educational funding to the school sector and the higher education sector. Through the measures that have been initiated in recent times, we are committed to ensuring that that commitment is very real in the TAFE sector. There should not be a person in this Parliament who is not just as committed as the Ministers have been to ensuring that our TAFE system gets the sorts of resources that it deserves and that the students who are aspiring to train there deserve as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite illogical for the honourable member for Parramatta to be critical of the Opposition's policy. One of the things that I find most exciting about the Fightback program is the extraordinary commitment that it gives to education and the development of education in this country. We are a young country which depends very much on its skills for its ability to maintain its trading position and, with that, its standard of living. We have a highly literate population and, compared with many other countries in the world, we have always had a very high level of skills and training amongst our work force. It is that which has given us our trading position, not only in the technological area but also in the primary industries area. Therefore, education is central to the future of this country. It is quite illogical for the honourable member for Parramatta to be critical of the Fightback program in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback promises that the Liberal and National parties will commit themselves to Commonwealth expenditure of more than $3 billion on new education and training programs over this decade. Without a doubt, in the nearly 10 years that the Labor Party has been in power in Australia there has been an alarming run down in the priority accorded to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up a number of specifics which Government members have raised this evening in the context of trying to put forward the suggestion that the Government's programs are unsatisfactory, under-funded and undirected. I turn, first of all, to one of the early speeches by a Government member, namely, the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Crawford). She is about to inherit, through a redistribution of boundaries, a significant part of my present electorate of Moncrieff, namely, the northern end, which is the urban sprawl area of Beenleigh and Eagleby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forde and I were both educated in Queensland and she must have traded on no Queensland-educated Opposition members listening to her speech, judging from the extraordinary things she said. She pointed out that people above the age of 42 who had been educated in Queensland had no high school education, or a very low level of education. She blamed that on the National-Liberal Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little bit of quick arithmetic&mdash;and I did teach mathematics&mdash;shows that those who were aged 42 in 1991 were born in 1949. They did what was called the old scholarship examination in 1962. They are part of the baby boom generation. I was just a little earlier than that&mdash;not very many years earlier&mdash;and I did scholarship in 1955. I went to an independent high school simply because the government schools in Queensland were slums when I went to high school. One got a desk, a chair and 49 compatriots in one's class at high school and that was it. Of course, that was in the days of a State Labor government. It is absolute nonsense to be blaming that sort of past tense in Queensland on a National-Liberal Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first three years in government&mdash;from 1957 to 1960&mdash;that National-Liberal Government built more than 60 schools. By the end of its next three years in government&mdash;by the end of 1963&mdash;it had built nearly 100 new schools. We had a Labor government that knew that a baby boom was coming and we already had atrocious conditions in our schools&mdash;particularly our high schools. There were three government high schools in a city of half a million people. The independent high school I went to was not a palace; compared with today's standards in any school, it was a slum. There was no government support. It was an enormous sacrifice on my parents' part for me to go to that school. But they wanted me to have an education, which I was not going to get in a government school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not putting down the government school sector today, but it is telling honourable members what it was like under a Labor government. I do not want to hear the honourable member for Forde in here again making any reflections on the Liberal and National parties in Queensland in educational terms. It was the Liberal-National Government that lifted the school leaving age to 15 years. It was still 13 in the late 1950s in Queensland&mdash;the only State in Australia in that position, thanks to many years of an atrophied State Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the signs of an atrophied Commonwealth Labor Government now, particularly in the education area. It is quite clear that our educational system is not coping with the new demands of technology and the new demands of education generally. It clearly cannot cope with growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from the growth State in Australia. I recognise what the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who spoke before me, said about growth in his area. He said that he thought it was actually higher than the Gold Coast. If we take just the Gold Coast&mdash;just that little coastal strip&mdash;yes, it possibly is; but when we take the region a couple of miles away from the coastal strip, we find the fastest growth rate in Australia. Of course, we also have the most under-funded education. That is against the fact that the census shows that we have, overwhelmingly, two age groups in that part of the world&mdash;one is the retired people, who do not have major educational demands; the other very concentrated age group, whose number is well above the national average, is made up of young families. The demand for education in that part of the world is huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the honourable member for Forde, who is about to inherit the northern part of my electorate&mdash;a huge growth area and a low income area: the Beenleigh-Eagleby area. The honourable member will probably get a very rude awakening when she inherits Canterbury College, for example&mdash;one of the new independent schools in that part of the world. Under the extraordinary structure that the Labor Party put on the independent schools program back in the days when Senator Susan Ryan was Minister, it decided to entrench a disadvantage for any independent school. The rationale was that the Government did not want independent schools taking funds away from government schools. That rationale did not take account of the high growth areas where there were virtually no independent schools and where the demand was bound to come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate overall&mdash;going down to the Gold Coast and out into the hinterland&mdash;in my time as a member of parliament a very high number of independent schools have opened. The extraordinary thing about that area is that there were so few independent schools prior to the mid-1980s. But they have come with the huge growth in the number of young people in the population. Some very exciting things are happening there. But every one of those schools suffers from an historical disadvantage. They are not, as the honourable member for Forde said, `rich' private schools; they are average independent schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents choose to send their children to these independent schools for all sorts of reasons&mdash;notably, all of them are Christian schools, and I think that is a major motivation behind parents sending their children there&mdash;and they have the right to the same level of funding as an inner-Brisbane school. These parents are no more advantaged and their children are not necessarily any more advantaged; but the schools are disadvantaged, though not classified as such, which then disadvantages the parents and the children. It makes their fees higher because they cannot qualify for the same level of funding given to schools classified as disadvantaged. Therefore, the fees have to be higher and that counts out a whole lot of children from lower income families. The Labor Party's policies on independent schools in 1983 and 1984 were, frankly, based on prejudice and a wish to stop the growth of independent schools. There is only one reason why the independent school sector has grown as much as it has: it offers something that a number of people want. That is in no way a put-down of the government school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of excellent government schools doing very exciting educational things in my electorate; I do not put them down. In fact, government schools can have an enormous natural advantage. Because they tend to be large, if they are in a growth area, they can offer very particular programs that smaller schools&mdash;notably, independent schools, which tend to be smaller&mdash;cannot do. There is a place for both. But the matter of choice is, of course, fundamental. The essence of the matter, and the reason the Labor Party is so far off track, is that it cares about the system, not the students. It is really all about education. Schools are all about educating young people. Post-secondary education is about educating youngish people and some older people. But we must get away from the sorts of prejudices that exist at the moment or we will continue to have the skewed and unsatisfactory situation that we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these growth areas of Australia, the Government's programs in relation to schools certainly cannot cope, and this applies also in the tertiary area. Again I come back to my part of the world, not only because I want to talk about my part of the world, which I usually do, but because it illustrates a future, and if we stay in the straitjacket we are in at the moment we will just get more and more distortions in the system. We have a new university on the Gold Coast which was established only a few years ago. The extraordinary thing about the announcement of the Government's decision to fund the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education&mdash;and heaven knows we had been pounding on the doors for a while on that&mdash;was that there was not any sign of getting that college until Bond University was announced. I remember people who had been fighting to get the college for some time going into despair when Bond University was announced. They said, `That is the end of it. Now we are going to have Bond University we will never get our college'. I said, `Hang on. I think the best thing you have going for you, if you want to get a college of advanced education, is Bond University'. I was right. The Government had to set up a government institution because there was going to be a private institution there to show the Government up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That institution has done extraordinarily good work, particularly in hospitality tertiary education&mdash;contrary to what the honourable member for Parramatta was saying. It has always taken more students than it has been funded for. It is cramped for space. It has worked so hard because it has an enormous motivation towards the needs of local education. But the overall straitjacket of funding of tertiary education under this Labor Government has severely limited it. Like many other tertiary institutions, last year it took a lot more students than it was funded for because the pressures were so enormous. It meant that this year it could take very few more because it was already grossly overcrowded. But, even though the demand had been established and the abilities of the students were established last year, still there was no give in the system this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parramatta talks about what his Government does. His Government does a number of things&mdash;he can put figures on it&mdash;but I notice he does not mention, or discount at all in the figures he quotes, the amount of money that has been collected, for example, through HECS, which has to be considered whenever one looks at increases in funding. If we do not say that a certain amount of this was taken out of new</PARA>
<PARA>revenue collections for this reason, we are not telling the whole story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to express a concern about structures. If ever there is a sign of a government getting hardening of the arteries it is when it concentrates on structures and tags in the education area versus outcome. I feel quite ambivalent about the old binary system. I worked in university administration. I lectured at the Queensland Institute of Technology, which was a college of advanced education. I have lectured in adult education. I have seen the whole thing, and I have had a close association with it in my time in Parliament. There were some rigidities in the binary system, but for the honourable member for Parramatta to say that, by doing away with the binary system and putting all the education systems into one, we have done away with rigidities is nonsense. The rigidities did not lie in the terminology of universities or colleges of advanced education but in the attitude one had to the other or which one thought the other had to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that persistently occupied the attention of people in colleges of advanced education, it was what they thought university people thought of them. Prestige and so on is always an issue. There is some essence of truth in that if it goes through into the policy-making process&mdash;if that thinking permeates attitudes. I do not think, by and large, it did. It did lead to some rigidities. For example, the Queensland Institute of Technology had some excellent courses and it was restricted to some extent in how far it could pursue very exciting and worthwhile research programs. That needed improvement. I am not convinced that just by renaming a sector one has eased it up or added anything to it. It really would not worry me if colleges of advanced education were called universities if I were satisfied first that the function that colleges were set up to meet was being met and, secondly, if I were not very afraid, as I am, that TAFE is going to move to fill a vacuum. Already technical and further education colleges are starting to call themselves colleges of technology or institutes of technology, and it is the next step. I just see a vacuum left by not having addressed what CAEs were first set up for in that renaming process, which was very much a vocational tertiary education. The vacuum is there&mdash;although it is not as big as it was prior to the CAEs&mdash;and without a doubt TAFE is going to move to fill it. Already it is very clear that there are people in the TAFE sector who have the same chip on their shoulder now&mdash;they have inherited it from the CAEs&mdash;and will try to move up and be pseudo CAEs by calling themselves something else. I would not care about any of that ego stuff if it were not for the students; that is what bothers me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAFE was set up for post-secondary students who did not want to go into a tertiary&mdash;as in university or college&mdash;area. It has developed&mdash;not as fast as it should have; it has been the cinderella&mdash;and done some very exciting things. There are some very good people in the TAFE sector who are very highly motivated. But they have been dealing essentially with students who either were in transition situations to tertiary or did not want academic training but wanted post-secondary training&mdash;and good training. I am very concerned that, in this labelling or whatever it is, and the massaging of the ego&mdash;as we do here in Parliament&mdash;of the education establishment, once again we are going to forget about the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my 25 years as a professional in education, including my 18 years in parliament, over and over again I have seen that in all the debates about education, essentially carried out by educators, the educatees are not part of them. We must always in this Parliament remember that the education system is about educating people, and those people are the ones we have to concentrate on. I do not think the Government has got it right. I think we need great imagination. We need to accept the very exciting initiatives that are coming from the independent sector. I had hoped tonight to talk about a couple of very exciting things that are happening in the independent sector in my part of the world, but my time is running out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say just quickly that at Jimboomba there is a quite new secondary development&mdash;it will, of course, be in Rankin after the next redistribution&mdash;called the South Queensland College, which is part Japanese students, part Australian students and totally Japanese funded. It has huge establishment costs and provides an immersion course in Japanese for the Australian students and an immersion course in English for the Japanese students. The honourable member for Parramatta talks about exciting things, but it has developed a golf management course which will go to what it calls grade 13. It is going to be taking students from the hospitality sector at the Gold Coast University College and training them there on the scene. I think that is very exciting. Some people will snigger about it, but with the number of golf courses we have in our part of the world, which are attracting millions of dollars in tourism, and the number of jobs golf is providing, it is very important indeed. It has been left to a private institution to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never take away from the importance of the dual sectors and how they stimulate one another to innovation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that the Opposition register its great concern at the way in which the Government has handled the management of its training policy. The second reading amendment drew the attention of the House to the fact that, after nine years of Labor, the Government has demonstrated a continuing inability to establish a practicable policy for raising the skills of Australia's young people. For the first six or seven years of the Government there was virtually a total neglect of TAFE. Throughout the period of this Government, while participation increased in schools and in universities, participation in TAFE courses remained virtually static.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it was brought home to the Government that Australia was lagging very badly behind other countries in the skills of its young people and that this lack of skills was a significant factor in making it difficult for young people to find employment in jobs that could be sustained against international competition. So the Government, in a flurry of activity, called upon several inquiries to provide it with reports. There was the Deveson inquiry and the Finn inquiry, and earlier this year the report commissioned by the Employment and Skills Formation Council, the Carmichael report, was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no lack of information available to the Government about the disastrous situation that Australia finds itself in. The Deveson committee informed the Government and the community that so far as skills development was concerned Australia was at the back of the pack internationally. The Finn committee reviewed the whole area of post-compulsory education and training and drew the Government's attention once again to the fact that Australia is well behind in comparison with other industrialised countries. Indeed, it concluded that in the schools area there is incontrovertible evidence that very large numbers of young people are coming out of the schooling system with inadequate basic skills of literacy and numeracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has received a plethora of advice. Much of this advice has drawn the Government's attention to the need for much more effective monitoring of the skills which young people have which are relevant to their employment in the work force. Indeed, this need was a key element in the report of the Finn committee. Yet it is very striking when one looks at the statements of the Government in this area, whether they be in relation to secondary schooling, post-compulsory years of secondary schooling or to TAFE training, that the Government is remarkably hesitant to commit itself to the need for effective monitoring of skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the reason for this is the Government's dependence through the accord process on support of the union movement. It finds in the education area that there has been a continual resistance by its union mates to provide the community with effective and accurate information about the level of skills being achieved either in the schooling or post-schooling systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the need for effective monitoring was a major theme in the Finn report, little has been said about it by the Government. The Meyer committee is meeting and investigating this area and it also is finding that there is enormous resistance to developing effective systems for making sure that young Australians have skills at international level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has done in each of these areas has been to return to those kinds of decisions that it finds much easier to take, which are in accord with the ideology of particularly the Left faction of the Government which delights in central bureaucratic controls, which loves to see Canberra dominating the education and training institutions in this country and which sees in increased central supervision an opportunity for the Government to pursue the agendas and the shibboleths of the Left. In this area of higher education we see, tragically, a Minister drawn from that faction pursuing these policies in a very rigid and ideological way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to TAFE, what we see is the Government putting forward some proposals committing funds conditional on the States agreeing to accept Canberra's dictate. This was the Dawkins agenda for schooling which led to the collapse of trust between the States and the Commonwealth in relation to primary and secondary education. This same agenda today has been taken up in relation to TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government makes much of the fact that it was prepared to commit in One Nation an additional $420m to TAFE investment&mdash;$420m that, of course, like every other promise in that One Nation policy, was completely unfunded. It is money to be drawn out of the air, as it were, to be devoted to additional development of training opportunities. But the sad thing was that that money was made entirely conditional on the States agreeing to hand over control of their TAFE systems to Canberra. They have not agreed to do so. There have been several discussions, there has been a meeting of the Premiers, and there is still no agreement. Maybe there will be an agreement at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know one government&mdash;the Kirner Government in Victoria&mdash;is desperate for some of that money, because it says that its re-election chances may be affected by its ability to put additional money into the TAFE training area. The other States, however, are much wiser and their financial situation is not quite as desperate as Victoria's, and even the Labor States have expressed their grave reservations over the meaning of this promise of money by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, instead of a government which is able to tell the Australian people what it is going to do in the TAFE training area, what we find and what this second reading amendment draws attention to is the continuing inability of the Government to actually establish a policy in this area. No-one knows what the Government's policy for TAFE is. No-one knows the terms on which this $420m will be made available, or indeed if it will be made available at all if the States do not agree to the Commonwealth's terms as spelt out in One Nation. So after nine years of Labor, with Australia still at the back of the pack, with Australia still with one of the least skilled work forces in the Western world, we find the Government pursuing an approach which is causing dissension and division within the ranks of the Labor Party between the Federal Government and the States, and which has still not eventuated in a practicable agreement as to how TAFE expansion is to be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a dramatic contrast this is to the fully funded and developed strategy for TAFE and training which is spelt out in the coalition's Fightback program. In that program there is a commitment of funds to TAFE which is not conditional on the States agreeing to surrender their authority, which is not conditional on centralising control over TAFE, but which, on the contrary, recognises that if we are going to build up training institutions which have the flexibility to meet the needs of their local communities, which are going to be able to attract additional resources from the private as well as the public sectors to provide additional places in TAFE for Australia's young people, it is necessary to provide those institutions with a much greater independence and autonomy. That is what TAFEs want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAFEs around Australia are giving the Government a very clear message that they are highly suspicious of the package now being promoted by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). They have no expectation that the situation which will emerge from these discussions will be favourable to their development as institutions and, consequently, they have the gravest concerns over the future of training in this country. It is for these reasons that the coalition moved its second reading amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>As I mentioned in my speech on the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, there is probably no area of education and training, no level, in which the Government's failure is more evident to the community than in the higher education area. As a result of the White Paper of 1988 there has been an upheaval in the higher education system. The vocationally oriented colleges of advanced education have been forcibly merged with the pre-1987 universities, to the enormous detriment, in many cases, of the provision of satisfactory and targeted vocational education in many regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition do not say that there are no grounds and never were any grounds for any mergers at all; what we do say is that whatever amalgamations took place between institutions should have been voluntary and there should have been recognition of the need for a diversity of institutions in this area. We have not had that. We have had instead an ideological assault on so-called elitist universities and, as a consequence, the destruction of opportunities for vocational education and training provided by the colleges of advanced education, to the enormous detriment of many of Australia's young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a system which has not got the flexibility to provide additional places to Australian students above those funded by the Government. As a consequence, although there is a universal concession that there is in this country from the point of view of long term employment for our young people a need that they have skills of international standard, the Government deliberately, flouting the advice of its expert advisory body, the Industry Commission, has persisted with a system of regulation which denies to the universities the flexibility to provide places to Australian students in the way that they have to provide additional places to students from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a quite intolerable inequity; we have a quite intolerable rigidity; and we have the inevitable consequence of this kind of central planning, planning which has worked nowhere in the world&mdash;institutions which are unable to adjust to the demands made upon them and institutions which are unable to open their doors to many qualified Australian students. Again, this is a dramatic contrast to the coalition's policy, which will provide opportunities to the universities of this country to open the doors to these 50,000 Australian students and opportunities to those students to achieve tertiary places which are currently open only to students from other countries. It is with those arguments in our minds that we have moved this second reading amendment. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is now considering seven pieces of legislation relating to the coal industry. The first part of the package comprises the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Funding Bill; the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Bill; the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Bill; and the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Amendment Bill. These Bills relate to the area of my colleague the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He will be speaking in the debate with regard to those four Bills and moving a second reading amendment, which might have to be executed by me as part of the guillotine procedure. That amendment will contain words to the effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst welcoming the provisions of the Bill which return the responsibility for the administration of the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund to the coal industry, the House is of the opinion that the long service leave provisions should not be limited to those employees to whom an award, determination, order or agreement applies".</PARA>
<PARA>The second part of the package comprises the other three Bills: the Coal Industry Amendment Bill; the Coal Research Assistance Amendment Bill and the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. The first of those, the Coal Industry Amendment Bill, relates to a refining of the powers and a reduction, in effect, of the powers of the Joint Coal Board, which is the board which exists under legislation between the Federal Parliament and the New South Wales Parliament. I serve notice that I will seek to move to that a second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)notes that this legislation is complementary to legislation of the New South Wales Parliament; and</PARA>

<PARA>The second Bill, the Coal Research Assistance Amendment Bill, restructures the research arrangements and effectively privatises the research arrangements of the coal industry in a most satisfactory way. The final Bill, the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill, abolishes the coal export duty levy. Under the terms of the guillotine, I have to serve notice on the House that I would propose to move to the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)notes that the Government has adopted in the Bill one of the seven key tax abolition planks of `Fightback'; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)calls on the Government to implement the other six key tax abolition planks of `Fightback', among them being the abolition of payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I have placed before the House the nature of the debate. I think it is a great pity that seven large pieces of legislation on the coal industry, arguably one of Australia's most important export industries in terms of revenue&mdash;at this time, the most important&mdash;have all now been lumped together and are to be pushed through the Parliament in the next one hour and fifty minutes through to 12.20 a.m. tomorrow. At the sad end of the autumn session, the twilight moments of the autumn session, in this mad rush to comply with Senate requirements, we have one of the major packages of legislation on the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of that aspect, the coalition is not opposed to the three Bills to which I am specifically referring. They constitute, in general terms, a correct step forward by the Government; in some parts, they constitute a stealing of coalition policy. But equally they represent the outcome of a number of deliberations over recent years. I commend many aspects of the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically on the Coal Industry Amendment Bill, we have this situation which, I must say, is curious in the extreme. The Australian Parliament has decided to link up with just one other State for the purposes of formulating the Joint Coal Board. This happened just after World War II at a time when there was a very small coal industry in other States and a slightly larger coal industry in New South Wales. Each year we have an annual report of the Joint Coal Board, which is made available to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of New South Wales, when other States that have now developed major coal industries are not parties to, in a direct sense, the Joint Coal Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a completely separate Queensland Coal Board, which produces&mdash;it is a bit of a worry&mdash;an even larger and more glossy report than the Joint Coal Board. It is this free-standing State level board which carries out considerable work on research. It probably does not, on that score, replicate what happens with the Joint Coal Board, but equally it is, in a sense, a convoluted structure associated with one of Australia's most important exporting industries&mdash;an industry performing against considerable difficulty in a very competitive international trading place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that at some stage the Government&mdash;if this Government does not, the next one will&mdash;must go back to negotiate with the New South Wales Parliament and the New South Wales Government. We accept that we do not have the right to take unilateral action. It would have to be something done in liaison. Those negotiations would be undertaken with a view to winding up the Joint Coal Board and restructuring its arrangements where best they might go, particularly the occupational health dimensions, which are extremely important and not to be underestimated. Yet if they are all that important, why is it that we have a Joint Coal Board operating only in respect of New South Wales and federally, and not, in a sense, picking up on the very large coal industry, open-cut and underground, in Queensland, Victoria, to a lesser extent South Australia at Leigh Creek, Western Australia and even dear old Tasmania, where there is a boutique coal industry, although Tasmanians probably would not care for my describing it in those terms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that the time has come, in the middle of this recession that we did not have to have, to think long and hard about this industry structure. Whilst I know that some of the colleagues of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the Minister himself will jealously defend the fiefdom and the performance of the Joint Coal Board and say that this is another untouchable which has been there since 1946 and should be allowed to plough on into the future, I also accept that the Minister accepts the challenge that change is upon us in many policy areas. I would hope he would agree with the tenet that there is not an automatic blank cheque for joint organisational boards and quangos, that they are, from time to time, the subject of proper review to see whether their functions relate to the requirements of industry and government and the impact of change which has arisen since the last review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I am certain there is a case now to completely restructure and revamp the Joint Coal Board. The industry is of that mind in general terms, although it is very careful how, when, where and how loudly it states that particular objective&mdash;and I understand the reasons for that. I do not want to dwell on this issue because of the time factor. I simply put before the House the forty-fourth annual report of the Joint Coal Board and the annual report of the Queensland Coal Board and say that there goes Australia again with non-meshing arrangements associated with such an important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second dimension I wish to put before the House relates to the export potential of the coal industry. Undeniably, Japan is an extremely important customer for Australian coal. Korean, Taiwanese, north-east Asian, European and other markets are opening up. In January I visited Korea and Japan. I looked at the coal market and at other energy aspects such as transport, primary industry export prospects and the political and economic circumstances of those two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, some factors are moving in favour of Australian agriculture and, to a lesser extent, Australian coal, although there are some fierce competitors on the horizon. Three factors are involved. These include, firstly, the fact that the environmental circumstances in South Korea and Japan are becoming more and more critical with regard to the quality of coal and the quality of food products being sent there; secondly, the greater urbanisation that is taking place means that a lot of agricultural land has been taken out of production and that gives us more chance to compete agriculturally; and, thirdly, there is a growing middle class in Korea and Japan with discretionary spending power which it is not ploughing into real estate because of certain structural aspects of those economies. A great deal is being spent by individual consumers on energy requirements and higher grade food, such as steak, noodles made from wheat and the like. Once again, Australia has a great potential for being the major exporter to north-east Asia both in terms of clean and fresh Australian agricultural products and our quality coal because we have, over the years, carved out a niche in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that it was John McEwen, a former Leader of the National Party and then Minister for Trade who, in 1957, against the opposition of elements of the Labor Party and the RSL of the day&mdash;we must remember that it was only 12 years after World War II&mdash;forged a trade treaty between Australia and Japan which provided the basis for much of the Queensland economic growth that has occurred in the last two or three decades as well as a great deal of Australian economic growth, Japan being our major trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the prospects for coal exports, north-east Asia remains a major focus for the industry, as does Europe. I say further to the House that there is one thing that we have not yet heard from the Europeans, although we have heard some slight good news from them in the last week in respect of the common agricultural policy, the CAP. We have not heard too much from the Germans about their deep underground coal subsidy levels and alterations to that coal subsidy because the quantum of that subsidy is unbelievably high. I think it exceeds the actual cost of production of an average tonne of Australian coal. Germany will have to face the music on that before much longer. I raised that issue with Chancellor Kohl when I met him in May last year in Crete for the Battle of Crete reunion. I took the opportunity to pursue both the CAP and coal industry issues. Hopefully some progress will be made and Germany will make adjustments to its coal mining subsidy levels in the interests of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations and progressing the trading circumstances of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third dimension I wish to put before the Parliament concerns the importance of research. The changes that the Minister has brought forward under the Coal Research Assistance Amendment Bill represent a privatisation, an industry-controlled fund with certain requirements and obligations. The Bill puts in place safety nets. One of the good fortunes of the coal industry is that it has been a very progressive industry. It has not always got every decision right, especially with regard to transport infrastructure, but equally it has come a long way in the last four decades and all Australians have benefited from that coal industry research. The general reform and boost in productivity is detailed quite clearly in both reports to which I have referred, one of them being the report of the Joint Coal Board which shows that between 1984 and 1991 the annual output per employee increased from about 2,900 tonnes saleable to about 4,700 tonnes. We now have to match best world practice, not just comparable Australian practice. Hopefully, further research and a restructuring of the research effort will provide for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill removes the $50m-odd coal export duty, which is a direct tax on exports and is long overdue for removal. It caught a particular seam of coal, mainly in Queensland, between certain depths&mdash;so well it was targeted as a profit creaming-off tax. Item No. 7 of the Fightback package, a copy of which I just happen to have in my pocket, states very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coal export duty abolished!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eliminates $49 million tax on one of our major export industries.</PARA>
<PARA>We are delivering on that and have provided a funded basis for removing the coal export duty. I would like the Minister to nominate tonight where he will make up the $45m difference. It depends on how it is calculated for the particular year of production. </PARA>

Minister Willis and Treasurer Dawkins today were dancing around on the very question of a tax increase in the next Budget. They have not categorically ruled out a tax increase. Is the Government just going to fudge the books and say, `This is on the never-never and we will provide the funding requirement for the abolition out of the enhanced increased economic growth.'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Government negotiated a package to provide certain additional effort from BHP, which it may have intended to undertake anyway, in relation to the coal industry. It is a very progressive company. I do not think it has to be dragooned into these matters. It is correct policy to abolish the coal export duty. It is in the Government's nature to do a deal and stitch it into a locked-in package of arrangements. We will abolish it. We also welcome the additional investment expenditure by BHP. But that does not answer the question of how exactly the Government intends to fund the additional $50m blow-out on a Budget deficit which has already gone from a prediction in Kerin's Budget last August of $4.6 billion to $6.8 billion and then to $9.3 billion last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a lightly placed question injected into this debate to ask the Minister how this aspect is being funded in detailed terms. I look forward to the Minister's reply. I reaffirm that the Government has stolen one of the seven key planks embraced by Fightback to abolish sales tax, petroleum and fuel excise taxes, payroll tax, lump sum superannuation tax, the training guarantee levy and customs duty. Coal export duty was dealt with under item 7 of the Fightback package. The Government has stolen that plank. We will commend to the Government by way of a second reading amendment that it steal the other six and fund them in the process because all Australians will be the winners from such an approach. Export industries in particular will be the winners. The coal export duty was a direct tax on exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Secretary to Senator Button's Department, Dr John Bell, has pointed out on a number of occasions that the average disadvantage rate created for all our exports as a consequence of the sales tax and related regimes was 5 per cent. That is not my figure; it comes from the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. By abolishing all sales tax, bringing in a VAT and zero rating that VAT so far as coal industry and other exports are concerned, we will provide a framework for further export enhancement and stimulus to our key export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the guillotine is being applied and that others want to speak on this important legislation, which will not be opposed by the Opposition. The coalition, as always, will be very responsible, particularly in relation to this huge decentralised export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are missing links in the industry. One of those is the Goonyella-Newlands railway link from Riverside North in the middle of Queensland. This did not come up for mention in the One Nation statement, but if it were put in place, it would give a three-way linkage to the Queensland coal industry's northern port of Abbot Point and provide some security, flexibility and enhanced exporting capacity. It is something less than 80 kilometres. There have been some studies looking into it, and currently studies are going on. I mention that to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to the House that our second reading amendments, to be moved by myself and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), will in fact pick up on these points.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is not the coal industry; it is several different industries. Essentially it is an export industry divided between coking coal and steaming coal. That is then divided, in each of those categories, between open cut coal and underground coal. The domestic industry is split into coking coal and steaming coal, and again each of those categories is split into underground coal and open cut coal. Effectively we have 10 different industries. It is always generalised and talked about as though we are talking about one industry. Our great difficulty is that 70 per cent of our coal that is mined goes to export. We are a very high export proportion country and, as such, we are very vulnerable to changes in export prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as we have in this country a disorganised, fragmented selling basis, as we now have, and as long as our largest customer&mdash;who buys over 50 per cent of our coal&mdash;is buying on an organised, highly regimented buying basis, we will be exploited and we will never get the best value for this country. I do not care what is said on this side of the House or on the other side of the House, I have seen it for too many decades&mdash;we will be taken to the cleaners at one stage or another over and over again. One only has to go back to the statement, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 May, of Mr Bob Flew of BHP Australia Coal Ltd at the recent coal conference where he cautioned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local producers of thermal coal should be cautious and limit their investment in new projects in order to maintain profitability.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid a repeat of the mistakes of the 1980s, Australian producers or potential producers of thermal coal should adopt a cautious view of bullish world energy projections, and restrict investments to projects low on the production cost curve that will remain profitable through the extremes of normal economic cycles.</PARA>
<PARA>Be sure of this: there will be extremes and they come in cycle after cycle. I have seen them several times. The bullish talk that is about now about expanding coal production and opening up new mines is the classic ploy that has been used, essentially by Japan, to create a bullish market, to engender new production and then, when overproduction comes, to use that overproduction as a means of forcing down the price, leading to the closure of more Australian mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want efficient, competitive production in this country, and we are well on the way to getting that. But we cannot get the best out of our vital natural resource of coal as long as we operate in a totally disorganised, fragmented selling manner where Australian producer competes against Australian producer to the benefit of external purchaser. I would have liked very much to have heard something from the Leader of the National Party about that. Many miners live in country electorates, but not one word was mentioned by the Leader of the National Party about the welfare of miners and their families. I think that says a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in respect of the Joint Coal Board, having had to deal with this industry over the years and having close family connections with the industry, I know that miners are Australians, I know the dangerous conditions under which they work, I know the agony they go through in times of tension and pressure like other Australian workers, but they are demeaned and categorised in a manner by those opposite that makes them think that they are some sort of alien beings. The Joint Coal Board, through all that process of tension within the industry, is the one organisation that has always been trusted by both sides of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that this package of Bills deals with change in the coal industry, and change has been an ongoing process in the coal industry since the first coal was gathered from the shores of Nobbys and exported to Bengal in 1801. I have reservations about some aspects of the legislation, particularly the gutting of the Joint Coal Board. However, since this resulted from an agreement between all the parties, only time will tell whether my fears are justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Miners in the Hunter have embraced workplace changes over recent years which have brought substantial increases in productivity. In 1990-91 the Hunter produced 69.27 million tonnes of coal, equivalent to 86 per cent of New South Wales coal production or 42 per cent of Australian production, mixed between domestic sales and export sales. In 1991 each miner in the Hunter produced an average of 5,014 tonnes of coal, compared with 3,750 tonnes of coal in 1986-87, an increase of 1,264 tonnes of coal per miner per year, or an increase of 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, despite that productivity increase and ongoing improvements in the industry's production processes, miners are losing their jobs and losing their careers as mines continue to close in the northern district. Between 1986-87 and 1990-91, the number of coal employees in the Hunter was cut from 12,634 to 10,477, a reduction of 17 per cent or 2,157 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mine closures can result from the working out of seams or expensive and insurmountable difficulties in the extraction of coal. That can be accepted. But in many cases managerial short-sightedness, managerial incompetence and, in some cases, just plain greed have resulted in premature mine closures and the squandering of millions of tonnes of valuable and non-renewable coal reserves. That irresponsible behaviour by coal proprietors, and the lack of a comprehensive energy or coal mining strategy at either State or Federal level, is allowing millions of tonnes of coal to be left in the ground to be wasted, to be squandered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing loss of jobs and the waste or sterilisation of an increasing quantity of our vital reserves are what have brought more than 100 miners from the Hunter to this Parliament today. Earlier this evening, along with my colleagues the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), I met with Mr Mick Watson, the President of the Northern District Branch of the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia. Earlier, miners from our region held a lamp vigil outside and above this place. They are here as part of their Survival '92 campaign, a non-industrial campaign aimed at securing the future of the coal industry in the Hunter region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter has been hit hard by the short-sightedness, the `Rip it out and sell it to the first bidder, and to hell with the workers!' approach of mine management, which has led to the closure of still commercially viable mines, mines that still had a part to play in Australia's economic prosperity. Lemington Colliery is to close on 1 July. It has 2.4 million tonnes of coal reserves. Bloomfield Colliery is soon to close. It has 7.5 million tonnes of coal reserves. Lambton Colliery, in my own electorate, closed in December 1991. It had 5.5 million tonnes of coal reserves. All three mines have suffered or will suffer from sterilisation because there are no care or maintenance programs under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a mine is shut completely it suffers from rock falls, water seepage and gas build-up. Thus that coal is lost and it is uneconomic to retrieve it. These three closures follow the closure of Burwood, John Darling, Stockton, Wallsend, Stockrington and Aberdare in recent years. More recently, in April, 27 miners were retrenched without warning from the Preston Colliery. The closures of Lemington and Bloomfield will add 250 miners to the retrenched list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other underground mines have suffered heavily with retrenchments. In my own electorate there are seven underground mines, a number of which risk closure and loss of jobs due to the ruthless policy of privatisation from the Greiner Government of New South Wales and in one other case due, I think, to the working out of the seam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Gunnedah a critical situation has been reached where the mine may close if the State Government does not assist with more equitable rail freight charges. If it does not, there may not be funds available to pay out employees. This highlights the need to have an industry fund scheme to ensure that moneys are available to pay employees their proper entitlements in the event of mine closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Survival '92 campaign being mounted by the Miners Federation it is calling for the need for an effective government policy for the future management of our coal resources, thus ensuring a balance between underground and open cut extraction, together with a critical review of any application for new developments. That is good commonsense. I support it. It is in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It expresses the need for a bipartisan overviewing body to ensure that coal price negotiations are conducted under guidelines framed to end results which are in the best interests of the industry as a whole. Again, that request points in my view to the immaturity and the incompetence of many of Australia's coal exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It calls for an advance warning system whereby operations which have had foreseeable problems can be reviewed and solutions sought before the axe falls.

They are jobs that will disappear unless there is an improvement in conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I come to the conclusion of my remarks in this limited debate, I wish to quote from the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>, which was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> and Miners Advocate</EMPHASIS> in earlier years. This journal is not known for radical viewpoints, particularly on issues such this. The editorial of 16 May 1992 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A wasteful loss of coal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is something frighteningly cavalier about the way Hunter underground coal mines are being closed because they are not, for the moment, profitable. Coal companies and governments appear to have forgotten the lessons of mining history. That is a more charitable explanation than the alternative that they do not really care that valuable national resources could be made irrecoverable by their actions. . . Hundreds, and probably thousands, of millions of tonnes of coal have been effectively sterilised by wasteful mining practices in nearly two centuries of coal recovery in the Hunter. With the sophisticated mining techniques available today, there is little excuse for sterilising coal. That costs have exceeded prices for a year or two is certainly no excuse for such a wasteful action.</PARA>
<PARA>In the last part of the editorial it goes on to say that mine owners should not be forced to continue mining coal at a loss, but that, instead of closing mines and locking away coal reserves for good, they could adopt the sensible proposal of the United Mineworkers Federation to put mines on a care-and-maintenance basis. The editorial calls for a small industry levy, preferably administered by a restrengthened Joint Coal Board, that could pay for the scheme which, in the long term, should return much more than its cost. That is good sense, Mr Deputy Speaker. It needs to be addressed in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer to the remarks of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) in respect of the Joint Coal Board and occupational health and safety. If there is one industry in this country where employers cannot be trusted in respect of safe working practices, it is the mining industry. I ask members of this chamber to go down the mines from time to time and have a look for themselves at the working conditions. They should have a look at the structures; have a look at the roof works; have a look at the conditions under which men are clambering around and working. The Leader of the National Party is saying, `Leave it to the mine managers and the mining industry'. That is why we have a Joint Coal Board. I am strongly of the view that occupational health and safety practices should remain with the Joint Coal Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is irresponsible, insulting and dangerous for the Leader of the National Party, who represents many miners in this country, to be suggesting that the mining industry has the sense of responsibility to look after occupational health and safety. There may be some exceptions, but I strongly oppose the view he is putting. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>Our view is that this represents yet another limb of what amounts to de facto compulsory membership of unions in the industry. I know my friends opposite pretend it does not exist, but it does exist in large lumps right through Australian industry, and we have moved this second reading amendment in accordance with our longstanding opposition to that. As my colleague the Leader of the National Party has argued the case in relation to our general approach to this legislation, I simply wanted to make the point that the reason for proposing this second reading amendment is to emphasise yet again the total rejection of any kind of compulsory unionism by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial building industry is an even better example than the coal industry of the undoubted malady of compulsory unionism in Australian society.

It was a function to celebrate the centenary of the commercial building industry in Melbourne, and he turned down the invitation because the organisers had the temerity to invite a man from the United States who had once led a contracting organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This nation must have a wide-ranging debate on the coal industry. I had hoped that we would have that debate tonight. However, these coalmining industry Bills are under guillotine and, tragically, I have no opportunity to address crucial issues such as changes to the Joint Coal Board and long service leave provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with the long service leave legislation&mdash;as a matter of fact, I applaud it&mdash;but I am spitting chips about the emasculation of the Joint Coal Board. The Board played a splendid role, and still has a vital role to play, in promoting a prosperous and profitable coal industry, and a safe coal industry. It angers me that this coalmining industry debate has not been given the same length of time as other debates on important industries such as wool and wheat. We need time for the Parliament to debate the type of nonsense spoken by the Opposition. I cannot understand why people would come out and castigate miners to the extent that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) racing around the countryside talking about trains, but also, in lighter moments, serving out a decent swipe at the miners. What those opposite want to do is abolish completely the Joint Coal Board. What they want to do is wipe from the face of the earth the Coal Industry Tribunal. Furthermore, they want to abolish completely this Federal Government's right to veto coal export sales which are not in the national interest. Honestly, one could only form the conclusion that those opposite do not care a hoot about the miners. They do not care a hoot about the safety of miners, because, after all, miners are labourers, and labourers are an alien spirit in the minds of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the conservative colleagues of the Leader of the National Party protect their natural constituency&mdash;the top end of town. They will never give a sympathetic thought to the mining fraternity. Coal is a national industry and our nation's major export earner. But, as is so often the case, within an industry there is plenty of competition&mdash;competition from other coal-producing countries and regional competition from within. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a New South Wales constituency in which coal is crucial to economic well-being, a constituency in which coal is crucial to employment. Coal has had its boom times and its bust times. It has had its roof falls, fires, dustings, gassings, explosions and deaths. Coal went through mechanisation, which cut a swathe through its work force. Coal towns stood poised to become ghost towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some coal areas succumbed to trials, tribulations and tragedies. Coal in those areas lost its crown. But coal survived in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales and coal remains king in Cessnock, Maitland, Kurri Kurri, Singleton, Newcastle, Muswellbrook and many other Hunter cities and towns. In retaining its crown, the coal industry has given birth to the finest and friendliest body of men and women it would be possible to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking on these Bills I represent the interests of the coalminers in the Hunter Valley, and I do so with a great deal of pride. I mentioned earlier that there is plenty of competition with the Australian coal industry from other countries. I mention also that there is plenty of competition within Australia, coming from different coal producing regions. We are indeed one nation, and it is important that we think of ourselves as such and work together in the national interest. However, within every country there will be a degree of regional competition, which can be healthy in some instances. For instance, it was competition which caused the Hunter to develop and become the promoter and producer of the finest wine that this nation or any other nation can produce. However, regional competition will be healthy in the Australian coalmining industry only if each region is given the opportunity to operate on the level playing field and State and Federal governments strive to ensure that any reforms effected satisfy a number of criteria which create a fair and safe working environment for miners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalmining presents a harsh and hazardous working environment, particularly in underground mines. Historically, that environment has been made even less attractive because of the difficult relationships between miners and management. Those relationships have improved dramatically in recent times, but miners have long memories and it is not surprising that they are fiercely protective of hard-won rights and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the subject of regional competition in the coal industry, it is the time to say that the greatest threat to the New South Wales coal industry and the jobs within it is the Queensland coal industry. Bearing that in mind, it is not surprising that coalminers in the Hunter Valley did not clap their hands in glee when the Minister signed a memorandum of understanding with BHP-Utah Coal Ltd, effectively abolishing the coal export levy. The coal export duty was an inequitable and potentially distortional tax. Since 1984 only six open-cut mines operated by BHP-Utah have paid the export duty. Levied at $3.50 per tonne on exported coal, the tax raised about $48m per year. Because it had taxes of $48m per year waived, BHP-Utah gave in return. The company provided commitments to invest $248m over the next five years. That is a fair deal because, instead of paying the tax, the company will effect significant efficiency gains, improve regional employment opportunities and provide environmental benefits for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the crux of the matter. I told 200 miners outside this House this evening, when they hooted and shouted about the deal we did for the abolition of the coal export duty which benefited Queensland, that only six mines in Australia were paying that duty, that they were all in Queensland and that that was not a fair crack of the whip. Maybe they understood that, but when we mention Queensland we must understand the psychology of the New South Wales miners, who correctly see the Queensland mining industry as the greatest threat to mining in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Minister is certainly justified in seeing these arrangements as typifying the mutual gains that can be made when governments work closely with industry to remove sectoral impediments. However, as I have said, many miners in the Hunter and other coal areas of New South Wales believe that the deal arranged with BHP-Utah had a ripple effect which rocked and may well wreck the viability of underground mines in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant, and probably a coincidence, that BHP-Utah, flush with funds due to the repeal of the coal export duty, led the field in the most recent contract settlement with Japanese buyers. BHP-Utah's capitulation and premature acceptance of the low coal prices offered placed an increased and dangerous pressure on New South Wales mines which were producing similar ranked coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few underground mines in the Hunter have hit the wall, and there is a very real fear that other underground mines will be forced to make severe cutbacks in present employment levels. The long term future for the Hunter coal industry is most promising, with major developments planned in new mine areas. However, the new mine openings are some time away and the ranks of out-of-work miners could swell to intolerable levels in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment in the recession-hit Hunter Valley is above the national average, and massive job losses in the mining sector would have a catastrophic effect on the local communities. The economic rationalists have decimated the textile and clothing industry work force in the Hunter. We as a government must make certain that we prevent the coal mines in the Hunter and other areas of New South Wales going down the same path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive members of the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia have displayed admirable restraint and exhibited a large degree of sound commonsense in embarking on a campaign to assist its cause. The northern miners are worried about their position, but they have not attempted to flex their industrial muscle. Survival '92 is a sensible but desperate cry for help&mdash;help to maintain our greatest export industry. Miners are quietly and rationally gathering community support for their position, through a public education campaign, to heighten awareness of the extent to which every community in the Hunter is dependent on coal incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take away the jobs of the miners and the jobs of the men and women in industries related to mining, the Hunter Valley will become an economic wasteland. The mining unions are acting very responsibly in seeking to work in harmony with the Federal and State governments and the Coal Association to minimise the employment consequences of short term difficulties. I and my colleagues who represent coal mining areas in New South Wales will be calling on the Government to assist unemployed miners as jobs go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative that this Government provide structural adjustment funds. Appropriate structural adjustment funds must be made available to cater for the needs of mining communities. Appropriate structural adjustment funds must be made available to ensure that irreplaceable general mining skills are not lost. The mining industry has been fortunate in having the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) as successive Ministers for Primary Industries and Energy. Both Ministers have worked tirelessly to assist the mining industry. But the position remains that companies are closing marginal mines in the search for cheaper coal, thereby losing forever hundreds of millions of tonnes of coal remaining in those mines&mdash;coal which will never be recovered. The mines will never be reopened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must find solutions which will stabilise the coal industry and protect for future generations those valuable coal reserves which will otherwise be lost.

I want to make those remarks in the context of being a representative of people involved in coalmining in the northern end of New South Wales, around Gunnedah.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who represents the area from Muswellbrook north, I have something of an interest in this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refute any suggestion by the two speakers from the other side of the House who have spoken in this debate that we on this side are not concerned about the future of the coal industry.

It is of vital importance to the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is, of course, that underground mining in particular faces some particularly difficult problems. To that end, outside the House today a group of people attempted to highlight some of the problems that they face. A recent editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Namoi Valley Independent</EMPHASIS> summed it up in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry is never stable. It is a turbulent industry, with high labour and recovery costs and variable returns. In the last decade, there have been only short periods when the industry has been in the black. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional underground mining methods have come under increasing pressure, because of the higher labour component, the complexities of extraction, the physical barriers, such as dykes and extrusions in the coal seams, and the variable quality. As pressure grows on returns to coal producers, underground mining becomes a less attractive option. The point has been reached where virtually every underground mine in Australia is struggling for survival and all the expansion is occurring in open cut mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That explains why close to $60 million has been spent at the Vickery open cut near Gunnedah . . . and why 27 miners were laid off at Preston underground mine last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term danger, though, is that years, perhaps decades, down the track, the state's easily accessible coal will have been worked out. Perhaps, by then, alternative power sources will have been found&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>certainly not under this Government, but they may be found&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and coal extraction, by any means, will no longer be needed. But what will happen if coal is still the main power and energy source? All the "easy" reserves will have been exhausted and mining companies will have to resort to underground extraction. By that time, however, the expertise and methodology in underground mining, built up over more than 100 years, will have disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have a poor track record in industry assistance. The coal mining industry could tear itself to shreds, unless a concerted effort is made to restore profitability.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we would all concur with that. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it was pointed out recently, it's no consolation to retrenched miners for Gunnedah to be known as the Coalfield of the Future. There is no future, unless the industry is able to survive.</PARA>
<PARA>Lest I be accused again by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) of being on another union bash&mdash;although he always seems to follow me in these debates, he preceded me today; and he always makes the point that I raise these issues&mdash;I will be very quick to point out that I frankly believe that many of the union representatives who have to deal with companies and workers in the Gunnedah area in respect of these issues have been extremely responsible. I commend them for it. In fact, I could go so far as to say that the companies that have had to deal with them would want that to be acknowledged and put on the record. I have met with some of those representatives. I will meet with them again both tomorrow and, when I have the opportunity, back in my home area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that some of the confrontationist and misleading information dished up by some other more remote union representatives serves to do nothing other than keep alive the old hatreds and irrelevancies and, if you like, even the old nonsensical class distinctions based on some sort of belief that somehow we must fight and compete amongst ourselves rather than playing as a team and opposing other teams. Of course, in an export industry that means basically opposing those nations with which we compete for markets in places such as Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find referred to me, from a magazine entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Cause</EMPHASIS>, an article by the General Secretary&mdash;I do not see any point in naming him here&mdash;which causes me some distress. It is headed, `Keating and Hewson offer us a real and vital choice'. That, of course, is true: there is a real and vital choice. The General Secretary goes on to say that that has not been the case during most of the 1980s. He claims that the two parties have been very close to one another and that the differences have been hard to distinguish. However, he says that it is essential that we now understand clearly that there is a great difference and that we need to look at those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fine as far as it goes. The problem is that he misrepresents the differences. He misrepresents our position and, I believe, very clearly fails to highlight the advantages that even the Government's own Treasury indicates will flow to the mining industry and, therefore, short circuits the debate. It is reminiscent of the lately departed Minister, Senator Richardson, who, in the town of Mudgee, recently incited a group of Labor people on a delegation not to worry about debating the issues of the Opposition's goods and services tax proposals rationally. He said, `Just use fear. That's all you've got to do; use fear'. Of course, misinformation is the main vehicle by which fear can be promoted. Unfortunately, this article falls into that category. For example, the General Secretary states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor sees the need for continued workplace reform and increased productivity to be achieved through the involvement of employers, unions and Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine as far as it goes, but it overlooks the fact that we have seen precious little progress. This is confirmed by the recent OECD report on Australia which commented that our transport, ports and Public Service are still only about 50 per cent as efficient as similar services in foreign competitor nations. Where is the reform? Where is the sense of urgency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article goes on to say that the Government also favours decentralisation and growth in regional areas. I can only say that here we have clear evidence, in terms of the problems that the coal industry is facing in rural Australia, of just the opposite happening&mdash;the dying of the bush; the death of rural Australia&mdash;under the policies being pursued by the current Government. He goes on to say that his union is opposed to privatisation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor under Keating is still committed to an ongoing program of privatisation that our union does not agree with. However, the Labor program still retains public ownership of some of our biggest enterprises, such as Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hewson's Liberals want to privatise all Government businesses, including massively profitable assets like Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting that the recent OECD report, to which I just referred, indicated that Telecom was perhaps the least efficient and cost-effective of nine similar carriers which were studied recently by the OECD. The General Secretary goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big difference for most people in the economic policies of both Labor and the Liberals is taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is technically correct as well. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is opposed to a Goods and Services Tax (GST). The Economic Statement provides for middle income personal tax cuts;</PARA>
<PARA>He conveniently forgets to say that there are no tax cuts mentioned for low income earners. He also conveniently forgets to point out that those tax cuts increasingly look to be very elusive indeed, given that they were to be funded by bracket creep which now will not flow because of the lower inflationary estimates. The growth projections of 4.75 per cent were optimistic by anybody's standards, but in terms of the increase in growth, which we are now supposed to see and which will help to pay for those tax cuts, those tax cuts obviously become highly illusory indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The General Secretary goes on to say, `Labor would retain payroll tax, excise and sales taxes'&mdash;as though that is something to boast about. He then goes on to point out that the Opposition wants to introduce a 15 per cent goods and services tax. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would be a harsh blow against the majority of Australians, but particularly cruel to those on fixed incomes, especially pensioners and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>What I find offensive about this is that if he were really interested in a fair dinkum debate he would acknowledge that they are to be fully compensated. Even if he wanted to argue the point about whether it was adequate compensation, he makes no mention of the 8 per cent increase scheduled for pensioners and returned veterans, and 6 per cent for other beneficiaries. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To sweeten the pill, Hewson offers personal tax cuts and the abolition of payroll tax, excise and sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no analysis of the value of those either to his members or to their prospects of retaining their employment opportunities. I think that is unfair, to put it mildly, and irresponsible in terms of his responsibility to his members and their needs and the obligation that he should have to put the reality before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he saves his most serious representations, perhaps predictably, for the area of industrial relations. Of course, his line here is to simply and rather glibly point out that we are going to do a big New Zealand job here. He goes on to drag out all the old furphies: for example, wages have been slashed in New Zealand by 25 per cent. A quick look at today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> will establish that in most of the enterprise agreements that have been entered into in New Zealand there have been modest pay increases, which really puts a lie to the furphies that are being put about New Zealand, just to mention one thing alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could look then at the other issues he raises. He says there have been massive cutbacks in social welfare, health and public education and that unemployed people in New Zealand often have to wait up to six months for benefits. Like so much of the scare campaign being run by the labour movement in its various guises, that completely overlooks the fact that New Zealand's crippling international debt&mdash;far worse even than ours in relative terms&mdash;has been primarily responsible for that collapse. In fact, the reforms it has undertaken are now beginning to bear fruit. He ought to have pointed that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is highly significant that last month for the first time since 1973 New Zealand recorded a trade surplus. That really ought to be engraved on the heart of every Australian, because we still face chronic difficulties with no real evidence of a turnaround in this very critical area of our economic performance. New Zealand is slowly beginning to turn the corner. It has been through enormous difficulties, but in a way in which we can only admire in many respects it has tackled some of the enormous difficulties that it has faced. Nobody pretends it has been easy. Much of it in New Zealand has had anything but to do with the question of industrial relations and tax reform. It has had to do with the fact that New Zealand was in a far worse financial mess than we were when we started. But it is turning things around. A fair assessment of what is happening in New Zealand should acknowledge that. I leave that subject there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that many of the unions and the union representatives involved in the problems of the northern coalfields have been highly responsible. But I make the point that if people such as the individual responsible for this article really have the interests of their members at heart and not just their own positions they ought to be keen to establish two general points of integrity. The first is that they need to be more honest about the Opposition's policies and to fall into line, if you like, with the Prime Minister's promise before Christmas when he became Prime Minister that from now on we would be honest with the Australian people. The second thing is, again in the context of his concern to do something about extracting a better deal from the Government, that he really ought to be saying, `What are you going to do to match the undoubted assistance for the coal industry that is contained in the policies of Fightback?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look very briefly at some of the facts. Treasury's estimates of the savings for the mining industry come to almost $700m, mainly as a result of the abolition of payroll tax, fuel excise and the wholesale sales tax. The northern coalfields in my electorate quite simply would benefit enormously from the abolition of the seven taxes we are talking about here. I actually believe in all honesty, in all integrity, that it would mean the difference between opening and closing for many of them. It is as simple as that&mdash;jobs or no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One simple example is that for one company which is forking out $7m per annum in wages at the moment payroll tax savings come to $500,000 per year. Add the fuel excise plus the payroll tax abolition savings for rail and for trucking transport and we have an enormous equation of assistance by virtue of cutting costs, as I said a moment ago, that I frankly believe will mean the difference between survival and death for many of these mines and the jobs that go with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to address very briefly the Opposition's earlier amendment in regard to the long service leave provisions. There are two fundamental flaws in that amendment. Firstly, it misunderstands what the legislation in fact says. When the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was in the House&mdash;he is not now&mdash;he made some pretty wild allegations to the effect that the Bills were designed to provide the basis for compulsory unionism in the coal industry vis-a-vis long service leave. I draw his attention and that of the Opposition to the fact that, whilst the second reading speech did refer to awards of the Commission, it went on to recognise that, where such payments are made arising out of an obligation under a recognised enterprise or workplace agreement, reimbursement may also be claimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I do not understand the purpose of that amendment brought forward by the Opposition tonight, because it really says that `long service leave provisions should not be limited to those employees to whom an award, determination order or agreement applies'. What is an enterprise agreement if it is not an agreement? The assertion that is being made is that somehow we have inveigled into this legislation some surreptitious approach to compulsory unionism. I simply point out that any attempt to read the legislation itself will show that the definition of `relevant industrial agreement' is, `an award or determination made, order given or agreement approved by or registered with, an industrial authority . . . '. The definition of `industrial authority' on the previous page includes the New South Wales Industrial Commission, which recognises industrial agreements that do not have to involve the union. So, as I say, not only is it creating straw men but also it is deliberately misleading to assert, as the honourable member for Bennelong did in his contribution, that these Bills provide for compulsory unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that this legislation does not create of itself an entitlement to long service leave. It merely provides a means of guaranteeing funding of existing entitlements in the black coal mining industry, whether they arise under awards, agreements, enterprise agreements, individual contracts or any combination of these that are capable of being addressed under the State as well as the Commonwealth jurisdiction. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Bills, which give effect to the Government's proposals to reform the funding of long service leave in the black coalmining industry, were introduced, representations have been received from the New South Wales Coal Association and the Queensland Mining Council about the meaning of the words used in paragraph (b) of the definition of `eligible employee' in clause 4 of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paragraph is coextensive with five other paragraphs in clause 4, which together provide the basis for determining which employees in the black coalmining industry are to be covered by the national scheme for securing funding of long service leave entitlements in the industry. Here I note in passing that the legislation does not itself create an entitlement to long service leave. The legislation merely provides for the creation of the fund, upon which employees will be able, as the need arises, to obtain reimbursement for funds made to eligible employees in respect of long service leave entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed that the absence of the words `in the black coalmining industry' from the definition of `eligible employee' in paragraph (b) may be construed as having the effect of widening the definition to include persons not presently covered under longstanding arrangements within the industry. This is not the intended effect of the legislation. The words already appearing in the paragraph in question, when read together with the objects of the Act which are set out in clause 3 of the legislation, limit the classes of worker who may be regarded as eligible employees for the purposes of the Act to persons employed in the black coalmining industry. The addition of the words `in the black coalmining industry' to paragraph (b) accordingly serves no useful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wishes to make it clear that it is not its intention to extend the coverage of the scheme beyond persons who are currently regarded as being engaged in the black coalmining industry. What may be described as the boundaries of the black coalmining industry vary within and between States and are to a significant extent determined by custom and practice reflecting a range of considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, accordingly, provides for a means including or excluding limited numbers of workers from the scheme but not from entitlements to long service leave by regulation, as is provided under paragraphs (d) and (f) of clause 4. The Government will, reflecting the provisions of the legislation and the cooperative nature of the scheme, consult with representatives of all interests likely to be affected by the making of such legislation. This will allow the industry some flexibility in regulating its affairs, while safeguards to protect the interests of any individuals who may be affected are retained and regulations that are made in respect of the coverage of the scheme will of course be disallowable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to agree with much of what the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said until the last part of his speech. I agreed with him when he said that we do not know what the energy future holds for us. At some time we may need that coal, and some of the very best coal in Australia today is sterilised. We will never be able to recover that coal. That is a great pity. I have always argued that we should have not only a national energy policy in Australia, but also a national coal plan. We should know exactly where we are going with coal, what coal we have and what the long term future is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) talked about a railway line in Queensland. He knows this area. It was a criminal act that the Maldon-Dumbarton railway line in New South Wales was stopped. We are talking about export of coal. We have the coal loader at Port Kembla. We have that line half finished. A lot of the most difficult part is finished. If the New South Wales Government will not fund the line, I appeal to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, and the Federal Government to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was bitterly disappointed that it was not included in that document, and I have conveyed that to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I believe that we have to finish that line, which is a coal export line. It would stop those coal trains coming from the western fields, trundling through the Sydney suburban network and trundling down the south coast line, which is ready to fall down at any time. One would get all those coal lines off the Sydney suburban network and put them on the Maldon-Dombarton line and it would be a great boost to Australia's coal export trade. I urge that much more serious consideration be given to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that we have lost half the work force in the coal industry in the Illawarra area. But I am one who believes that coal has a great future. We must not go gung ho at it. As the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has said, the Japanese have shown in the past that they talk up a production level. We overproduce and then they use that against us. I appeal to the Minister, as I have appealed to every Minister in his portfolio, not to listen to the bureaucrats on the National Coal Authority; they will shaft it. They have shafted it with every Minister. It is the only way that we can really get the correct price for coal and can negotiate. The Japanese understand negotiating from a united body. They do it to our negotiators there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to look very carefully at our having a national coal authority that can act in the selling of our coal, especially to the Japanese, and get the very best deal for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendment to the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. I will not take too long in the House, but, given that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) asked the question about coal export duty, I want to put a couple of things on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Government did not adopt the coalition's statement in relation to the abolition of the coal export duty from Fightback. The negotiations with BHP-Utah commenced well in advance of Fightback being produced and correspondence that I have made public attests to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the approach to us in relation to this tax makes a fundamental difference between what we say and deliver versus what the coalition promises. It should not be forgotten&mdash;and it has not been forgotten by the industry&mdash;that the promise the Opposition has in Fightback was also a promise it gave during the 1975 election which it did not deliver on in 1977 and, in fact, some time in the late 1970s, the Opposition increased the coal export duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's credentials are not that good and that is understood by the industry. On the other hand, the Government said to the industry that it recognised the inefficiency, but wanted to address that impediment in the context of getting significant national interest benefits. The national interest was a $250m package commitment of investment in exchange for the forgoing of revenue of $47m, roughly some $120m in the form of new investment in mining and the remainder, some $66m, in research and development, which is of benefit to more than just the Queensland coal industry, because it comes back to the importance of research and development. I believe there is a strong future for the coal industry, particularly if it develops the clean coal technologies, strategically links with the user end of the industry and builds on our strength as clean, low sulphur, low ash producers of coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the agreement that we were able to reach with BHP-Utah was in relation to rehabilitation. In many senses, it is the ecologically sustainable development process in practice. One need look no further than the statement made by Bob Flew from BHP-Utah when he said in relation to those commitments, `But for our preparedness to abolish and enter into agreement to abolish the coal export duties, those investments would not have been made'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in grants in 1986-87 is believed to be a continuing impact of legislative changes from 6 June 1985 which varied the eligibility criteria for the T&amp;PI rate pension, and not a direct result of the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The Commercial Support Program methodology and evaluation process takes into account the ability of Australian industry to support non-core Defence activities where it is operationally feasible, practicable and cost effective to do so. There is no reason to doubt the ability of aviation related industry in Australia to adequately support the ADF, given for example, the recent award of a pilot flight screening and initial flight training contract under the Commercial Support Program, and industry's past involvement, for example in aircraft modification and maintenance and repair programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WD4">Ms Fatin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. The honourable member may however be referring to the educational materials produced for the Working Families: Sharing the Load Program, which I launched on 9 April in Sydney. These materials provided to the honourable member were produced by the Office of the Status of Women, under ILO Convention No 156 on Workers with Family Responsibilities, and are complementary to the workplace initiatives being undertaken by the Work and Family Unit in the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) One of the major aims of the ILO 156 Convention on Workers with Family Responsibilities is to promote community awareness and attitudinal change which will minimise the pressures faced by workers with family responsibilities. Much of the implementation of the Convention is being co-ordinated through the Department of Industrial Relations' Work and Family Unit. Legislative and workplace reform will need to be complemented by new patterns of organisation and sharing by individual family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Status of Women has received funding to conduct a community education program over three years to specifically address the issue of women's double load of paid and unpaid work. International and Australian research demonstrates that although women are moving into the workforce in increasing numbers, they are continuing to carry the vast majority of domestic responsibilities as well. This burden is not only affecting women's capacity to take full advantage of equal employment opportunities, but it is also taking its toll on health, relationships and on family life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Materials developed by OSW have been welcomed by a wide range of community and government bodies as there is a dearth of educational resources addressing work/family issues. Marriage Guidance Australia, an organisation at the front line of relationship counselling, and similar groups around the country have received the materials with enthusiasm, expressing relief that this enormously common problem of balancing work and family is finally being recognised and addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double load has been identified as a concern around the world. In 1991, Mr. Francis Blanchard, Special Advisor to the Secretary General of the OECD and former Director General of the International Labour Organisation, chaired a high-level group of experts which reported on directions to encourage structural change to improve the status of women, which included finding a better balance of work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The educational materials produced by OSW carry the endorsement of the 1994 UN International Year of the Family as they are consistent with its aims to foster equality between women and men within families and bring about a fuller sharing of domestic responsibilities and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) In March 1990 the former Prime Minister announced that the Government would ratify ILO Convention No 156 and fund a community education program in OSW to assist in implementing the Convention. The Government also established the Work and Family Unit in the Department of Industrial Relations, with responsibility for the development of an implementation strategy for the Convention across Commonwealth policies and programs. OSW's Working Families Program is one element in this strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Requests for the materials have come in from a wide cross section of the community including universities and schools, libraries, government offices, health centres, private companies and the media, local and overseas. The materials developed for the Program here received public support from a range of people volunteering as role models for the Program. These included media personalities Geraldine Doogue and George Negus, Jennifer Rowe from the Australian Women's Weekly, AFL footballer Simon Madden, Don Edgar from the Australian Institute of Family Studies and Michael Bittman from the University of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes. OSW falls within the portfolio responsibility of the Prime Minister and also myself in my capacity as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) See (b) above. I repeat that the Government is fully committed to implementing ILO 156. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) AWRC has offered surplus cars to persons being made redundant in cases where such persons had a car as part of their remuneration package in the former Australian Wool Corporation (AWC).  Such offers apply only to the vehicle assigned to that individual by the former AWC.  Initially such cars were sold to redundant persons at their written down value.  In December it was resolved that market value should be taken into account where it exceeded the written down value.  For each vehicle two independent valuations are received and the person may be offered the vehicle at the lower of these two values provided it exceeds the written down value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other vehicles surplus to the requirements of the three organisations have been offered for sale to staff.  The offer price is set at the highest of three valuations received from the trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) With the establishment of the new AWC on 1 July 1991, all staff positions were newly created.  Mr Peter Wallis was appointed to the position of General Manager, Industry Services and his previous car was replaced in accordance with the Corporation's car replacement policy.  In summary that policy directs that when a vehicle reaches the age of three years or 80,000 kilometres, whichever comes first, it will be  replaced with a vehicle of Australian manufacture of the same value as that of other staff at the same level of seniority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The AWC is not the retrenching body.  Mr Rowe, an employee of the former AWC accepted a redundancy payment from the AWRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Mr Rowe was retrenched by the AWRC on 29 November 1991. Subsequently, on 6 December 1991, Mr Rowe accepted an offer of a temporary consultancy assignment on a part-time basis with the AWRC.  The assignment was for a specific task which is substantially different from his former job, but for which he was judged to be uniquely qualified.  The task is a temporary one and due to be complete before the end of June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) During his period of employment with the former AWC Mr Rowe was provided with the use of a Corporation Vehicle as part of his remuneration. Mr Rowe has not been provided with a car as part of his current temporary assignment with the AWRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No other person who has accepted a redundancy payment from the AWRC has been re-employed by the new AWC, by the AWRC or by the Wool Research and Development Corporation  (WRDC) as a consultant.  The AWRC engaged one other redundant person on a part-time casual basis in February, but this appointment has recently been terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) On 1 July the former AWC was abolished and the AWRC became its legal successor and employer of all staff.  Those staff were then provisionally allocated between the AWRC, the AWC and the WRDC.  The three new organisations offered many of those staff permanent positions.  Staff not offered positions in the new AWC or WRDC and not required for the ongoing functions of the AWRC, have been offered and accepted voluntary redundancy.  This will result in an overall reduction in numbers of around 40%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a few instances, the duties attached to positions in the new structure were quite different from those that previously existed and required different levels of skills.  In some cases it was not possible to fill these positions from the ranks of former employees of the old AWC and thus the AWC recruited externally.  The WRDC also recruited externally to fill one newly created communications/public relations position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The new AWC, AWRC and WRDC, have only been in existence since 1 July 1991 and all positions in each organisation may be regarded as new.  The new AWC currently has an establishment of 173.  The AWRC will have 95 staff upon completion of the redundancy program.  The WRDC has an establishment of 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(a) As reported in the 1990/91 Annual Report of the former AWC, salaries and wages amounted to $24.24 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Budgeted salaries, wages and on costs for the AWRC for 1991/92 are $5.6 million, excluding payments made as a  result of redundancies.  Budgeted salaries and on costs for the new AWC for 1991/92 is $10.3 million.  Budgeted salaries and on costs for the WRDC for 1991/92 is $1.0m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) It is presumed that by "the new organisation" the AWRC, the new AWC and the WRDC are meant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Receipts to the AWRC from the 9 percent wool tax levied on wool sold during 1991/92 will not cover the operating expenses of the AWRC for the same period.  The shortfall will be made up by other income sources and from accrued income from wool tax in respect of wool sold late in the 1990/91 season.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgeted expenditure for the AWC for 1991/92 is $25 million and the AWC contribution to the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) is $160 million. The expected income for 1991/92 from the 2.5% wool promotion levy is $68 million.  Hence, the total expenditure of $185 million is only partly funded by the levy, with the remaining funding from the Government contribution ($30 million), interest income ($8 million), and a rundown in reserves of $80 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expected income for the WRDC for 1991/92 from the 0.5% wool research and development levy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is $13.7m.  The remaining income is made up of $13.7 matching Commonwealth funding, $4.1m in interest received and $3.3m in unused grants, royalties, and asset sales.  Budgeted expenditure is $53.6m, and the shortfall of $18.8m is funded by a rundown in reserves.</PARA>
