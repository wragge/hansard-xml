<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill today. Before I get to the Bill itself, I might say that I have read and re-read the speech given by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) on this particular piece of legislation when we last sat on 4 June. I found what he had to say in relation to the Bill itself and in relation to the comments made by the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), to be quite extraordinary and in fact somewhat patronising. I will quote the comments of the honourable member for Higgins, the shadow Attorney-General, to set the record straight:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may not have known what she was reading, but at least she read the right speech. She was a step ahead of Senator Tate who put in the wrong one. She is off to a good start. She does not need to know what she is reading, but I will give her a word of advice: when they come to you with a speech, you  say to them, `Is this the right one?'. That is what you have to say to them because they may in fact give you the wrong one and you would not know.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on and attempted to give the Minister some further advice. I find it very interesting that the shadow Attorney embarked upon giving the Minister advice, particularly when the shadow Attorney has been described by numerous people as perhaps the biggest underachiever in the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found his comments to be somewhat disturbing. I found them to be quite smarmy, self-righteous and, indeed, patronising. They were also incorrect and did not bear out the facts. A letter has been sent from the office of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to the shadow Attorney setting out the correct facts in relation to this particular matter. I believe it is incumbent upon me to set out for the House the facts, to put paid to the smarmy and patronising comments that were made on 4 June by the shadow Attorney. The facts are set out in this letter. I quote part of the letter to the honourable member for Higgins, the shadow Attorney, from the office of the Minister for Justice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the type-written speech given to Senator Tate by Senate Table Office staff at the time of introduction of the Bill was the correct version of the speech (i.e. identical in all relevant respects to that delivered by the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the House last night). It was that speech which the Minister saw and which he requested be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that speech was then passed to Hansard staff within the Senate Chamber for inclusion in the Hansard record in accordance with the directions of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">through inadvertence on the part of Hansard, a "disc" version of what was assumed to be the correct second reading speech was scanned by Hansard staff for inclusion in the record. In fact this was an earlier version of the speech which had been withdrawn by the Government some days previously.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . despite this, the withdrawn version of the speech was wrongly identified by Hansard staff as being the correct version for inclusion in Hansard and it was so included.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Secretary of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has now accepted that there was an error in the transcription of the speech and has apologised to Senator Tate for his Department's mistake.</PARA>
<PARA>I have little doubt that the shadow Attorney-General will feel that it is incumbent upon him to apologise to the Minister in relation to the comments that she gave on 4 June and the comments that he made in relation to this matter on 4 June. I look forward to hearing from the Minister as to whether or not he has had the guts to apologise to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I note that Senator Bronwyn Bishop made a number of comments in the Senate on the shadow Attorney-General's contribution to the Bill. High praise from Senator Bishop is high praise indeed. I guess it is a bit like being a member of the National Party in Queensland&mdash;no-one really takes it very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers throughout my electorate of Kennedy and across Australia will certainly have much stronger and clearer rights against manufacturers of defective products as a result of this legislation. I think it is fair to say that this Bill will certainly advance the rights of those Australians who suffer bodily injury or some loss in relation to their property as a result of a product being put into the marketplace which does not meet the standard of safety a person is generally entitled to expect. If a manufacturer does not design the product correctly&mdash;that is, if he does not have adequate quality control processes during the manufacturing stage and does not accompany the product with sufficient or adequate information and warnings as it goes go into the marketplace to be purchased&mdash;then, as a result of this Bill, manufacturers will have to bear the cost of such injury as is caused by the defective product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that this Bill is a radical improvement on the current mishmash of product liability law. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said over and over again, both in this House and outside the House, we are a government which actually does things, changes things. This legislation is a clear example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that this legislation is further evidence of another clear distinction between the policies of this Government and those opposite. This Bill involved wide consultation between the Government, the manufacturing industry and consumer groups. I think it is fair to say that those opposite do not like consultation. Their industrial relations policies and their policies on zero tariffs at all costs make this brutally clear. We only have to speak to the sugar growers, the dairy industry and others involved in rural industries in this country to ascertain that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill addresses a longstanding problem in the law of product liability and inequity, which this Government decided to act upon and remedy. A substantial body of law already exists giving an array of legal rights to people injured by products. Aspects of contract law, the law of torts, the Trade Practices Act and its State equivalents are relevant to product liability. The determination of which of these areas of law apply depends on the relationship between the manufacturer and the injured party. I guess this is significant as it means different legal tests are applied, which can ultimately mean the difference between extensive damages or no damages at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many products are made for children, but they are bought and paid for by others, such as parents or grandparents. This effectively, I believe, makes most children and other people not in the habit of buying goods second-class citizens under the existing law. I am pleased to say that this Bill will change that. In fact, this Bill will make it very clear that, if a manufacturer puts a defective product into the marketplace and that defective product causes an injury, the manufacturer will have to pay compensation to the person who has suffered bodily injury or some damage, and it will be irrelevant whether or not the injured party purchased the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, I think, is very sensibly based on the 1985 European directive on product liability. As the Minister said on 4 June, central to the European model is its acceptance of the existence of a defect as a necessary precondition to recovery. One of the key features of this Bill as a result of its introduction into the House is that a manufacturer or importer of goods is to be held to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Of course, goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which a person is generally entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances, including the way the goods were marketed and labelled and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. Of course, this is an objective test. It is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is indeed defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the injured party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having mentioned the injured party, I think it should be said that the injured party will not have to prove negligence, which was in the past, as I said earlier, one of the factors identified in the existing law which could well lead to an injustice. Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent. Of course, the injured party will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the product supplied by the manufacturer was defective and that that defect in the product was the cause of the injury or loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does this Bill amend a clear inequity, but it amends that inequity in a way that assists Australian manufacturers with their export initiatives. The 1985 European directive on product liability, as I have previously mentioned, has rapidly established itself as the emerging international standard, and most significantly not only in Europe but also in our own region. As the Minister for Justice said in the Senate in his second reading speech, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are all showing an interest in taking the European directive as a model for their laws relating to product liability. Of course, what this means is that Australian manufacturers can now be confident that, if their products are good enough for the home market, they are also good enough for export. This is clearly in line with one of the main objectives of the Federal Government's industry and economic policies, which has been to promote an environment in which Australian manufacturers are encouraged to export their products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this Bill will encourage manufacturers to reassess their design processes, their quality control and, I believe, their entire operations. Manufacturers will, as Senator Tate has already said in the Senate, upgrade their operations in a way which will not only reduce their insurance premiums but also bring them into conformity with the expectations underlying the Parliament's passing of this Bill so that goods are not put into the marketplace which fall short of the standard of safety which the community generally is entitled to expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interests of the manufacturing industry have certainly been taken into account throughout the lengthy consultation processes that have preceded this Bill into the House. As I have said, that certainly is in stark contrast to the views of the Opposition in relation to the consultation process. I think it is fair to say that we have already seen an Australian Law Reform Commission report in relation to this piece of legislation; an Industries Assistance Commission, as it then was, economic impact study and, of course, various consumer group studies; as well as Australia-wide consultations undertaken personally by the Minister and his Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That consultation process resulted in a number of changes to the Bill and the referral of three issues to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Bill as it stands goes a long way towards addressing the inequities and injustices of the previous product liability regime. It makes the whole process of justice for an injured consumer far more understandable and achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that, while this Government is acting to preserve and strengthen the rights of consumers by this Bill, the coalition, although I understand that it is supporting the Bill, wants to decimate consumers, particularly those in rural and remote parts of Australia, by imposing this hideous 15 per cent consumption tax on the necessities of life. Rural Australia already pays over the odds for food, clothes and everyday purchases. The coalition wants to slug them and their kids with this quality of life destroyer, this 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of women in rural Australia? I know this will be of great interest to the shadow Minister, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey). While the Government is putting through a Bill to protect women consumers, the coalition intends pushing women back into the bad old days when they were third class citizens. A GST would tax women as they spend, and lower income earners and single mothers would be the hardest hit. The coalition's spending cuts would be disastrous for rural women. Child-care would become the domain of the wealthy. Most of the programs to assist rural women would be slashed, including women's health programs, affirmative action and funding for Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's industrial relations policy, as the shadow Minister well knows, basically would take women out of the work force or, alternatively, have them working in slave-like conditions. In New Zealand, women and young workers are suffering significant pay cuts&mdash;up to 30 per cent under the crazy deregulated labour market scam. Women would not have unions or tribunals to protect them. This would be a horrendous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we legislate to protect women as consumers&mdash;that is what this Bill is all about&mdash;the Opposition plans, firstly, to drive them out of the work force and, secondly, to scare the wits out of them in their homes by using such ridiculous and abominable scare tactics as the brochure that is circulating throughout this country. While we get on with the business of governing, I believe the coalition's GST is not much more than monkey business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support this Bill before the House. I note that the coalition also supports it. However, some of the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General ought be treated with the contempt they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly will be debating it but, as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) leaves this chamber, I would like to clarify three points that he raised in his speech. Firstly, instead of taking cheap shots at the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in relation to the formulation process for this piece of legislation, he should be thanking the honourable member for his vigilance in following through the development of this legislation. Secondly, as for attacking the coalition on its lack of consultation, it was only because of the vigilance of the honourable member for Higgins that we actually had a consultation process put in place with this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, by attacking the coalition's GST, which we know is the tool that is going to enable us to reform the system and to provide the protection for women in particular that the honourable member for Kennedy seemed so concerned about, it actually will protect and create jobs for women. In fact, it was the principal economic adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who said that the compensation package provided under the Fightback plan was more than sufficient to compensate women and everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention to the debate that we are meant to be having this morning. I want to place on the formal record a tribute to the work done by the shadow Attorney-General in getting this Bill into an acceptable form. It has taken over a year to convince the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that the original legislation was totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation which was put forward by the Minister last year was totally unacceptable to the Opposition and all reasonable and fair minded people. That legislation, through not setting a limit on manufacturers' liability and reversing the onus of proof from claimant to defendant, would have made Australia a risk zone for manufacturers, thus discouraging manufacturing in Australia. At the time the Minister put forward the legislation, the Business Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this was a fundamental departure from a basic principle of law and will have serious consequences in terms of increased litigation and escalating insurance premiums, higher research and development costs, an increase in prices of consumer goods and reduced competitiveness of Australian products on the international market.</PARA>
<PARA>Added to these disadvantages, Australian manufacturers would have been vulnerable to litigation from overseas buyers. At long last, commonsense and better policy have prevailed in this instance and the legislation that we have here today is, thanks to the work of the shadow Attorney-General, evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987 several national bodies have officially advocated a revision of product liability legislation in Australia. The National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council recommended changes and the Australian Law Reform Commission subsequently proposed a new legal framework to resolve cases of product liability. It is, however, interesting to point out that neither the Law Reform Commission nor the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council was able to provide evidence of the extent to which current product liability law was inefficient or unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission's 1987 survey of 8,600 consumers, which provided information on the number of people suffering product related injuries or illnesses, showed that the great majority of consumers, given the existing legislative framework, were able to resolve the majority of their problems. The system that the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended in 1989 was a system of strict liability, subject to defences which would have dramatically shifted the allocation of loss to manufacturers. Its proposal would have had serious and adverse consequences, as the Industry Commission report, which was asked to examine the economic effect of its proposal, found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's report, which was released in July 1990, stated that Australia's export competitiveness would be adversely affected by its proposals and that adopting its proposals would reduce product innovation and availability in Australia. The report found that the ALRC's proposals would lead to a rise in total product liability, insurance costs and producers' costs, and product prices would rise. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated that product liability claims would have increased from $213m to $724m if the ALRC's proposals were implemented. The report also found that most goods would incur small price increases, although the price of some hazardous goods could increase significantly. The report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . given the longer term efficiency costs, the adjustment costs that a new legal regime would entail, and the evidence that the benefits would be small, the Commission judges that the ALRC's proposals would reduce economic efficiency. The Commission considers that the ALRC's proposals should not be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>Given these findings, the coalition welcomed the Government's decision in March 1991 that it would not accept the ALRC's proposals. The coalition recognised that there was a need for a balance to be struck between the right of consumers to recover damages for injury suffered as a result of defective products and the need to ensure that any proposal adopted did not unnecessarily and adversely affect manufacturers and act as a disincentive to manufacturing investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 May 1991 the Government announced that it would amend the Trade Practices Act to introduce new laws concerning product liability&mdash;its so-called compromise position. Under that proposal, manufacturers would be liable for defects, but the onus of proof was to be imposed on the manufacturer; that is, the onus of proof was to be reversed. In other words, products causing loss would be assumed defective unless proven otherwise. In this way, all manufacturers in court actions would have been assumed to have manufactured defective products unless they could have proved otherwise. This amendment was contrary to the common law which has required that `he who asserts must prove'. The coalition firmly believes that the onus of proof should be left with the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs at the time, Senator Tate, on speaking about this proposal, claimed that the legislation was following the lead of the EC. However, on examination there were substantial differences. The EC directive of 25 July 1985 is an attempt to allocate loss arising in countries which are members of the European Community and was different from the one proposed by Senator Tate. Article 4 of the directive states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the injured person shall be required to prove the damage, the defect and the cause or relationship between defect and damage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the onus of proving a product is defective under the directive is on the claimant. The Government's original decision to place the burden of proof onto the manufacturers to prove that the product was not defective created well-founded fears within the Australian business community that the reversal of the onus of proof, coupled with a liability standard based on safety which the community can reasonably expect, would expose local manufacturers and importers to the type and quantity of design claims litigated in the United States over the past several decades. For example, the Chief Executive of Health Casualty and General Pty Ltd, Mr Waites, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the question must be asked as to why we should be introducing legislation which in the opinion of the insurance industry will give rise and access to more claims generation and consequent increases in litigation with a natural progression of escalating costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Ellen Beerworth, a lawyer from Malleson Stephen Jacques in Sydney, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the reversal is likely to affect the number of claims as well as the claims negotiation process, possibly leading to higher settlements.</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Council of Australia strongly opposed the Government's proposal. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian business strongly agrees with the Industry Commission that in view of the problems likely to arise as a result of reversing the onus of proof, the Government should adopt the European directive without modification.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has always supported the approach of the EC directive and, at the same time, consistently expressed concern about proposals to alter onus of proof. Compared with Australia's current laws, the EC directive allows a claimant to establish relatively easily that a product that has caused loss is defective. This alone will improve access to a legal remedy for consumers of faulty products without imposing the onus of proof on manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, Senator Tate announced that the Bill would be redrafted and that he would not pursue his proposal to reverse the burden of proof. He would, therefore, keep legislation consistent with common law by putting the onus of proof on the claimant. However, a provision clause, 75AJ, was included in November 1991. This clause would have operated to discharge the claimant's burden of proving that the product was defective where the circumstances of an injury allowed a reasonable inference to be drawn that the defect existed. As Senator Tate said in commenting on the new Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where all the circumstances of an injury point to a defect in the product causing the damage, then that inference should be drawn.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition was not satisfied with that proposal because it still imposed an unnecessary burden on manufacturers and because it was still not in line with the EC directive. On 27 April 1992, Senator Tate announced that he intended tabling in Federal Parliament that week a revised product liability Bill designed to ensure a fair go for both consumers and industry. He said he was confident that the new legislation would strike a fair balance. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consumers will now have ready access to compensation when they are injured by a defective product. Manufacturers, on the other hand, can rest assured that they will only be liable when a product they have supplied has been shown to be defective.</PARA>
<PARA>He later announced that the controversial clause 75AJ would be replaced by a new clause 75AL. This new clause purported to restrict the drawing of inferences from evidence to those cases in which the defendant seeks to have an action stayed or dismissed. However, business groups, including the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, viewed that clause as representing little if any improvement over its predecessor, clause 75AJ. They saw it as a second attempt by Senator Tate to include an inference provision in the reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 75AL clause was unsatisfactory because it was uncertain and unclear in its application for both manufacturers and consumers; there was a major discrepancy between the likely application of the provision and the intention of the inference as stated in the explanatory memorandum; there was confusion as to whether a court was being asked to draw inferences at the interlocutory stage, at the conclusion of the claimant's case or at the time of final determination of the action; and it remained possible for inferences based other than on admissible evidence to form the basis of a successful claimant's case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the revised Bill, which Senator Tate intended releasing at the end of the April 1992, contained no real concession to business interests in terms of defences or the statute of repose for personal injury. The Bill also proposed that the statute of repose be extended to 20 years after the date upon which the product was put on the market in respect of claims for personal injury. The extension of the statute of repose in personal injury claims would have impacted most upon the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, where the injuries which allegedly result from exposure or consumption may take a lengthy period in which to become manifest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition could not support this proposal either, because we believe that if the law in Australia is to match that under the EC directive then the onus of proof should be on the claimant. The coalition concerns about this proposal were echoed by members of the Caucus legal and administrative affairs committee. They criticised the Minister because they believed that the product liability legislation would make Australian industry uncompetitive internationally. As a result, on 6 May 1992 Labor Caucus forced the Government to remove the highly contentious clause 75AL. Caucus also rejected the extraterritorial provisions, the clause which would have let consumers from all over the world take action against an Australian manufacturer whose exported good may have caused injury or harm. These changes left the legislation substantially different from that which Senator Tate had originally proposed back in May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is now in a form which is acceptable to the Opposition; but it is only in this form, contrary to what the honourable member for Kennedy said, because the shadow Attorney-General has been forcing the Government at every stage. In fact, the three contentious areas of the legislation&mdash;those being onus of proof, statute of repose and extraterritorial arrangements&mdash;were all resolved according to what we in the Opposition had been arguing for and, as I have said, the shadow Attorney-General in particular, since the inception of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that result, the onus of proof is now on the claimant, in line with the EC directive; the statute of repose for death or injury is set at 10 years from the date of that death or injury; and the extraterritorial arrangements have been removed so that the legislation is limited to loss or damage suffered within Australia. I do not believe that an examination by a Senate committee of the three aspects that have been removed from the Bill as suggested by the Minister is warranted, particularly given that the Caucus has already expressed its view and it will not accept those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends the Trade Practices Act by introducing a new part VA to cover manufacturers' liability for defective products. Essentially, the Bill proposes to introduce product liability along the lines set out in the European Community Council directives of 25 July 1985. The provisions will be in addition to the existing statutory rights and common law. Basically, the Bill imposes a regime of strict liability. A person who is injured or dies or who suffers property damage as a result of a defective product has a right to compensation against the manufacturer. The shadow Attorney-General has previously outlined the coalition's stance in relation to this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I point out that this legislation does not rule other laws in this area void. Under section 75AR, the operation of other laws and remedies is preserved. People will still have rights under existing contract, tort and statutory law. This means, of course, that manufacturers can be sued under a number of different laws&mdash;contract, breach of contract, tort, negligence, and statutory law such as the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the entire period of discussion of the issue of product liability and the amendment to the Trade Practices Act, the Opposition has agreed with the Government's basic approach that Australian consumers who are injured by defective goods should be placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed by their European counterparts in the same situation. In fact, the coalition believes there is good sense in harmonising product liability in Australia with the EC directive which is likely to become, de facto, the international standard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment Bill is the culmination of the Government's efforts to reform and change product liability law in Australia. As my colleague the shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), who has just spoken, said, it has had a long gestation period. These efforts began in 1987, when the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council produced a report into consumer product safety which argued for the introduction of a new comprehensive product liability law that imposed strict liability on producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government subsequently asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to investigate the adequacy of Australia's product liability laws, with the Commission eventually handing down its report in 1989. The Australian Law Reform Commission report into product liability was the subject of much controversy, and the Government has been trying to formulate and refine its product liability proposals ever since. The Government's stated intentions in this matter have changed on numerous occasions at the behest of either the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, or the Labor Caucus legal and administrative affairs committee. The latter rolled the Minister with regard to product liability on at least one occasion, as the honourable member for McEwen has already indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Minister was forced to withdraw provisions that would have assigned to manufacturers the onus of proof in product liability cases, in a way that was totally contrary to common law practice and principles. Common law requires that he who asserts must prove, which means that the onus of proof in product liability cases should rest squarely with the user of the goods concerned. Apparently, the Minister was prepared to entertain all manner of contortions on the question of onus of proof in this legislation in a vain attempt to satisfy the self-appointed consumer movement which has been the principal impetus behind the introduction of product liability legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these contortions works because they all offend the profound commonsense of the common law approach in these matters. Thus, we are largely back to where we started with this legislation. We have spent five years and untold expense in coming to the realisation that the existing common law approach is the best, something that many people maintained from the outset of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us is actually a second draft of legislation first introduced last year, known as the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which languished in the Senate for most of 1991 until finally being discharged from the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> only a few weeks ago to make way for this new Bill. It was claimed&mdash;perhaps in hindsight&mdash;that the former Bill was a public exposure draft and it solicited much commentary from interested parties. However, as a result of the consultative process which was established, the Government's proposals have undergone several changes over recent months and weeks. Generally, they are to be welcomed. This has led to an entirely new Bill to take account of the Government's latest proposals which represent a significant departure from the Government's initial proposals on product liability law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of this new Bill, as I have said, is welcomed, given that much confusion&mdash;perhaps great confusion&mdash;could have resulted from an attempt to graft the new measures onto the old by way of government amendments. This new Bill should, thus, serve the Government's intentions much better than an amended version of the old Bill, especially since these intentions have now changed quite radically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Bill provides that a manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Goods are said to be defective when they do not provide the degree of safety that people are entitled to expect, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Claimants will no longer need to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer of goods in order to be able to claim compensation for loss caused by defects in those goods. The claimant need only prove that on the balance of probabilities the product was defective and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes available a number of defences to manufacturers of goods in product liability cases. A state of the art defence will apply whereby manufacturers will not be held liable for defects, the existence of which was incapable of being ascertained by any means or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers will also not be liable for losses if the product was defective because it was complying with a mandatory government standard. Where the standard is imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for any loss. Furthermore, compensation can be reduced or disallowed to take into account any acts of the claimant that contributed to the loss, and that is as it should be. The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of consumers who have a product liability claim and who have given their prior written consent to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals represent a major improvement on those advocated by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1989 report. The ALRC's proposals required that claimants need only to show that the loss resulted from `the way the goods acted' in order to establish liability. If adopted there would have been no requirement to establish that the goods were defective or that the producer was negligent or had breached some statutory duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Industry Commission noted in its examination of the ALRC's report, this version of product liability would effectively establish a presumption of producer liability. The claimant would have needed to show only that the loss was suffered while using the product in order for the producer to be held liable&mdash;something that is not commonly in dispute. The onus would have been on the producer to prove an alternative cause of loss or to successfully invoke one of the available defences, or to show that the loss was the result of some unreasonable use of the good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission found against the ALRC's proposals, noting that while there were defects in the existing law the ALRC's proposals would reduce overall economic efficiency since they did not allocate liability in an optimal fashion and would impose major costs on the economy. At the same time, it has been recognised that the existing law dealing with product liability is deficient in a number of ways. There is a lack of single product liability law, with a number of overlapping laws making up the existing legal bases for product liability&mdash;a situation which is further complicated by differences in State and Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers can already be sued under the laws of contract or of tort, or under provision 2A of part V of the Trade Practices Act. Under current laws, consumers suffering product related loss are entitled to compensation if they can establish a breach of contract, a breach of duty of care, or a breach of statutory product standard. A number of deficiencies arise in this regard. First, not all losses caused by defective products are compensated under these existing laws. As a result, liabilities for some losses that should fall upon producers often fall upon consumers or bystanders, and this creates the wrong incentives for producers to exercise appropriate care. On the other hand, actions for breach of contract in product liability cases fail to make provision for improper use of products by consumers which contributes to their subsequent loss, with subsequent liability falling inappropriately on producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Industry Commission noted in its report, an efficient product liability regime would see producers generally liable for losses caused by their products, while consumers would be liable for losses caused by the misuse of products, including some circumstances where losses suffered are from risks associated with the characteristics of those products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this is the ideal, it is not an ideal that is easy to realise in law. There are numerous grey areas involved in establishing the cause of loss in any given case. In devising a product liability regime, it is necessary to make the greatest possible allowance for these grey areas to minimise any potential inequities that may emerge under that regime. The Industry Commission concluded that only a few relatively minor amendments were necessary to the current laws in order to establish a product liability regime that would be more efficient than both the current laws and the ALRC's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was also the conclusion of Professor Richard Epstein, from the University of Chicago, who addressed the then proposed product liability law changes during a visit to Australia a couple of years ago. Epstein, it should be noted, is an eminent scholar in the economic analysis of the law. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best reform that Australia and New Zealand could make in product liability law is to keep with the status quo: let there be liability for latent defects that cause harm in ordinary use, and leave the rest to the market. You can learn from the American experience only if you recognise the massive errors in judgement that have spurred on our judicial innovations of the last generation.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he is talking about the American experience there. The American experience with product liability law has been disastrous&mdash;a fact that is widely recognised, with the possible exception of the members of the Australian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Huber, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Liability: the Legal Revolution and its Consequences</EMPHASIS>, had this to say about the impact of product liability laws in the United States:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one of the most ubiquitous taxes we pay, now levied on virtually everything we buy, sell and use. The tax accounts for 30% of the price of a stepladder and over 95% of the price of childhood vaccines. It is responsible for one-quarter of the price of a ride on a Long Island tour bus and one-third of the price of a small airplane. It will soon cost large municipalities as much as they spend on fire and sanitation services.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one appraisal of the effect of product liability laws as they have developed in the United States. United States product liability law has been a disaster because it treats consumers like idiots who are incapable of seeking out and acting upon the information available on any given product and incapable of modifying their behaviour in the light of changing circumstances. As Professor Epstein said, describing the situation in the United States:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No longer is it sufficient to provide a consumer with enough information about a product so that he could make his decision on whether or how to use the product, or indeed to inquire further before making that decision. Instead of seeking to supply information, the law now seeks to govern production, but always after the fact and in a standardless way. In its former role, the law aided the operation of the market by helping market actors make informed decisions. In its modern incarnation the law has powerful anti-market origins and consequences. The rules are designed to override consumer preferences and to allow judges and juries to assume the role of design and warning experts . . . The American economy now operates with a permanent limp because of the mistaken liability rules in the product area.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the state of affairs the Australian Law Reform Commission and the likes of the self-appointed Australian Consumers Association would have foisted upon us if they had their way. Fortunately, we have in Australia bodies such as the Industry Commission and other authorities to expose such proposals to critical scrutiny and to reveal just how much they could cost the Australian economy were they to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this Bill now contains little by way of the Australian Law Reform Commission's original proposals is partly due to the work of the Industry Commission, which only highlights the importance of that body retaining its present role and not being nobbled by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), as will happen with his proposed changes to that body. The Trade Practices Amendment Bill as it now stands is relatively harmless. Indeed, the Australian Consumers Association has attacked the legislation as being as weak as water, which is perhaps the best possible endorsement this legislation could have been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is additional to, and does not compromise, existing common law rights and relevant statute law. The Bill seeks to imitate the European Community's product liability directive of 1985, which has now become the internationally recognised standard for product liability law. This it now does, following the Government's back-down on the various questions of onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also desirable that Australian laws on product liability be in harmony with those of our trading partners, which this Bill will now largely achieve. The Bill now has the support of the Australian business community, which is in sharp contrast to the vehement opposition the Government's initial proposals encountered from that quarter. The challenge now will be to keep the Government's product liability laws limited to the provisions contained in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, has warned that this is not the last word from the Government on the subject. The Government will certainly be under pressure from the Australian Consumers Association to introduce new product liability laws&mdash;in return, I suppose, for the aid and comfort that that body invariably provides for Labor governments. These provisions could include so-called `Aussie battler' provisions designed to guarantee consumers their day in court and provisions to make Australian manufacturers responsible to overseas consumers for defective products. The coalition will continue to be alert to developments in this area to ensure that the ALRC's proposals, or similar propositions, do not raise their ugly heads in Australia once again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will add a few brief words to this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill. The legislation, as my colleagues have said, is generally welcomed by the Opposition. Within it there is the standardisation of product liability with the regime based on the 1985 European Community product liability directive and, as such, it provides an advantage in the parallel application of product liability to the requirements within the European Community. I think that is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key concept is that a person who is injured or whose property is damaged by a defective product will have a right to compensation against the manufacturer of the product. The amount of compensation is subject to a number of defences. I will not repeat the words of my colleagues who have gone through the detail of the Bill, but I do have a few worries with the legislation which I will identify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, whilst I understand the process by which it has been developed and the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am disappointed in a couple of aspects of the legislation. I am worried about the extent to which `Commonwealth mandatory standard' is defined as a mandatory standard imposed by Commonwealth law. As the explanatory memorandum notes, a standard developed by a Commonwealth authority but imposed under State or Territory laws is not a Commonwealth mandatory standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my real worries is that there should be in product liability the same application of responsibility to imported products as there is to domestic products. Under the terms of the legislation, that will be so because an unidentified manufacturer, under the new section 75AJ(1), includes a person who is a supplier of the actioned goods who is known to the person. That means that if the manufacturer of the goods cannot be identified&mdash;that is, a person having been requested to identify the manufacturer and the manufacturer being outside jurisdiction&mdash;then the supplier who is the importer can be made liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imported foodstuffs, however, because the standards are imposed through a Commonwealth authority and not under State and Territory laws, apparently will be exempt. I think that is regrettable. One of the real problems we have at this time in the rural sector is the range of imported products, particularly processed products, which are not produced to the same standard as those produced domestically. For instance, I am told that at the moment the Government is considering a proposal to allow imports of broiler chickens from Thailand. While, for health reasons, I find that almost unbelievable, what worries me is that the broiler industry in Australia has developed a series of practices designed to ensure not only the quality of the product but that the quality of the product meets the customers' requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand section 9 from the notes on clauses in the explanatory memorandum, those broilers, if they are permitted to be imported from Thailand, will not be subject to this sort of a trade practice amendment liability. I think that is regrettable because, from my perspective, packaging and labelling of foodstuffs are matters which have long needed, if not regimentation, at least identification on a common basis, whether they are produced or manufactured in Australia or whether they are imported. To the degree to which in the definition, as I read it, there is to be a differentiation between those standards that are imposed by a Commonwealth authority and those that are imposed by a Commonwealth law, I think it is regrettable that this legislation does not go further than it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I note that the Australian Consumers Association, for example, wants the legislation to go much further, I do not go along with its concerns. I think that what has been produced is going to impose a significant discipline on manufacturers and importers in other fields. Therefore, I accept that not only is this a worthwhile amendment to the Trade Practices Bill but also its extension is going to ensure that there is a reasonable duty of care. It has moved a long way from the old legal maxim of caveat emptor. But my first area of concern is that there is a problem with imported foodstuffs, and I am disappointed that they apparently are excluded from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second area of concern is with respect to the defences. I have read the proposed section 75AK, which sets down the defences. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the defect in the action goods that is alleged to have caused the loss did not exist at the supply time; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) they had that defect only because there was compliance with a mandatory standard for them; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time when they were supplied by their actual manufacturer was not such as to enable that defect to be discovered; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) if they were comprised in other goods (`<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">finished goods</EMPHASIS>')&mdash;that defect is attributable only to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the design of the finished goods; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) the markings on or accompanying the finished goods; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) the instructions or warnings given by the manufacturer of the finished goods.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems that I have is that, at this time, most manufacturers, if they identify a defect, are able to recall the product by advertising. It may well be that under the principal Act advertising of a defect is going to continue as being a reasonable defence. But there has to be a capacity for a manufacturer or an importer, having identified the defect, to say, `Look, there is a failure in this particular component'. If the defect is in a motor vehicle&mdash;for example, in the engine, brakes, exhaust manifold or whatever it happens to be&mdash;the manufacturers should be reasonably able, by significant advertisement of the defect, a product recall, and perhaps even writing to each of those whose addresses and identities are available to the retailers, to try to get back those articles that have been distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have had any number of instances where, for one reason or another, there has been a defect and, the defect having been identified, the manufacturers seek to recall the  product. I suggest that there is a problem because this amendment does not identify such  action as a specific defence. I believe that it should be a defence, and I think that it would not be unreasonable for it to be in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern is the time for commencing actions. Proposed section 75AO(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at any time within three years after the time the person became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the alleged loss, the defect and the identity of the person who manufactured the action goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed section 75AO(2) states that action must be commenced within 10 years of the supply. I am interested in those years. I think that it would be better if the statutory seven years were preserved. The trouble is that we have so many different years applying to different products that it becomes a bit confusing as to just what time applies to what and where. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand that that is undoubtedly a product of the derivation of this legislation from the European Community product liability directive, I think it is unfortunate that we have different standards at different times, which makes it difficult for people to identify and recall just what applies in a particular instance. I say that because inevitably, even though this legislation is now going through&mdash;and presumably there will be some attempt to advertise its provisions&mdash;I do not doubt that people will forget the particular provisions of time within this legislation. I prefer that we standardise on the statute of limitations; that we make a common time. Seven years has been the period in the legislation. Seven years is common in other fields of the law and, as far as I am concerned, it would be better for seven years to be in this field of the law. I know it varies in other jurisdictions&mdash;in the tax Act, for example. But if we are going to have variations all we have to do is to try to identify how long and where. I think it is unfortunate when we have a variance to that degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that there is a class of goods which can be conveniently referred to&mdash;and I refer to paragraph 22 of the explanatory memorandum&mdash;as `inherently dangerous products'. Inevitably, as the explanatory memorandum notes, there is a degree of risk in the use of those products. I think that there has to be a responsibility of care by the user. I notice that there is reference to the fact that if people have, by their own malfeasance or their own use of the product, contributed to the damage suffered then that either mitigates the liability or absolves the manufacturer or importer of that liability. That is essential because it seems to me that that is one of the difficulties in determining the nature and quality of goods&mdash;to identify those goods which require a greater standard of care than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern that I have is that our industrial laws at the moment do not really allow a common standard of product excellence. Australians have an enormous technical and physical capability, as they have a technological capacity, to design and produce to the standards set anywhere in the world. Our difficulty is&mdash;and it has long been said&mdash;that, if we buy a car assembled on a Monday or Friday, we are likely to find that the quality of that product is not of the same degree as those assembled on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. I do not suggest that within the trade practices legislation there should be a right of action against individuals. But out of this legislation I trust that standards of care and of excellence within manufacturing plants can be set up to ensure that we avoid that unfortunate contrast between the so-called lower standard of Australian products and the standard of those imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, it is in everybody's interest that the quality of our goods should be of the highest possible standard. In shipbuilding, for example, I am quite conscious that it is often said that our ships are overdesigned and too well built. There is a major problem if we do not ensure that the quality of workmanship for every product delivered from whatever factory or outlet is of a uniformly high standard. Whether or not that can be achieved by legislative writ is another question. But, for my money, that is one of the principal areas of concern in Australia's competitiveness. It is induced by industrial relations policy and by work practices that have grown in many fields of endeavour in this country. But it is a field which needs to be considered very carefully, for the repercussions of that variation in product quality is something that certainly prejudices the reputation of many Australian products. That having been said, perhaps this legislation will be a step towards improving that excellence and, as a result, it may contribute to making our goods more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, I welcome this legislation, but I draw the attention of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) to the particular concerns that I have raised. Firstly, the problem with foodstuffs and, significantly, the fact that we are eating many imported processed foods at the moment that do not meet the labelling standards required. Because the standards are set by a Commonwealth authority, they are apparently going to be outside this legislation. I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and in particular, I drew attention to the defences&mdash;the fact that there needs to be a capacity for a person who has advertised the defect and sought product withdrawal to have that as mitigating damages. I suggest that there should be reference in the legislation to that so that it is a permissible defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I regret that we are setting two new periods within the legislation which differ from those that have existed in other fields. I think that just adds to confusion. As we seek product liability through this legislation, it seems to me that is one field where the product liability of what we are producing, which is an Act of the Parliament, should try to meet those same standards: a uniform time, an understandable time, and one that people in the community can be reasonably expected to both remember and comprehend and ultimately, of course, with which they should comply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all honourable members for participating in the debate on what is unquestionably landmark legislation. Honourable members will be aware that the principal carriage of this matter over the last two years has been with Senator Tate in his former capacity as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I do not intend to detain the passage of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill any further by engaging in a prolonged discussion of the very many matters of detail involved in the subject of product liability reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are quite a few things I do want to mention. Most of the matters of detail, including many of the issues raised by the Opposition spokesperson, the shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), have been dealt with in a very comprehensive way by Senator Tate in the course of his very extensive consultations about this legislation and in his remarks made in the other place when that chamber considered the Bill on 3 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that, after having had a good look at what he has said in his speech, I would like to reply personally to some of the matters he has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my own part, as the new Minister for Consumer Affairs I take this opportunity to express my personal pleasure in being the Minister at the despatch box when this long awaited reform is going to be put into law at last. Make no mistake, this is an important reform which will very considerably advance the rights of those Australians who suffer bodily injury or some loss in relation to their property occasioned by a product being put into the community which does not meet the standard of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect. If a manufacturer does not design the product correctly, does not have adequate quality control processes during the manufacturing stage, or does not provide adequate information or warnings as it goes into the marketplace, then it is right and proper that that manufacturer should bear the financial consequences if it causes injury or damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill ensures that that eminently reasonable and fair approach to manufacturers' liabilities should become the law in this country. In so doing, this Parliament will also ensure that Australian manufacturing practices are brought right up to the prevailing international standard. Whether exporting their products to the many countries with a similar legal standard&mdash;and that is a group which is likely soon to include many of our major regional trading partners, such as Japan and South Korea&mdash;or producing solely for the domestic market, the fact is that producers will all benefit from the consistency of manufacturing standards which this law will bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I also understand the concern of some that certain matters originally proposed by Senator Tate have been deleted from the Bill as it presently stands. As I indicated in my second reading speech, those matters, which I regard as of considerable importance, are to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I think they are important questions which need to be ventilated fully in the public arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee inquiry, which has been proposed, will provide the opportunity for manufacturer and consumer lobby groups to put forward their views in a way which is not hidden, not by way of the sort of lobbying and whisper campaigns that we see around the corridors on this sort of thing, but open and on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record so that these matters can be properly assessed by the senators on that committee. I am sure they will come forward with some very constructive suggestions about these important questions. For my own part, I look forward to receiving that report and taking up the challenge this important reform process presents to us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters which I want to refer to. First of all, honourable members may be aware that, when this Bill was before the other place on 3 June, the Opposition made the claim that, despite undertakings by this Government that the provision which was to have allowed overseas consumers to take action under this regime had been removed from the Bill, the proposed amendment to section 6 of the Trade Practices Act included in the Bill would have that effect. That claim was based on a letter from the law firm Clayton Utz which apparently received confirmation of this opinion by Mr R. J. Ellicott, QC. On the basis of this opinion, the Opposition sought to have the proposed amendment to section 6 of the Trade Practices Act removed from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, Senator Tate told the Senate that his advice was that the conclusion by Clayton Utz and Mr Ellicott, QC, was incorrect. He also undertook to seek definitive legal advice from the Chief General Counsel of the Commonwealth, Mr Dennis Rose, QC, as a matter of urgency and to amend the Bill should Mr Rose agree with Mr Ellicott's conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now received the advice from Mr Rose, who, I should mention, has an enviable reputation as an eminent constitutional lawyer. He has concluded that the proposed amendment to section 6 will not have the extraterritorial effect claimed by the Opposition. This advice confirms that the Bill, as it is now before the House, does reflect the Government's intention, as stated in Senator Tate's second reading speech in the Senate, and will not have the effect of allowing consumers in overseas countries who purchase Australian made goods to take action against Australian manufacturers in Australian courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wondered whether I should proceed in asking for it to be incorporated, but the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) does not want that, so I would love to read it. The letter is from the Chief General Counsel in Canberra and is to the Attorney-General's Department. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your request for urgent advice on the question whether the provisions proposed to be inserted in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (`the Act') by the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 (`the Bill') would have extra-territorial operation in the sense of conferring on persons outside Australia a right to sue in Australian courts for injuries or losses suffered by reason of defects in goods manufactured in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. I have been provided with a copy of an Opinion by Mr R.J. Ellicott QC in which he concludes that there is a `strong argument' for the view that the Bill in its present form would give the proposed Part VA an extra-territorial effect of that kind `in relation to contracts made or the supply of goods in the course of overseas trade and commerce'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. I respectfully disagree with that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Mr Ellicott argues that, but for section 5, the provisions of the Act that `on their face apply to the conduct of corporations and persons anywhere in the world would probably have been read down to relate to conduct within Australia'. On the other hand, he argues, the provisions relating to trade and commerce with other countries (including s.6(2), which gives various provisions an operation to trade and commerce with places outside Australia) `need no reading down'. It appears that his reason for drawing this distinction is that a provision relating to overseas trade or commerce is a provision that `relates to a clear subject of legislative power', thus implying that provisions dealing with extra-territorial conduct without limitation exceed the Commonwealth's legislative powers and therefore need to be read down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first difficulty with that argument is that it seems clearly inconsistent with the decision of the High Court in Polyukhovich v. The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501, which establishes that (subject to constitutional limitations not relevant here) the Commonwealth's external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the Constitution extends to laws dealing with conduct of any kind outside Australia (whether or not it is related to overseas trade or other subjects of Commonwealth legislative powers such as defence). Secondly, I see no reason in principle why a provision relating to overseas trade should be regarded as exempt from the general presumption that legislation is limited to conduct and things within the enacting jurisdiction (see also the statutory version of this presumption in section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901; also, on a related presumption, I note Meyer Heine Pty Ltd v. The China Navigation Co Ltd (1966) 115 CLR 10).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, other arguments for the view that Part VA would have some extra-territorial effects in the sense relevant here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, first take the proposed section 75AD read without the alternative effects given by section 6(2). It should, in my opinion, be construed in accordance with the general presumption mentioned above and with the natural inference that can be drawn from the fact that section 5 contains no reference to part VA. On that basis I think that paragraph (a) of section 75AD would probably be limited to the `supply' of goods by a corporation in Australia, including `supply' here by way of export. As read in accordance with section 6(2)(c), I think that section 75AD would similarly be construed as limited to `supply' within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is by no means entirely clear that section 75AD(c) would be limited to cases where the relevant injury was suffered in Australia. (In relation to the interpretative presumption referred to above, it has been said judicially that `not every aspect of every sentence or clause of legislation . . . must be given the local connotation':</PARA>
<PARA>References follow. The advice continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In resolving these questions, I think that section 75AI is important. That provision would prevent double recovery where, for instance, an amount had been recovered under a Commonwealth, State or Territory workers' compensation law. If, for example, section 75AD had been intended to apply where the relevant injury had been suffered outside Australia, I think that double recovery under a foreign workers' compensation law would also have been precluded. It is true that such double recovery is not precluded in the case of a foreign worker in Australia who suffers injury in circumstances occurring wholly within Australia. However, I do not think that this limited anomaly is sufficient to preclude an inference from section 75AI that the main provisions (sections 75AD to 75AG inclusive) were intended to apply only to injury, loss, destruction or damage occurring in Australia. In my opinion, those provisions would be construed by the courts as limited in that way. Parliamentary references to `Australian consumers' (Senate Hansard, 3 June 1992) support this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Dennis Rose QC)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief General Counsel</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer to two other matters. First, as currently proposed, the new product liability regime will come into operation when this Act receives royal assent. This is likely to occur early in July. This means that consumers will have rights under the regime against the manufacture of any defective goods which are supplied by the manufacturer after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached by the Opposition spokesperson on consumer affairs who has asked that a longer period be allowed before manufacturers become subject to that regime. The Government simply cannot agree to this request. The Bill to implement this proposal that we are dealing with today was first introduced by the Government in the Senate in December last year. At that time Senator Tate encouraged all interested parties to comment on any matter in the Bill which was of particular concern to them. I am informed by Senator Tate that he is not aware of any submission about that Bill making any comment on the proposal that the legislation come into force on royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Government first announced its intention to introduce a strict product liability regime based on the EC directive over 12 months ago. Manufacturers have long been aware that this Government intended to act to ensure that consumers are justly treated by the legal system. It would be an abrogation of the Government's responsibility to injured consumers to sanction any further delay in the introduction of this regime. Manufacturers who supply defective goods to Australian consumers must be required by the Parliament properly to assume responsibility for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter is the following:  when this Bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, that Committee raised a question about the effect of a particular provision of the Bill on the operation of the rest of the Trade Practices Act. If passed by the Parliament, the provision would have the effect of providing that State and Territory laws about the survival of the right to take legal action after the actual claimant has died will apply to actions taken under the new regime. These laws provide that certain rights of action can be taken up by the estate of a deceased claimant. This is an important aspect of the proposed liability regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee has asked whether, because the Bill expressly includes this right of action, it negates, by implication, this right in relation to the rest of the Trade Practices Act. This matter is under consideration by the Government at the present time. As Senator Tate has already stated, it is certainly not the Government's intention to disturb any existing provision or rule of interpretation which would allow these State and Territory laws to apply to this or any other part of the Trade Practices Act aside from the insertion of this particular provision. I note the comment of the honourable senators, conscious of the fact that the views I express on behalf of the Government can be taken into account by the courts when interpreting this legislation. In the event that the Government agrees with the views raised by the Committee, I am happy to confirm that appropriate remedial action will be taken in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that, despite all the other matters I have just raised, we should not lose sight of the significance of this moment and this legislation. A very substantial reform is going to take place here and now, one which all consumers should feel justly pleased is going through the Parliament. Our law is about to take a giant step forward. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to take up two issues. The first concerns section 75AD, as proposed in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, and the opinion given by Dennis Rose, the Chief General Counsel, that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) has read out. There has been an argument as to the extent to which this Bill introduces extraterritoriality; that is, the extent to which people who are injured outside the Australian jurisdiction could take advantage of this Bill to bring their suits inside the Australian jurisdiction. The matter was raised in the Senate by the Opposition on the basis of an opinion from Mr Ellicott and this opinion was obtained in response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very useful to get both opinions. The Minister has relied upon the opinion of Dennis Rose to say, effectively, that the Bill ought not be given extraterritorial effect. The first point is that it would be of some assistance if the Government would make it absolutely clear that it does not intend the Bill to have that effect. That would be of great assistance. We would prefer, of course, if it were clear in the legislative terms but, for the sake of the record, it might be of assistance if that were the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The learned shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas, who understands finer points like this, in fact, raises it with me. I do want to emphasise one point:  the opinion of Dennis Rose is not at all unequivocal. Paragraph 8 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is by no means entirely clear that section 75AD(c) would be limited to cases where the relevant injury was suffered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the opinion that the Government relies upon and it says, `it is by no means entirely clear'. Then Dennis Rose goes on to say that it would not have that effect because another section, section 75AI, which refers to workers compensation, refers only to workers compensation schemes in Australia and that, working back from that, there must be an intention to limit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going a long way around this by saying that the legislation is not to have extraterritorial effect. I for one would be very surprised if we ever saw a Bill in this place that said there could be no double claiming and that, for the purposes of Australian law, workers compensation under the statutes of Thailand, Taiwan or wherever had to be excluded. I think it is just as likely that nobody ever bothered to go into the complications and draw up the legislation that way. To work backwards and use that as a conclusion for saying that there is no extraterritorial effect is a long shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even after working backwards in that way, the Chief General Counsel reached the conclusion that the section was by no means entirely clear. The point we have made on this is that it ought to be clear. There is a public interest in making statutes as clear as possible. For the Government to come in here and say, `The point you raised is wrong because our opinion says it is by no means entirely clear' is hardly a defence. It is as much a damning of the legislation, admittedly in polite terms. It is a funny defence to say, `The provision does not have the effect you were concerned about because our opinion says that it is by no means entirely clear'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Government has set its sights on pushing the legislation through as quickly as possible. As I said earlier, and as the current shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), has indicated, the Opposition will not oppose it. However, if we are to go to a Senate committee&mdash;I have argued against a Senate committee all along because this matter has been gone through very carefully&mdash;and if it is the Government's intention that the legislation will not have any extraterritorial effect, the Government ought to move an amendment to that effect and make it clear in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wish to reply to is the pathetic display that was put on by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) in this debate. I am glad that the Minister stayed away from that. It has taken the honourable member since 4 June to work up his insults. When he did so they were pathetic. For a practically non-existent member of this House to stand up and throw around insults in that halting, hesitating, unintelligible, unintelligent and ignorant way was rather surprising. What he took great offence to&mdash;he did not really take offence; he was put up to saying so&mdash;was the point I made when the matter was before the House on 4 June 1992. I must have been the only person in Australia who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and saw that what the Minister had said in the Senate was not the right speech. If I had not raised the matter I do not think it would ever have been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> has now issued a weekly edition which contains a different speech from that which appeared in the daily edition of 26 May. The weekly edition bears the right speech; the daily edition bore the wrong speech. I raised the matter in this place on 4 June 1992, which was 10 days after the second reading speech was delivered. In those 10 days there had been no effort to correct the error, to explain it to us, and to apologise to us for allowing the wrong speech to be printed in the daily <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Presumably the Minister's staff read what the Minister has to say. Where were they? Even the new Minister did not pick it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must be the only person in Australia who spends time reading Ministers' second reading speeches. Nobody else seems to be at all interested. On this occasion it was worth reading it not for what it said but for what it did not say, because when I read it it did not amplify the meaning of the Bill at all; it related to another Bill. I am glad that this has been picked up. The Minister says that it is all the fault of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: he gave <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> one speech, which was withdrawn; he gave <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> another speech and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> printed the first speech and not the second speech. I illustrate this to show that there was confusion and speeches were going in and out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> like a rabbit goes in and out of a burrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting point is that the speech that was printed related to a Bill that was never even introduced into the Parliament. The Government acted as if this were a clean Bill, that it had never had any life before it appeared in this place on 4 June 1992. However, the wrong speech, which was put into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS>, related to a Bill that was never introduced. It was the third version that got killed even before it got into a House of this Parliament. That indicated the type of confusion that was going on. I am glad this has been corrected because, as I said before, it was going to be of no assistance to anyone to have the wrong speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. However, I should not have had to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Government to stand on its digs now and say that because Costello found it out that is somehow terrible&mdash;and to do so through some nobody from the north of Queensland saying that in the most pejorative and ignorant terms&mdash;is disgraceful.

For the Minister to say today that the industry has had a long period in which to become aware of what was to be contained in this legislation is not fair comment. The Minister would know as well as everyone else that over the past 12 months this legislation has seesawed backwards and forwards.

I urge the Minister to reconsider before the Bill reaches its final stages and to show the same degree of care and concern for this piece of legislation that was shown to a previous piece of legislation concerning the music industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the third occasion on which an Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill has come back to the House of Representatives in the last 15 months. One would hope that this will be the last occasion on which the Bill is presented, although with what is happening in the world of drugs in sport at the moment I am afraid that that may not necessarily be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has been reintroduced with what has been termed the Vinnicombe amendment following the difficulties that were experienced with Australian cyclist Martin Vinnicombe, who tested positive for anabolic steroids in the United States through tests carried out by Canadian authorities at the request of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Mr Vinnicombe subsequently avoided sanctions on a legal technicality, despite admitting to using the drugs. I congratulate the Government for moving so quickly to bring in those amendments and pay tribute to my colleague in the other place, Senator Michael Baume, who announced on 27 April this year that if the Government did not bring in these amendments the Opposition would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains a large number of amendments to make provision for a coordinated national approach through the States and Territories to eliminate drugs in sport following an agreement reached last year between the State and Territory sports Ministers and the Commonwealth. The Bill will also enable the agency to test a wider range of athletes, both in Australia and overseas, for the presence of prohibited drugs. The agency will be allowed to enter into contractual arrangements with overseas governments and other anti-doping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of the Bill will also enable it to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf, even if those procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard will be that provided for in the international Olympic charter against doping in sport. The agency will now be able to act on those results. Australian standards are currently stricter than those in the Olympic charter. In this respect, I think the Government and the Opposition are at one inasmuch as we are both dedicated to eradicating the scourge of drugs as best we can from the world of sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does have some protection for athletes who may be involved in such actions. It gives athletes the opportunity to make a challenge to the validity of a positive test result if procedures relating to the sealing of the container holding the sample or the testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory are not complied with or if there is evidence of tampering with the sample. Should the agency decide that the test is valid, the competitor will now be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. The agency must verify that all three above procedures were followed before validating a positive test result, even if there is no appeal by a competitor. Written notification to approved sporting and anti-doping organisations of a positive test result or of a refusal to provide the sample will now be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name of the register will be altered to the Register of Notifiable Events to remove any implication that the entry of a person's name on a register implies guilt. The question of guilt and application of sanctions will be the responsibility of the sporting organisations themselves. Some concern has been raised about the situation regarding minors&mdash;sports men and women under the age of 18&mdash;who may be caught up in the net. The Bill protects minors and makes allowance for the removal of a minor's name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by a sporting organisation has elapsed, provided that at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under the age of 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency will now have the power to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic charter and to request such bodies to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when the competitor is overseas. The agency will also be required to keep a list of such bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not oppose the Bill and, as I said a moment ago, obviously we are at one in trying to eliminate drugs from the sporting organisations. I think it would be fair to pay special tribute to those who because of their work are involved with the Sports Drug Agency and to give them any support we can. I believe the challenge they will be facing in the coming years will be most severe. It took sporting bodies about 40 years to start winning the battle against the use of anabolic steroids by elite athletes. If we looked back over that period and saw some of the things that were happening in sport, particularly in the old Iron Curtain countries such as East Germany, we would be horrified to know exactly what went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ben Johnson affair really brought the matter to public notice around the world. I think everyone was horrified at the time of the Seoul Olympics when his difficulties started. I pay tribute to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts for its investigation into drugs in sport. In many respects, that Committee led the world in trying to make some effort, after 40 years, to resolve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real challenge before the Sports Drug Agency in Australia and other agencies around the world is what will happen about the detection and elimination of the next generation of performance enhancing drugs. The area of particular concern is synthetic hormones such as EPO and the human growth hormone, or HGH. These new hormones, which are now corrupting elite sporting competition, are much more deadly than the steroids and stimulants they are replacing. The difficulty is that they are virtually impossible to detect by drug testers, who cannot really tell the difference between the hormone produced naturally by the body and the synthetic version introduced through a syringe. I understand that some of these hormones cannot be found even in urine samples; in others, the benefits of the hormones last for a week but all trace of the hormone responsible is gone within hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real concern is the attitude of elite sports men and women around the world and the fact that they have to turn to using such drugs to maintain their position. One of the things that sports administrators should be looking at very closely is the pressures that are put on sports men and women to perform. A lot of that is in the hype of the events; a lot relates to their money earning capacity; a lot of it has been brought about because of the high profile that elite sports have been given through world television and the benefits to sponsors and the like of having sporting stars sponsor their goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of some importance groups like the International Olympic Committee should examine some way in which some of these pressures can be removed so that we can get back to a reasonable sporting situation once again. I mentioned a couple of drugs of the present that are of concern&mdash;EPO and HGH. The side effects of those drugs are quite horrifying. I am sure nobody in either elite or amateur sports would like to experience the end effect on the human body of some of those drugs, which in many cases can certainly be death. We have already seen the possibility of those drugs contributing directly to the death of a number of cyclists around the world. That was particularly so in Holland. Some of the new drugs, of course, can have incredible effects in terms of malformation of the human body, both externally and internally, and can ultimately lead to the death of the athletes using them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency faces a monstrous challenge. The Opposition supports the agency in its work. We are delighted that the Government saw fit to appoint Professor Peter Baume as head of that agency. I am sure that a man of his stature and dedication will ensure that we continue to lead the world in trying to outlaw what is a dreadful situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not oppose these amendments. As I said earlier, this is the third time that this Bill has come before the Parliament in the last 15 months. I am not quite sure whether it reflects badly on some of the drafting. I have some concern that this may not be the last time that we see this Bill inasmuch as the changes that are happening now may require some amendments in the future. I just hope that the bipartisan spirit that presently exists between the Government and the Opposition in trying to eradicate the menace of drugs in sport will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some pleasure that I am here today to support the Opposition and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is in many ways unique in the world, in that it is an independent organisation which operates a testing regime which by any comparison is world-class. The reason for this amending legislation is that the legislation which was originally proposed to set up the agency was too pedantic and too detailed. These amendments will effectively allow for a bit more flexibility in the way in which samples are collected for testing by the agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation has arisen mainly because of the well publicised case of Martin Vinnicombe. Martin Vinnicombe was tested positively while he was training in the United States. He was tested by the Canadian agency with which the Australian Sports Drug Agency has an arrangement. Indeed, the testing was carried out in an IOC approved laboratory and under a regime which surely complied with the IOC requirements. Unfortunately, because of legal technicalities, an arbitration decision was made suggesting that the finding of a positive test against Martin Vinnicombe could not be upheld. Martin Vinnicombe admitted that he was a drug user, and that admission is on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was clear to all of us who were interested in this issue that there were anomalies in the legislation setting up the Australian Sports Drug Agency which required compliance with a large number of minor technical details and allowed for a legal technicality to absolve the athlete in this particular case. Of course, the absolution was not complete, because it was clear that Vinnicombe had admitted that he was a user. It was also clear that the test had been carried out in an IOC laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of some minor technical difficulties in the way in which the Canadian agency carried out its activities, which did not exactly comply with those laid down in our legislation, that we are today recommending some amendments, which will largely provide that, as long as the agency with which our agency has a relationship complies with the IOC criteria, testing in other countries by other agencies will be considered kosher. If that is the case, athletes will be placed on a register of notifiable events, and the appropriate sporting bodies and agencies in this country will receive notification of the status. The athlete, of course, will receive notification of the status and will have the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have in place a better piece of legislation because of these amendments, one which is more flexible and which takes into account the situation worldwide. We need to consider very carefully what the situation is worldwide because there are still athletes who use prohibited drugs. Many athletes are able to get away with the use of prohibited drugs, principally for two reasons. Firstly, many of the drugs they use are training agents, the sorts of agents that one uses to build up strength, speed and stamina in training but does not require at the time of competition. The present testing structure that we have, particularly for the Olympic Games, for example, relates to a competition testing regime. So if athletes are able to use these substances, particularly the anabolic steroids, which are perhaps the most effective, they can build up their strength, speed and stamina in a way which will give them an advantage at competition time when the drug has effectively been eliminated from their system and cannot be detected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason athletes are able to beat the system is that there are substances that athletes can use which are undetectable by the present testing system. The reason for that relates to the fact that there are pharmacological and scientific difficulties in establishing the efficacy of any testing program, and difficulties with collecting samples. The difficulties that exist are such that it is impossible, with our present knowledge, to have a testing structure which can catch all of those new developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those two reasons, I think we will find in Barcelona that there are still athletes with unfair advantages because of assistance by pharmacologists. That is unfortunate. In a month's time when those of us who are interested are watching the events in Barcelona we will need to ask: what is the nature of sport, why do we believe that it is an important part of our society, and what aspects would we like to see developed and continued? It is my personal view that, in effect, when we watch sporting competitions we see competition between individuals to see who can perhaps run the fastest, but run the fastest alone and unaided. If it were just about going fast one could use a motor bike and go very fast, and if it were only about winning one would run only against people one could always beat. But sport is about competition in which people can win or lose, and it is about competing against one another unaided, where the playing field, to use the vernacular, is level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe it is a health question. I do not believe it is a question of illegality in respect of some of these substances. As mature adults, the majority of these athletes have to make those sorts of decisions for themselves. But it should not be the case that someone who wants to compete in sporting competition has to risk his or her health or risk breaking the law in order to have an even chance. It is about those people who want to compete in sport on a level playing field having the opportunity to do so. It is incumbent on us and our society to develop a structure which will allow that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency has developed expertise in this area. It has particular independence and I believe it represents a very good model for other countries. It is very unfortunate that in many other countries we do not have the same structure or vigilance in the testing of athletes for these drugs which can enhance performance. The Opposition spokesman in this area, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), spoke about the Eastern bloc countries. I think he was speaking about a previous time, but it was clear that performance enhancing substances embellished their athletes' performances during the 1970s and 1980s. It was also very clear that the same pharmacological assistance was available to many athletes in Western countries. If that is to be the case and if the major substances that athletes will use are substances which will assist them in training, some credible random testing structure needs to be set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we have such a system in Australia, but the systems in countries overseas do not have the same credibility as our system. We certainly hope that such a structure will be developed. The Australian Sports Drug Agency presently has reciprocal agreements with countries such as Canada, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and a number of other countries are presently developing those sorts of regimes which will give some credibility to the random testing aspect of the problem. I think it is likely that before the next Olympiad&mdash;during the next four years&mdash;we will see further progress made in this area. The Australian Sports Drug Agency represents a good model and I hope that in the future we will find less legal challenge to the decisions of the agency and less use of legal technicalities in order to avoid the regulations of national sporting bodies such as the IOC and, indeed, bodies like the Australian Sports Drug Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill offers me an opportunity to speak about sport and we do not often have the opportunity to raise other issues in this place. I wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) only two days ago about an issue that particularly concerned me. I raised this issue reluctantly, but I believe it needs to be aired in the public domain. It related to the selection of athletes for the Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many sports in this country have very objective criteria for the selection of athletes. For instance, Duncan Armstrong, a hero from Seoul, failed to qualify in the first two places in the swimming event. So whilst he will be competing in Barcelona in the relay, he will not be defending his gold medal in the freestyle event. That is an example of the very objective criteria that we see applied by many sports in this country. Exactly the same thing occurs in the United States. Only last week we saw the example of Carl Lewis, arguably the greatest athlete of the century&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a point well taken. He is arguably the best athlete of the century, but he failed to make the US team for the 100 metres sprint to defend his title from Seoul because he was unable to finish in the first three places in the trial. Whilst that seems very harsh and difficult, the reality of competition at that level is that it is extremely competitive and in those circumstances it is necessary to set down objective criteria for selection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I wrote to the Minister last week was that in the 1,000 metres time trial for cycling a 17-year-old Western Australian, Darren Hill, failed to be selected and his place was taken by another athlete who will compete for Australia in Barcelona. I do not suggest that I am in a better position than those people in cycling to make that selection. What does concern me is the lack of any objective trial between the two contenders&mdash;Shane Kelly and Hill&mdash;in that particular event. It is interesting to note that Hill is the Australian champion; Kelly did not compete in the championships. Hill has a personal best which is two seconds faster than Kelly, and yet he has not been given an opportunity to be measured against the selected athlete in a head to head competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be justifiable reasons for this, but nobody has been able to suggest to me that the process is fair and objective. There is no suggestion that these two athletes have been, or will be, matched against one another in a way which will enable us to make such a judgment. Athletes are not asking for anything more than an opportunity to know what the selection criteria are, what the structure is and to have some chance of competing in that way. Just as we are here passing legislation which will allow athletes to compete on an even basis without the odour of drugs being part of that structure, we would like our athletes who may be selected to have some sorts of objective criteria laid down, whereby they will understand the hoops they have to jump through and can comply with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Hill, it is very clear that no such structure is in place. The Australian cycling coach, who happens to coach the other athlete, has a significant capacity to make a subjective judgment as to who should be in the team. We had the same problem in 1988 in respect of cycling. Until those criteria are improved in respect of that sport, we will continue to have these sorts of difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my letter to the Minister I also alluded to difficulties that I anticipate will occur in relation to gymnastics. Australia's women gymnasts have done outstandingly well in the last six to eight years. Indeed, their performance in finishing sixth in Indianapolis means that an Australian team of women gymnasts has qualified to compete in the Barcelona Olympics. In Canberra, nine girls&mdash;or perhaps 10&mdash;are presently involved in a training camp in which they are required to be tested according to a procedure which has been laid down and which appears to me to be relatively objective. According to their performance here and in other trials&mdash;two of which have already been held&mdash;they will be selected for Barcelona at the beginning of next month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What distresses me is that I am hearing concerns about the way in which that procedure is being undertaken and the way in which those criteria are being fulfilled. Indeed, just this morning I heard a most disturbing report, again about one of our Western Australian athletes. I understand that a young girl, Tracey Gibbs, has been told that she is no longer required at the camp. The reason for her not being required seems to me to be absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the requirements laid down in the camp is for these young gymnasts to fulfil particular criteria in relation to their weight and body make-up. One of the tests is a skin fold test in which seven sites on the body are pinched in a calibrated device which determines the skin fold thickness. Seven different readings are taken to arrive at a total. The girls have to register a reading of less than a total of 40 millimetres. When this girl was measured in Perth, her skin fold thickness was found to be 38 millimetres. She came across to the eastern States and it was found to be 44 millimetres. She was told the measurement was too high. A week later her skin fold thickness was down to 42 millimetres; today it is 38 millimetres. For the sake of one or two millimetres, in a test which has a margin of error of plus or minus three or four millimetres, she has been excluded from the possibility of continuing in the trial. I find that sort of heavy-handed approach unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training rules for gymnasts include the limiting of telephone calls, both incoming and outgoing, to rest days. These girls have one rest day a week. They are asked to come to Canberra for a training camp. They are away from their families for some months, and on one day a week they are allowed to make or receive telephone calls from their families. I know that the participants are not complying with these rules, but I find the fact that these rules can be laid down to be unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great concern about the way in which the selection of the gymnastics coaches and this team is likely to be determined. I am raising these issues today in anticipation that this will occur because I do not want to be seen as someone who is speaking after the event. On a number of occasions in this House I have raised concerns about the way in which the gymnastic programs at the AIS are structured and the way in which the money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I continue to raise these issues because they are important. It needs to be understood by the public that these young athletes train for years and years and they deserve a fair and honest assessment of their worth and their capacity. If they have an honest assessment of their worth and capacity, they have the ability to accept those sorts of decisions. It appears to me that the way in which the selection of this team and the coaches of this team is developing is flawed. Even though it is likely that three of the seven girls in the gymnastics team will be Western Australians, it may well be the case that their personal coach will be unable to be with them. An outstanding and world renowned gymnastics coach, like Andrei Rodionenko, may not be able to be at the Games to advise his athletes. If this is the outcome of events, it is a very sad and sorry state for gymnastics in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that to some extent I agree. We cannot be too hard on the sports administrators who are unpaid volunteers. I spent a good many years in representative sport. I played hockey, as did the honourable member for Perth. From time to time sports people who are not always of a delicate age&mdash;18 years, 19 years, 20 years or mid-20s&mdash;are treated like children. They are pushed around and made to conform to a set of rules that do not regard them as mature and very talented people. Any amateur sports person who has played a representative sport could tell a million stories of the conflict between sports people and amateur officials. But that is not the topic of the debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first contact with drugs in sport was in 1989. Chris Turner, a chap in my electorate who I think was the then president of the Australian Amateur Powerlifting Federation, came to me seeking some government funding to help form the Powerlifting Federation. His stories pointed to the contrast between his Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation and the fact that&mdash;we have become used to this over time&mdash;in weight-lifting there has been a significant amount of steroid use and so on to build up weight-lifters to enable them, under the pressure of competition, to perform at their peak. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out&mdash;I am reading a response I had from the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;we were unable to help Chris at that time with funding. But I know he continues to be an activist in the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation. Senator Graham Richardson, at that time, had suggested an amalgamation between the two forms of weight-lifting. In fact, Senator Richardson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the future of the sport of powerlifting in Australia a possible solution could be for the two national organisations to amalgamate and work together for a drug free sport scene from within the existing national structure.</PARA>
<PARA>I was grateful to Senator Richardson for that response and, although it did not carry money, we did impress upon Chris Turner the need for him to work amongst his own people for the continuation of a drug free powerlifting federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this general area, I would like to acknowledge the work of the former politician&mdash;now deceased in a political sense&mdash;Senator John Black from Queensland. His Senate committee, of course, made great inroads into the prevalence of drug use in sport and the importance of having a monitoring system that was both fair and foolproof. As I understand it, legislation has now been passed and it has become somewhat of a model for international systems of testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a testing system is set up, it inevitably becomes tested. In the Vinnicombe case it was not so much that Martin had not taken the drugs, but that all the processes of testing him had not gone absolutely according to the rules. He was able to not take the full consequences of the law at that time because all the proper procedures had not been followed. It is desirable that in this Bill we amend the Act to make the sense of the law true, even if every single point is not followed. As I understand it, we are allowing a little flexibility. If someone has clearly taken drugs, then that person has to suffer the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the athlete's side&mdash;this is not at all to excuse anyone's actions in taking drugs&mdash;we need to keep in mind the pressures now on sports people at an international level. We need to give them support and assistance. If someone has been forced to take that awful step of taking drugs, then that in itself&mdash;to use the phrase&mdash;is a cry for help. That person is saying to us, `Hey, there is no way I can compete against X, Y and Z at this level unless I cheat as they do'. That is a pity. That is the beauty of having a set of international rules that say, `Listen, Martin or whoever, don't use the drugs any more, mate, because, as best we can, we'll ensure that your competitors are also drug free'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone had spent 10 or 15 years of his life reaching his peak as an athlete, he would hate to be knocked off by someone else who had been cheating. Some people have been foolish enough to try to compete not only in the game in which they are involved but also in the game of cheating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank John Black and his Senate committee for bringing to prominence this matter and ensuring that athletes are protected from having to take drugs. An Australian athlete should not have to compete against someone who clearly has been taking performance enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a more open world, athletes representing nations having less regard for rules on the taking of drugs will not be able to hide behind the iron curtain of sport. We can now be much more certain that at the next Olympics all athletes competing will be drug free; they will be under great scrutiny. If they are taking drugs, it is quite likely that they will be found out and, of course, the full weight and consequence of the law will be brought to bear on their sporting career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a general remark and note my appreciation of the work done in this area by the Department, by officials and by sporting officials. They have had to come to grips with this enormous difficulty. It has really taken the edge off the international sporting scene.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular athlete who admitted to taking drugs was able to escape the full force of this law because the testing undertaken, as I understand it, did not comply with every single step that had been laid down. We have now learned the lesson that one does not make some of these procedures so specific that it can be argued that a procedure was not complied with in full so that someone can then get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Martin Vinnicombe is back on the cycling scene. I think he realises the damage he has done to the great sport of cycling. I do not know Martin but, having heard a number of interviews with him, I think he is an intelligent enough bloke to have made a clean break, and he will now be working within the cycling sport to encourage and support other athletes so that they are not tempted to go along with taking performance enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall refer to some features of the Bill and to the swapping of powers amongst the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth over the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary anti-doping legislation currently proposed by all the States and Territories. It will also allow the agency to work more closely with the States and Territories to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug Agency may now enter into. The agency may be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so that it can act on the result of those tests. The amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. I believe this was the critical error we made initially; that is, we were too precise in laying out procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter Against Doping in Sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations. It is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic charter. It is the work of lawyers to make sure that, where things are outlined very precisely, there are difficulties: it gives more grounds for an argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides an athlete with the opportunity to make a submission to the agency challenging the validity of a positive test result if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas are not complied with: sealing of the container holding the sample; testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory; or evidence of tampering with the sample. If the agency decides that the test was valid, the competitor will be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. If the AAT reverses the agency's decision, then the competitor's name must be removed from the register. Even if the athlete does not make a submission, the agency will be required to verify that all procedures relating to these specific matters were followed before validating a positive test result. It will no longer be required to check procedures where non-compliance would not cast doubt on the test result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments provide for written notification to approved sporting and anti-doping organisations of a positive test result or a refusal to provide a sample. Where this is not possible, alternative arrangements have been provided so that athletes cannot hinder the process by purposefully avoiding the notice. Many international sporting federations require advice of a possible positive test result to satisfy their own anti-doping policy. The Bill we are debating will enable the agency to satisfy such requests in certain specified circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name of the register will be changed to the Register of Notifiable Events. This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of guilt. The notion of guilt was never intended to be associated with the entry of names on the register. The question of guilt and application of sanctions is, and has always been, a matter for sporting organisations and not the agency. The Bill also recognises the need to give minors special consideration by providing for the removal of a name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed if at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency is increasingly being recognised overseas and domestically as having the professional expertise to arrange for the collection and testing of samples to detect the presence of prohibited drugs and, therefore, will be called on more and more to arrange such tests overseas and in Australia at the request of both overseas and Australian authorities and sporting organisations. The Bill includes amendments which will give it the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments, other sporting organisations and anti-doping authorities for the collection and testing of samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other minor amendments to the Act. We have here another chapter in what has become a good story. We are now providing protection for all athletes to compete on their merits. An athlete will be able to be sufficiently relaxed to know that when he is out there competing, putting the whole of his life into his event, he can be pretty well sure that those with whom he is competing are not using performance enhancing drugs. We will go back to having a sporting arena that is clean, one in which each of us can trust the end result; that is, that the one who finished No. 1 did so on his or her merits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the International Air Services Commission Bill 1992 because it is the start of a new era of international aviation in Australia. Since the ill-fated One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) we have had a number of policy announcements about the establishment of this independent authority to allocate capacity to Australian carriers under the new international aviation regime. One aspect of that regime is the introduction of dual designated carriers from Australia. The Opposition has some concerns, but I point out that we will not be opposing this Bill. I would like the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to respond to some questions on the operation of the International Air Services Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Commission will have a staff of 12. I find that quite fascinating. I confess that, in terms of the formulation of the Opposition's policy on aviation, we were looking to a similar commission. The best I could manage, at the absolute maximum, was seven staff. I am absolutely amazed that the Government is going along this track, setting up what could be a monstrosity in terms of staffing and its allocation and, not only that, but imposing $2.2m in costs on this Commission in the first year of its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the situation, we will have a part time chairman working three days a week; two members working one day per week each; one secretary at the second level of the SES; three divisional heads, class 11; and five research and support staff. For what we are trying to achieve in relation to the allocation of international aviation rights to Australian carriers only, that would seem to be an absolutely massive number of staff. I wonder whether this piece of legislation has been rushed through. Maybe not the best advice has been taken from the Government on the structure this Commission may undertake. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The taxpayers are paying for this. If this Commission was designed, as it should be, to be a completely transparent vehicle overlooking the allocation of all international air routes in Australia, there may be some justification for putting up that staff. I understand that, at the moment, advertisements are being called for the manning of this Commission. It will be interesting to see whether people in the present department want to transfer over, or whether they find, when they get there, that they are absolutely bored stiff with nothing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that lightly or in a silly sense, because I have studied the commissions that have been set up overseas&mdash;particularly those in Great Britain and the United States&mdash;and the way in which they allocate international routes. I suppose the comparison with the United Kingdom is not necessarily a good one, because it goes a little further than we do. Its commission is, in a sense, a court. An airline can make an application to run on a particular route and that application could be challenged by any other airline. A battle royal has developed in the United Kingdom between the aviation lawyers. These battles cost airlines millions and millions of dollars annually to meet the requirements. I must say, in favour of the UK situation, that at least the whole process is very transparent. It is absolutely essential that we try to get that transparency on the allocation of international air routes in Australia. This is one of the concerns that I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airlines do not want to sell their sovereignty and the Government must have some control on the allocation of air routes. We are not going terribly further down the track than the situation that has absolutely stifled the development of international aviation and international tourism in this country for the past 20 years; that is, the decision to allocate air routes is the responsibility of the Government, the Department and the Minister. For no reason at all applications will not necessarily be issued. I will cite a couple of examples. For 14 years Korean Air applied for air routes into Australia, and for 14 years it was knocked back. The Scandinavian airline system applied for 16 years for rights into Australia, and for 16 years it was knocked back. Do we not look dills, when one of the biggest growth areas we have for world tourism is Korea? We are four years behind the times in the development of that market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest percentage growth areas of international tourism into Australia at the moment is the Scandinavian market. There were 42,000 Scandinavian tourists last year. We have neglected that market since way back. What should have happened was the opening up of the Australian aviation system at the time of that dreadful ICAO situation that existed in the early 1970s, when all of a sudden we were found out for being overprotectionist and charging much more than we ever should for our international air fares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has some other worries with the establishment of this Commission. While the allocation of routes is very much at the forefront&mdash;it will be possible for Australian carriers to go in there and claim some of the excess capacity that presently exists within the agreements&mdash;we have made absolutely no provision, as I read this Bill, for the allocation of charter rights. While this Government bleats and trumpets about what it has done for the development of charter traffic in and out of Australia, in reality very little has been done over the last 10 years. We have a couple of charters that come in from Britannia Airways. I understand the Minister announced a week or two ago that we will have a couple of flights in from Indonesia. There has never been a realisation, until now, as to the possibility of opening up this country to mass tourism traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely delighted in a meeting I had a couple of weeks ago with the Chairman and chief executive officer of Qantas. I learnt that, all of a sudden, Qantas had seen the light and it can see the tremendous advantages in developing charter markets, which it is doing out of some of the secondary airports in Japan, and as it has been doing with the market in and out of Vietnam. I hope that we might be able to allocate those charter rights, for Australian charter carriers, into this particular system. There are huge markets out there that are waiting to be developed. I want to see Australian carriers being given the opportunity of getting into some of those markets. If we look at the structure and fares that are available for the opening up of those new markets, we see that charters are the way to go. They are certainly the way to go if we are to develop some of the regional areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what has happened overseas in places such as the United Kingdom and Germany, where 56 per cent of the total international traffic is carried by the charter operators, we can see how far behind the times we are. There has to be this major revolution in the development of aviation policy in Australia. A few months ago the World Tourism Organisation estimated that, by the year 2000, 140 million Asian people will be travelling offshore annually for their holidays. If Australia could pick up 5 per cent of that market, frankly, we could not handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Government's target of 6 1/2 million international visitors by the year 2000, or if we look at the Opposition's peak target, getting up towards the 10 million mark, the plain facts of the matter are that we are going to have to triple the capacity of international carriers in and out of Australia. The pressure on the domestic market will be huge and we will probably have to double the size of the domestic fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment that will be needed to be made is enormous for the infrastructure that is required. While we have been debating the development of the third runway in Sydney, the third runway has become pretty small fry in relation to those figures. Right now we should be looking at the development of the second international airport for Sydney. There has to be major investment in the development of Melbourne. The farce that exists in Brisbane with the international terminal has to be overcome virtually tomorrow. We are going to have problems with some of the lesser ports unless we start making some of those decisions now. We should be prepared to stand up and say that we are genuine about the development of international tourism and aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A most important part of that will be the nurturing of charter traffic into Australia. In a time of very high unemployment, the fact that we have not got the charter operators involved in this matter worries me. I think there is tremendous potential for future Australian owned charter operators to start getting into some of that international business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, when in government, will be looking at the operation of this Commission. We want to broaden its scope. We have concerns about the staffing of it, and we certainly have concerns about the costing of it&mdash;$2.2m in its first 12 months. Let us hope that we can get some sort of bipartisan attitude between the Government and the Opposition to make sure that, at long last, even 20 years too late, we are prepared to take on the proper development of international aviation in Australia. We can then catch up with the rest of the world in the pricing policies and the opportunities that are there, so that we can see the benefit of that pass on to all Australians. At a time when we have very high unemployment, we have the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in our growing tourist industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen that reference by Senator Cook. I can only assume that, as the shadow Minister quotes it, it is correct. There would be all sorts of reasons why we have seen this phenomenon of suicides amongst young people. No doubt all social circumstances would bear upon that. But if the honourable gentleman is trying to make the point that youth unemployment, as it exists today as distinct from other periods in Australia's economic history, is the singular cause for a shift in suicide levels amongst young people, I think it is wrong and a poor political point to try to make.</PARA></TALK.START>

A lot of the unskilled jobs, which young people are able to do, are now largely done by sophisticated equipment or by technology of one form or another. This is particularly true in clerical areas, retailing and other areas. There has been a marked shift away from the employment of young people in these areas.There are still clear areas where young people are preferred, such as apprenticeships, but they are now a relatively small area of the labour market for young people.</PARA>

A couple of weeks ago we had the honourable member for Bennelong pining over the loss of so-called untrained, dead-end jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not responsible for the putting together of State Budgets; those State governments must take responsibility for their own actions. But we are concerned, understandably, about the inflationary impact. The way in which States make easy resort to these charges may help their Budgets, but at the same time it will have an effect on Australia's inflation rate. The charges announced by Victoria and New South Wales alone will add one-half of one per cent to Australia-wide CPI inflation through the course of 1992-93 and about three-quarters of one per cent to the inflation in those two States. If these increases were replicated in the other States and Territories, the total impact on Australia's inflation rate would be around three-quarters of one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 12 months to March 1992, Australia recorded an inflation rate of only 1.7 per cent&mdash;the best inflation performance since the early 1960s. Our underlying rate of inflation is between 2 1/2 per cent and 3 per cent&mdash;the best result since this measure was first initiated during the early 1970s. Even more important than that, our inflation rate is now below that of our major trading partners, which is helping to improve our international competitiveness. That helps to underline the point that improved competitiveness is fundamental to sustained employment and economic growth in this country. These increases in taxes and charges obviously will not assist in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to bear in mind the context in which these increases were made. There will be an increase in revenue to the States of almost 5 per cent of the financial assistance grants base, which is far in excess of the 2 per cent increase that the Premiers sought at the conference. Some of the Premiers sought a 2 per cent increase. They have imposed increases of 5 per cent. That means that it is not possible by any stretch of the imagination to justify these increases on the outcome of the Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $500m increase in funding&mdash;that is, general revenue and hospital grants&mdash;provided by the Commonwealth stands in sharp contrast to the cuts the Opposition has in mind for State funding. The Opposition proposes to cut the funding to the States by $900m each year. In other words, rather than providing for a real increase in funding for the States, what the Opposition has in mind is a real reduction. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the States were to respond, as one might anticipate they would, by resorting to increases in taxes and charges, that would have a very significant and damaging effect on the inflation rate as a result of the Opposition's policies. That is in excess of the other direct inflationary impact of the introduction of a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if the Opposition were to impose the cuts it has in mind on the States, that would add an additional 1 1/2 per cent to inflation if, as we have seen on this occasion, the States were to respond to those cuts by increasing their own taxes and charges. This, of course, means that inflation under the Opposition's policies would increase by well over 6 per cent; in other words, by four times the level that it now is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This just underscores the point that the estimates have made about the impact on ordinary households in Australia, indicating that about 70 per cent of wage and salary earners and 60 per cent of the self-employed and farm householders would be worse off as a result of the Opposition's package. This does not even take into account the $6 1/2 billion expenditure cuts which the Opposition has in mind. When we add to that a 1 1/2 per cent kick from inflation, we realise the dramatic, drastic and tragic impact that ordinary Australians would feel as a result of these proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, therefore, that we have seen the Opposition curiously silent, both on the outcome of the Premiers Conference and in terms of its response to the States in relation to State taxation. Not only does the Opposition know that, as a result of its policies, the States would get less, but also it would anticipate that the States would resort to these inflationary taxes in order to make up the shortfall which would be visited upon them by a coalition government. That is why the Opposition is saying nothing&mdash;because it intends to further extend the damage of its policies on ordinary Australians.</PARA>

The GST will have a quite adverse impact on the LPG industry&mdash;once again, an industry now employing literally thousands of people in this country, many of them dispersed through regional Australia, where unemployment is unfortunately being felt very strongly. The industry has contacted the Opposition, through the Leader of the National Party, and has entered into discussions with him in relation to the potential impact on that industry. We need go to no higher authority in relation to the adverse impacts of the Opposition package on the LPG industry than the honourable member for Mayo who, in his journey from shadow Minister for trade to shadow Minister for defence of the realm, was diverted. He turned the guns on his own Party when he conceded publicly that `anyone seeking to convert their motor vehicle to LPG under the GST policy proposals would be crazy'. He is a great authority on this issue. Of course, anyone doing that would be crazy, but unfortunately it goes much further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month or so ago a major Australian company had occasion to discuss with me a major project of nearly $100m to be developed in this country which was to do, of course, with an alternative energy source.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This company came to me and indicated that it was in a very advanced stage indeed in terms of this nearly $100m major project for an alternative fuel development and that its bankers were loath to provide the necessary funds given the uncertainty engendered for the industry by the GST policy package. The Leader of the National Party and I know that this company has raised the matter with him. The Leader of the National Party and I know that for reasons&mdash;and quite properly&mdash;of commercial confidentiality, I am not able to go into any greater detail. But the Leader of the National Party and I know that this major project will be stopped dead in its tracks unless this policy regime changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition comes into the chamber and talks about the issue of employment. I am telling the Opposition, not as an assertion but as a matter of fact, that if it changes the GST in terms of some of these impacts it will create jobs as of tomorrow. It is the uncertainty engendered by this mad policy that is leading to the loss of job opportunities today in this country. But all is not lost, because the Opposition, with all of the consistency that it has shown in relation to this matter, is doing a back-flip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party has entertained discussions with industry&mdash;and why would he not, because the industry has indicated that the Opposition would last `24 hours' if its policy were ever implemented?  What is being discussed is just another aspect of the haemorrhaging of the Fightback package, the back-flip package. What is being discussed by the Leader of the National Party&mdash;I know not whether it is with the concurrence, implied or otherwise, of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;in the privacy of his room is a back-flip on this policy, one that, would you believe, will provide rebates for those who convert their motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that were to be the case it would, of course, represent another haemorrhaging of the Fightback package, the fiscal lack of integrity of the Fightback package. Moreover, and more importantly, it would not address the issue, because the problem for the industry is the price relativity problem that the Opposition has created. This is another example of where the Opposition, coming into this chamber and talking about jobs and its own policy prescriptions, is not theoretically or prospectively preventing jobs. Those opposite are stopping the jobs here now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the rate of youth unemployment in Australia is now over 34 per cent and that in Victoria it is over 46 per cent?  Why has the Prime Minister falsely claimed that the rate of youth unemployment is only one in 10?  Why does he insult the youth of Australia and their parents, who are trying to struggle through his recession, by telling them that they should get their problem into perspective?  When will he apologise for these callous, insensitive and inaccurate remarks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The claims in the Leader of the Opposition's question are wrong. There are 122,000 young people looking for work in an age cohort of 1.3 million. That is just around 10 per cent. That is the position. But for the Leader of the Opposition to have the gall to try to suggest that the Government should operate a policy response from a distortion run on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne and to think that Government policy is going to be run off distortions is the joke of jokes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may come as a piece of unhelpful information to the Leader of the Opposition but there were more people in this age cohort unemployed in 1982-83 than there are today&mdash;as a result of the policies which he had in place then. But, unemployed as they are, I have made it abundantly clear that the Government, and only the Government, is in a position to deal markedly with this problem. That is the whole point of the meeting on youth policy and employment&mdash;to get the breakthroughs in training, training wages and technical and further education which coalition governments were never interested in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether it is 10 per cent is immaterial; it is still too high and we need to do something about it. But to go on with this sort of vindictive approach to these people, as though we want to try to stigmatise them as being a group who look at themselves as being 46 per cent unemployed&mdash;that is, saying to a group of 15- to 19-year-olds that 46 per cent of them are out of work when it is not true&mdash;is to ruin optimism which they might have about training themselves and finding employment. This Government has always supported rational policy analysis on the facts. We are not going to take the facts to mean whatever comes off the top of the head of some subeditor at the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, or any other newspaper, who wants to sensationalise and damn this group of young people to the pessimism of unemployment levels which do not obtain.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of all Australians, I have to say we are appalled at the continuing violence in South Africa. On 17 June, 39 innocent people, including women and children, were massacred at the township of Boipatong. There were three further deaths and 20 casualties during President de Klerk's visit to the township on 20 June. To date, this sort of violence has cost the lives of more than 1,400 people this year. We believe it is essential that the South African Government do everything in its power to end the violence and bring those responsible to account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are deeply concerned that the escalation of violence has now led to the ANC withdrawing from the Convention for a Democratic South Africa&mdash;Codesa&mdash;process and from bilateral talks with the South African Government. We hope that conditions can be created which will permit a return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and that all the progress which we have seen in South Africa to date will not be tragically lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the House will know, Australia has played a leading role within the Commonwealth in developing a sanctions policy towards South Africa. These recent events clearly demonstrate that our phased approach to lifting sanctions has been correct. The Government is currently consulting our Commonwealth partners and other concerned countries about our responses to these latest events. If the parties in South Africa wish it, Australia is ready to participate in an international observer or investigatory mechanism. The aim of such a mechanism would be to help restore confidence in the process of political dialogue between the parties and to discourage violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans has already discussed this possibility earlier today with his Canadian counterpart but, until we have consulted widely, it is premature to say precisely what the role of an international observer group might be or what Australia's contribution might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware of a call by Archbishop Tutu that the South African team should withdraw from the Barcelona Olympics if certain demands are not met. He has also raised the question of the Wallabies rugby union tour of South Africa planned for August. All I will say about that at this time is that the Government is keeping in close touch with other governments and Australian sporting bodies in relation to these issues. As I said on 22 June, it would be premature for us to take any final decisions until we see how the South African Government handles the situation in coming days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the key to it is that the Government of South Africa do everything possible to end the violence and bring those responsible for the violence in Boipatong to account, that it reach a position where a resumption of bilateral talks occurs, that the process for democratic South Africa continue to be a process of viability and that the conditions be created which will permit a return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. That must be the reasonable and decent hope of every Australian.</PARA>

That is a matter of fact. It is also a matter of fact that 122,000 young people, out of an age cohort of 1.3 million, are in the labour market looking for work. That is a fact. It may not suit the Leader of the Opposition, who would prefer to frighten young people out of their wits, to damn in them any hope of finding a job, and generally to do as he normally does: prey upon Australians, young and old, with his pessimism and gloom, hoping that it will advance his miserable political cause.

Ignorance was total bliss on the part of the coalition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, he keeps using it. At that time I did draw attention to the shortcomings of the banks, particularly as they attempt to repair their condition after the excesses of the 1980s. I do not think it is true to say, as the Opposition Leader contends, that I received a bucketing for my remarks. Indeed, there have been some events subsequently, of which he would not be aware, which would confound what the Opposition Leader has asserted here today. So perhaps once again he was wrongly advised of the proceedings of that occasion by his coalition partner, the Leader of the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an essential transformation of the importance of banks in the financial system over the last 10 years. In 1983 the banks had but 53 per cent of the bank and non-bank financial system whereas now they have 70 per cent, which restores the position they had in the early 1960s. The point is that the banks are an important part of the financial system, will play an important role in the operation of the economy and will play a crucial role in the development of the recovery as it proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was making the point to the banks that we saw them as having an important role. We wanted to ensure that they were in a position to perform that role. I underlined the changes that we made in the Prime Minister's February statement about improving the capacity of the banks to respond to the circumstances of businesses which were in difficult circumstances and which needed the help of the banks to work themselves out of their current position when they were basically viable but going through obviously difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point to the banks that it was not enough simply for them to offer concessions to new customers or potential new customers while not extending the same kinds of conditions to some of their existing customers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see the banks as having an important role. We wish to support them in that role. But we are concerned about the very low growth in credit&mdash;a matter which the Governor of the Reserve Bank drew attention to just today in a speech he made in Townsville where he said, `It is almost certainly the case that some bank managers are being excessively cautious notwithstanding head office directives'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the banks have to understand that they have this role to play&mdash;I think they do appreciate it&mdash;but it is not enough simply for their chief executives and those who attend the ABA annual dinner to understand that; it is important for them to extend that message out into their branch network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point that, as well as considering the concerns of small business, they must also take into account the interests of the farming sector, because those in the farming sector have been obviously affected by changes in world markets and changes brought about by drought in Australia. They need an opportunity to restore their positions to a state of health and they need the support and encouragement of the banks in that process.</PARA>

The honourable member for Bennelong will not mind me telling a classic story&mdash;it is against him, but it is not a harmful one. Apparently in the preparation of Budget Statement No. 2 in 1982&mdash;the text on the economy past and present&mdash;the then Treasurer said to the Secretary of the Treasury, `How is statement 2 going, John'? `Quite well, Treasurer. I think you will see that we have done a workmanlike job, and when you see it you will be proud of it'. `Good. Thank you, John'. That was Statement No. 2 from the Treasury.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for that question, particularly as it refers to two areas&mdash;sole parent pensions and age pensions&mdash;where I think the Government by a combination of humane provision, proper targeting and getting the right incentives can be very proud of its achievement of reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will discuss the sole parent's pension first. Here the Government has implemented a number of sensitive and constructive proposals to get sole parents back into the work force and to enhance their life opportunities. A report came down in the Senate today on the jobs, education and training scheme, the JET scheme&mdash;the evaluation report&mdash;which I think points out the achievements of that scheme, supported widely by clients, employers and community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the years since 1989, when the JET scheme was implemented, 80,000 clients have made use of it&mdash;a very good response. Looking at the results in December 1991, we see that 25 per cent of JET clients were declaring earnings compared with only 11 per cent of them declaring earnings prior to getting on to that scheme. Remember that that doubling of the number has occurred in a very difficult job market. The job market situation for sole parents is a very difficult one, but the scheme has resulted in a doubling of declarations of earnings from that group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those kinds of sensitive and constructive policies are a very stark contrast to what we are offered from the Opposition in this area. Its proposal for sole parents is to cut sole parents off the pension when their youngest child turns 12. That is, some 30,000 sole parents will be, on the whole, simply shifted across to unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Leader of the Opposition spoke at the Castlemaine Club luncheon in Brisbane and said of that decision, `It's a simple choice'. Let me tell the Opposition that it is only a simple choice if it is prepared to pander to cheap public prejudice about sole parents&mdash;to that shabby stereotype that nearly all sole parents are young, unmarried women having children to get onto social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the facts, one finds that it is not a simple choice. Eighty per cent of sole parents have either been married or lived in recognised de facto relationships. Some 2,000 or 3,000 of those sole parent pensioners are widows or widowers. It does not become a simple choice once one looks at the hard facts. But of course the level of social thinking from the Opposition on this issue is reflected by a previous shadow spokesman for social security who said that it was a good idea for sole parents to get into the work force because they might manage to find a partner. That is the level and depth of social thinking involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the aged, the previous shadow Minister for social security was speculating in the Senate last week on how it would be possible to control the rising cost of age pensions. This is Senator Alston's speculation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic reforms in bio-technology . . . I am saying that there will be so many technological changes in bio-technology that we may well find that the cost of maintaining the elderly is actually a great deal cheaper than it is today.</PARA>

The result of those policies is that we have increased the age pension, the basic pension, to above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, as we promised. That represents, in real terms, an increase of over 13 per cent in the age pension. We have reformed the taxation area so that no pensioner on the basic rate or, even now, up to the free area pays any tax. We have extended pharmaceutical benefits to all pensioners. In rent assistance, which is an obvious source of poverty for some old people, there have been massive increases. We have given stability to the pension through not only the standard indexation but also by indexing fringe benefit limits and indexing the free area limits&mdash;trying to provide the kind of stability that people want in their old age.

I said then that all our efforts should go towards uniting the country. I also said we should combine a more efficient  economy with a fairer and more equitable  society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 May this year it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum to give the Commonwealth the power to legislate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. On that occasion I said that, as a nation, we have not yet succeeded in meeting the challenge set by the triumphant referendum result. Today, there is no more central issue to our national identity and self-esteem than the injustices brought home to us all by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There is nothing more central to our reputation in the world or to the kind of democratic, just society to which we aspire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The needs are clear. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have about half the average yearly income of other Australians. Participation by Aboriginal young people in post-school education is around a fifth of the rate for non-Aboriginal young people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all age groups have mortality rates almost three times higher than for the overall population. The custody rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is 29 times that of the general community. These few statistics give some idea of what the Royal Commission called `the disadvantaged and unequal position' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all aspects of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth sees the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as a national opportunity for genuine change in the lives of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. On behalf of the Government, I would like to say again how much we appreciate the work of the royal commissioners and their staff. Their work documented a tragic waste of life. The Royal Commission investigated the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody. But at least 30 more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have died in custody since the Royal Commission finished its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that nothing can remove the grief, anger and loss felt by the families, relatives and friends of those who died. But it is fundamentality important that the Royal Commission found the real killer. The responsibility lies in large measure with entrenched, institutionalised racism and discrimination. Those who died were victims of over two centuries of dispossession, prejudice and neglect. We cannot evade these harsh truths. Nor should we. But we can work to change them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March this year, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) tabled responses by the Commonwealth and all mainland State and Territory governments to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This kind of cooperation is a truly national achievement, crossing boundaries of jurisdiction and politics.  Its importance cannot  be minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our response to the Royal Commission, the Commonwealth supported all but one of the Royal Commission's recommendations. We allocated $150m over five years for law and justice initiatives and to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their own efforts to overcome alcohol and substance abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I am proud to announce the second stage of the Commonwealth's response&mdash;a concerted attack on the economic and social disadvantage, which is reflected nowhere more starkly than in the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody, and a renewal of our commitment to empower Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. These measures entail an additional $250m over five years, taking the total Commonwealth expenditure in response to the Royal Commission, over five years, to $400m. In difficult times, this level of funds is not easy to find. But the need must be faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission's report described the efforts, initiatives and dedication of Aboriginal people and communities and organisations across Australia to protect their culture, restore self-esteem and achieve real equality.

Elected commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission now make national decisions in Aboriginal affairs.

The knowledge and expertise of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations are now vital in developing and delivering important Commonwealth programs and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning, the ATSIC commissioners had a major role in shaping the responses by governments to the Royal Commission. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Commonwealth's gratitude to the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, and to the commissioners for their dedication. I should particularly like to thank the commissioners and regional councillors of ATSIC for their efforts over many months of consultations and negotiations to ensure the best possible responses by governments to the Royal Commission. The ATSIC commissioners were closely involved in developing the measures I am announcing today and endorsed this package of measures before it was considered by Cabinet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me first state that I believe the work and the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody are a major watershed in Aboriginal affairs in Australia. It is true that many of us on this side of the House had very grave reservations about the effectiveness of the Commission when it was first established in October 1987. There is no denying that it was an expensive exercise. In the end it cost over $30m. Yet when we read some parts of the report and pay particular attention to Commissioner Johnston's insights, we begin to accept that $30m was a worthwhile price to pay. </PARA>

But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material which has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will excuse the monumental hypocrisy of the other side. The Commission's exhaustive analysis is not just of the events that led to the 99 deaths in custody. It is also a genuine attempt to recommend real solutions to what are now deep-seated social and economic problems affecting the Aboriginal community. In both respects it has laid the foundation for building a better Australia for Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has also shown us that there is considerable agreement nationwide as to the way forward. The coalition's overriding concern is to ensure that all factors leading to the 99 deaths in custody are fully and adequately addressed. The law and justice and alcohol abuse sections of the report, to which the Government responded in Parliament in March of this year, recommended a raft of solutions relating to improved Aboriginal police relations, improved custody and legal service procedures and enhanced awareness of Aboriginal history, culture and disadvantage by those dealing with Aboriginal law-breakers. In responding to that section of the report, the Government committed $150m over five years to implement the necessary reforms in those areas. The coalition supported that decision and in government will carry through with that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the additional expenditure committed today by the Prime Minister dealing with programs relating to education, training and employment is supported in principle by the coalition. We do not begrudge this money being spent to enhance the employment and education prospects of the Aboriginal people, but we will be particularly concerned to ensure&mdash;as the Government does not seem to care&mdash;that such money is well spent and that it will produce practical and lasting improvements for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, past experience gives us little cause for confidence in that regard. For example, I have often emphasised that better structures and procedures in the administration of Aboriginal affairs are needed to effectively achieve the desired outcomes. As I said in my speech commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, the Australian community has literally waged war on Aboriginal disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth spending in 1970 was approximately $50m. Today, it approaches $1.2 billion. There is no denying, of course, that there has been some real progress and that in some areas some of that money has been well targeted. Twenty years ago, there were just 72 Aborigines attending university. Now that figure is closer to 4,000. Twenty years ago, 67 per cent of Aboriginal families were classed as very poor. Today that figure has fallen to 43 per cent although, disturbingly, a large additional percentage is now described as rather poor. Yet if this improvement has led to increased welfare dependence, rather than real improvements in the standards of living for Aboriginal people, it has to be said that little real progress has been made over the past two decades for the great majority of Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that, in some parts of Australia where there has been real progress, it has been despite government rather than because of government. As Charles Perkins would say, `They got tired of waiting and did it themselves'. Daly River, Robinson River, Wallace Rock Hole and Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory and Port Lincoln in South Australia are just a few of the communities which have done the hard work and whose people are now reaping the social rewards, as well as regaining their dignity and their self-respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in so many other areas of Aboriginal life, little or no real progress has been made. The Prime Minister referred specifically to some of these areas in his remarks today. Yet there are many more. I just give the House a couple of examples. The state of Aboriginal health is a national disgrace. Today in Australia, Aboriginal male life expectancy is 17 to 18 years less than for the general population. In parts of Australia, life expectancy is actually decreasing. In central Australia, the life expectancy for an adult male is just over 40 years of age&mdash;this at a</PARA>
<PARA>time when Aboriginal infant mortality is steadily improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is the problem of sexually transmitted diseases in many remote parts of Aboriginal Australia. It is an endemic problem, with up to 40 per cent of all Aborigines affected and with the potential for AIDS. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Where are these and other problems addressed in the Prime Minister's statement today?  Action must be taken soon to address the most serious of the threats to the Aboriginal community. It is why we, in government, will redirect, for example, a substantial portion of current AIDS funding to assist the Aboriginal community to deal with that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More broadly, Aboriginal education, literacy, housing and employment opportunities still fall well short of what a country like Australia should be able to deliver to its indigenous peoples. In the area of Aboriginal employment, the unemployment rate has increased. It went from 18.8 per cent in 1976 to 24.7 per cent in 1981 and 35.3 per cent in 1986. Today it hovers somewhere around the 40 to 50 per cent mark. Only 2 to 3 per cent of Aborigines are self-employed, compared with 15 per cent for the rest of the population. There is absolutely no effective program in operation now which encourages and assists Aborigines to enter businesses for themselves. What all this shows is that we continue to fall short of the standards set by governments and expected by Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countless well-meaning programs devised by countless well-meaning Ministers and bureaucrats may well have given them a warm inner glow, but they have often led nowhere or, even worse, cruelly raised expectations only to dash them subsequently. My concern is that the Prime Minister seems to believe that another $50m per year over the next five years on top of the ready $1,150m that is already spent per year on Aboriginal assistance will make the difference between success and failure. Quite clearly it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk of the failures in Aboriginal affairs the tendency is invariably to lay the blame at somebody's feet, and often there is a tendency to begin by blaming the Aborigines themselves. Quite frankly, until Canberra and the well-meaning bureaucrats get out of the way of the Aboriginal people and give them greater scope to chart their own course, they will have little cause to thank us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Aboriginal people want to be more responsible for themselves as individuals and collectively. They want to share in an expanding economy which this Government has failed to deliver. They, perhaps more than any other group in this country, cannot understand why, in a country that is so wealthy and well placed as Australia, they have been allowed to fall, or have been pushed, so far off the pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talked today of creating jobs for Aboriginal people and of creating economic independence. But his only answer has been to offer more money, with little improvement in the effectiveness of its delivery or in accountability. There are, of course, many other ways and more immediate ways to give Aboriginal people a better chance to make it on their own. For example, why will the Prime Minister not agree to the mining of Coronation Hill and let the Jawoyn people get on with their own lives? Why will he not let Aboriginal people negotiate directly with the mining companies? Is the Prime Minister seriously saying that Aboriginal people are incapable of doing so? Is he saying that they have to be protected by two central land councils which put political interests ahead of those of the Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago I met with a group of senior Aboriginal elders from central Australia who were, without exaggeration, desperate to negotiate directly with the mining companies but were denied that right by the power of the land councils. Empowering the Aboriginal people to do that will deliver more economic independence than any quick-fix job creation program one would care to mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&mdash;ATSIC&mdash;was set up with the aim of giving Aboriginal people a greater say in the decision making process. Yet, despite all of ATSIC's good intentions and devoted workers, the fact is that, in its current form, ATSIC has failed the Aboriginal people. It has failed them principally for two reasons: firstly, it remains predominantly a Canberra based operation, with 88c in every dollar still being decided by Canberra; and, secondly, it has an incredibly unwieldy structure of 60 regional councils and 850 regional councillors which has yet to produce the outcomes we were all promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of the present ATSIC structure, where is the accountability and where is the performance? Where are the benchmarks against which to measure the desired improvements in Aboriginal health, housing, education and employment opportunities? Where are the deadlines against which these performances can be assessed? The long term success of ATSIC is vitally dependent on accountability as to how the money is spent and upon how Aboriginal organisations and programs are monitored. We are still a long way short of attaining that success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Aboriginal programs run by DEET are in a mess. Successive Auditor-General's reports have highlighted a number of DEET inefficiencies&mdash;insufficient verification checks for applications, total lack of coordination with other departments, and no procedures to avoid duplication of benefits. A recent Auditor-General's report stated that auditing was not undertaken in relation to $80m of expenditure under Aboriginal education supplementary assistance because auditing had revealed that departmental records were not adequate to determine whether payments were accurate. In DEET's own words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sufficient documentary evidence was unable to be located to support the expenditure relating to this program.</PARA>
<PARA>There are countless other examples over the years of shoddy management and administration of programs for the Aboriginal people. Promises are made that things will change, but little ever happens. Not only is maladministration wasting taxpayers' money and building unnecessary duplication of services, but also, and most importantly, it is denying economic and social opportunities to the Aboriginal people&mdash;the very thing ATSIC set out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 1,300 to 1,400 organisations involved in the delivery of Aboriginal assistance. Even in the State of Victoria, for example, there are something like 174 organisations for just over 12,000 Aboriginal people; that is, one organisation for every 74 Aboriginal people! Clearly, things have got to change. The coalition's policy on the administration of ATSIC and Aboriginal affairs, like our support for the process of reconciliation, will continue to be squarely aimed at improving the well-being of the Aboriginal people. Our priority is to help them break out of welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people themselves will tell us that this dependency is slowly killing them and their culture. Politicians and bureaucrats should be listening more closely to what the Aboriginal people have to say. It is essential that we restore self-reliance and self-respect to the Aboriginal people. Those politicians who think solutions to Aboriginal problems are to be found simply by throwing more money at them are deluding themselves and selling the Aboriginal people short. Compassion should not be measured by the size of a government's chequebook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I see the social devastation and the Third World environment that many of our Aboriginal people are still living in, despite the amount of money spent, I feel saddened and ashamed. I feel sad for them, and ashamed that we in the wider community have failed to do it significantly better. Adopting the spirit of the recommendations of the report into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody gives us a real chance to finally start to get it right, not only in the way black and white Australians treat each other, but also in the way Aboriginal affairs are conducted in the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be releasing a major policy document on the administration of ATSIC and Aboriginal affairs at the end of this week. This will have as its centrepiece the decentralisation of ATSIC's decision making processes; a national funding model which will allocate funds to regions based on criteria, such as capacity to use the funds effectively and efficiently, regional need and a level of disadvantage; and a greater planning and budgetary role for the regional councils&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home State of Victoria over 46 per cent of the kids aged between 15 and 19 who want a job are unemployed. In South Australia, that other great Labor economic miracle, 45 per cent of young kids who want a job cannot find one. This figure for youth unemployment has to be put in context. It is seasonally adjusted and it reflects the very tight definition of unemployment used in labour force surveys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare that figure with that for unemployment at the height of the Great Depression, we get some idea of the magnitude of the problem facing us. In 1933 there was a census which surveyed the whole population. The definition of unemployment was very loose. It was one of self-identification; one was unemployed if one considered oneself to be so.

So the last time Australia faced a catastrophe like this young people  were  hit  just  as  hard  and in  the  same  way  as  the  rest  of the population. Today they are being hit three to four times as hard. I mentioned these comments on radio the other day and they were followed up by a person from the Australian Labor Party who  said that the Depression figures had stated the case. That is simply and basically wrong; if anything, they overstated the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could not be a greater example of the need to fundamentally rethink the way we do things in this country than the way that unemployed young people are being left out of the opportunity to work. The figure of 34.1 per cent understates the problem. It does not count people working even one hour a week. It does not count people who have given up. It does not count people doing six-week mickey mouse training courses at TAFE that will lead them nowhere and qualify them for nothing. It does not count kids who have stayed on at school or at uni because they cannot find a job. The number of students drawing Austudy has increased nearly 100 per cent in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just kids who have been left out of this. The figures for long term unemployment are also revealing. At the 1988 Labor Party conference in Hobart the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) chastised George Campbell for having 100,000 dead men around his neck&mdash;the result of those workers who had lost their jobs in the metal unions campaign of 1981-82. In the last two years, the number of unemployed in this country has gone up from 512,000 to 905,000&mdash;that is 393,000 dead men hanging around the neck of the Prime Minister. That is why there is such a stench from this Government&mdash;the stench of dead men and the stench of a decaying government; four George Campbells to make one Paul Keating.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long term unemployed have become a greater percentage of a rapidly rising figure. Two years ago, 125,000 people were unemployed for more than 12 months. That was under 23 per cent of the total. Today, 306,000 of those 905,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months; that is fully over one-third of the total number of long term unemployed people. So, of those 393,000 dead men around the Prime Minister's neck, 181,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months. These long term unemployed face a very bleak future. A paper by Bruce Chapman of the ANU, released earlier this year, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the Australian labour market augurs poorly for those already disadvantaged in the labour force of which there are and continue to be very many. Our estimates and projections imply strongly the number of long term unemployed will be by a large margin at unprecedented and still growing levels over the next two years. There is not now any chance of avoiding this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training admitted this at the National Press Club earlier this year and said that the Government had concerns in the area. Three months later we have seen nothing to address those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is a figure for long term unemployed that is well above 300,000 and goes well into the 1990s. What was the Minister's response to this? To try to compare it to the last recession. That hardly bears any scrutiny. In the last recession the number of long term unemployed peaked at around 190,000. Today, the number of long term unemployed has not yet peaked and is already over 300,000. The extra number of long term unemployed in the last two years is nearly equal to the entire number of long term unemployed 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment affects older Australians disproportionately. If one looks at the percentage of total unemployment in each age category for people who have been unemployed for more than 52 weeks, one sees that nearly two-thirds of those unemployed and aged between 60 and 64 have been unemployed for more than 12 months and nearly half those unemployed and aged between 45 and 60 have been unemployed for 12 months. Breadwinners, heads of households, are on the scrap heap of long term unemployment. Those figures are stark enough, but in the end they are just figures. What they do is translate themselves into the human face and the human tragedy that Australia is facing. They translate themselves into crime, suicide, homelessness and drugs. These are the things of which the Government can be proud! I will take them one by one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Chief Commissioner in Victoria, Kel Glare, said publicly that he feared that the young long term unemployed could become unemployable and form a disenfranchised underclass. In the past 10 years, the number of break-ins went up by 50 per cent&mdash;930 a day; serious assaults, 140 per cent; stealing, 69 per cent; and fraud, 110 per cent. Using court statistical data, it can be seen that youth violence has increased, youth gang activity has increased and female crime has increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a high rate of reporting of crime by victims compared to other countries, yet statistics are incredibly hard to come by. The ABS has a crimes unit which has not published anything. It has been functioning for two years and it is still arguing about definitions. This is not an area in which the Federal Government has no role. It can set standards and examples, try modelled approaches, evaluate, disseminate, initiate and lead. It has done none of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not tell us where it will supply some jobs in the cities of Australia. This is a very urbanised country and the Government does not have a policy for providing employment where it matters.

<PARA>In Question Time we now have Mr Baader-Meinhof sitting opposite us&mdash;the man who realised the problem in the early 1980s and has done nothing at all to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of suicide, particularly amongst young people, is a national tragedy. It does not gain much publicity, but each year in April the ABS releases figures on suicide. Suicide is the second largest killer of young men aged between 15 and 24 in Australia. This is an area of complete neglect by the Federal Government. In the last decade the number of young men committing suicide increased from 229 to 379 for the last year for which we have figures, 1990. That is nearly a two-thirds increase. When one looks at the results from 1991-92, with the circumstances that young people are facing and the pressures that they are under, one finds that they will increase further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, the honourable for member Tangney (Mr Shack), who held the shadow youth affairs portfolio for a number of years, wrote privately to successive Ministers responsible for youth affairs.

Successive Ministers offered platitudes; some did not even bother to respond to his letter; and nothing at all has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this is an area where the Federal Government also has to show some leadership. We have seen none to date. To not be alarmed by the high increasing suicide rate and to not make it a high priority of action is to ignore one of the biggest problems facing our young people today. This Government has made no attempt to protect Australia's vulnerable children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of youth homelessness, groups like the Salvation Army and the Sydney City Mission are seeing unprecedented demands for services. The Sydney City Mission estimates that every night 10,000 kids are on the streets, of whom 10 per cent might be hard-core homeless youths. We have no real figures on this; we do not know. We can only guess that 25,000 young kids around Australia are homeless at any one time. We are in a worse position now than when Brian Burdekin released his report two years ago. What has the Government's response to this been? We have had the wonderful situation in which the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), when she was in Rio, was being reported back here as saying that Australia had hardly any street kids. I can tell the Minister that when she talks to people in Canberra she might find out that kids actually sleep in the bus station just down from her office. If she cares to have a look, she might get a surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that it is well accepted around the world that with youth unemployment and youth alienation drug use will rise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each new crisis in this country&mdash;the crises of employment, youth unemployment, suicide, crime, homelessness and drugs&mdash;what has been the Government's response? It has been twofold. First, it has been an attempt to shoot the messenger, and, secondly, it has been to say we will talk about it. Big deal! I want to take those points one by one, for they show the fundamental intellectual dishonesty and bankruptcy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the attempt to redefine the nature of the problem in a way that has never been done anywhere in the world. I sat here and listened to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) attempt to do it again in Question Time. To try to talk about youth unemployment in terms of the entire youth population simply defies imagination. With so many young kids unemployed, given up, on the streets, in mickey mouse training schemes or staying at school or university when they would rather have a job, it is fooling nobody to suggest that 9 per cent of young people cannot find work. Everyone out in the real world knows that that is not the situation. The Government is simply out of touch with the real world. Worse, it shows something much deeper. Before one can address a problem, one has to face up to it. This Government is simply not prepared to face up to the consequences of its own actions. If it is not honest with itself, there is no possibility of beginning to tackle the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is to say, `Well, we are going to talk about it'. I say to that, whacko! We have had summits, talks and promises up to our ears. This was put to me very graphically just last week when I was talking to a young person. I was saying how I had sat in this House and heard the Prime Minister say that he was going to bring home the bacon. She looked me straight in the eye and said, `The only bacon Mr Keating has given us is the pig's anus'. She actually used more colourful words, but I do not think they would be parliamentary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking for the cause of the trouble we do not have to look very far beyond the Labor Party front bench. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), when he was Vice-President of the ACTU, presented the ACTU's view to the Hancock committee in 1984. He emphatically denied any connection between youth unemployment and youth award wages. The honourable member for Hotham, as Secretary of the Storeman and Packers Union, led the union in pursuing a vigorous policy of eliminating all forms of junior rates and awards. The honourable member for Hotham, now a senior Cabinet Minister, has knowingly, consciously and deliberately followed a policy over many years of destroying as many youth award wages as he could. Young people are now reaping the benefits of these enlightened policies!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was accused today by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) of having no policies to deal with this problem. We certainly do. This is the same Minister I heard some four weeks ago accusing us of having policies coming out of our ears. What the Government could do is fundamentally rethink the way it does business in this country. It could scrap the superannuation guarantee levy and save 80,000 jobs at a minimum. It could abolish payroll tax and create 200,000 jobs straightaway. It could reduce immigration. We have made commitments to do all of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could have a youth wage. I remember that when I was first standing for Parliament the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who was then Leader of the Opposition, was talking about a youth wage, and he was ridiculed by the other side of the House. As little as four months ago, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in his shrill, high-pitched voice, was talking about Austrain enslaving young people. Austrain will give young people a job. If the Government put that sort of reform in place, it could offer them some hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in talking to young people, it is very obvious what they want. They want jobs, to be listened to and to have their say in what affects them. We have shown by our proposals for 4 July that we are going to listen to young people. At least we might show that we can offer them some hope. The current Government is intellectually unable to come to grips with the problem and practically unable to offer them anything but more of the same. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anybody in this chamber disputes the seriousness of the problem of youth unemployment and unemployment generally. But it is important that we have an accurate conception of the significance of the statistics. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), made a number of comments which need to be responded to. He made a spurious comparison with the period of the Depression. The fact is that during the Depression we had participation rates in education and training by people in the 15 to 19 years age group which were minuscule compared with today's rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall begin by making some comments about the youth labour market specifically. Over the last 10 years some very significant structural changes have taken place in the youth labour market&mdash;changes that have to be addressed and taken into account if we are to develop credible solutions to the problem of youth unemployment. The first major structural change that has occurred is a dramatic increase in rates of participation in education and training. School retention rates, that is, the proportion of young people who complete a full 12 years of school, have virtually doubled from about 36 per cent in 1982 to, we think, about 75 per cent this year. That is a dramatic increase. We have also seen dramatic increases in the numbers enrolled in universities. Back in 1987 there were some 370,000 domestic students; this year there are about 530,000 in our higher education system. That represents a dramatic increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has been a major change in the level of aspiration of young people to education and training. The previous speaker sought to imply that that was predominantly a response to adverse labour market circumstances. That is certainly not true. Since 1984 the Department of Employment, Education and Training has every two years undertaken a comprehensive survey of youth attitudes. There is no doubt that we have seen a massive intergenerational change in the value and significance that young people put on further education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably the case that in the period of the recession there has been an additional kick along in those education participation figures, but the underlying change is undoubted and of massive proportions. To say that all that change is just a case of people retreating from an adverse labour market situation is just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to argue about these sorts of historical comparisons, we obviously have to take into account the very strong growth in the participation rate in the labour market that has occurred over the last few years. If we were to compute an unemployment figure based on a participation rate comparable with that in which we took office, we would again see a much lower figure. We can argue endlessly about these statistics. What the Government does not argue about is the seriousness of the situation and the need to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major structural change in the youth labour market has been that dramatic increase in participation in education and training. That has been focused predominantly in the school retention figures and in the higher education and university participation figures. There has not been a similar transformation in young people's participation in TAFE and technical and vocational education. In that area we have seen either stagnation or actual decline. We think that is a very significant part of the problem that we now face in the structure of our education and training system, and one that is related to the problem of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second big structural change in the youth labour market in recent years has been the drying up, because of structural and technological change, of a whole range of entry level jobs that young people would previously have been able to take by way of their first point of entry into the labour market. We are talking about unskilled jobs, such as operatives, couriers and telephonists. There is a whole range of those jobs which, because of that underlying structural technological change, have literally disappeared and will not return. That point has been emphasised by Richard Sweet from the New South Wales TAFE system, who has done a study of the youth labour market going back over the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the two changes that we have seen&mdash;dramatic increases in education and training participation but with a weak area in the TAFE system, and structural change in the youth labour market with many jobs disappearing permanently. This increases the tendency for employers to try to manage their labour supply more optimally from their point of view&mdash;that is, by making more extensive use of part time and casual workers rather than full time workers. So the supply of those full time, unskilled jobs previously open to young people has dramatically reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That opens up the question of how to address the situation. The Opposition basically proposes to do a number of things. I will go through a few that are relevant to the youth labour market. In my area of responsibility the Opposition says that it will get rid of the CES network. In the CES network there are youth access centres. There are now some 140 of those and they have been unusually successful in providing a congenial environment and point of contact with young people. The youth access centres have been rigorously evaluated by an independent consultant and found to be highly effective and extremely well regarded by young people. They have been invaluable in providing assistance and support for young people seeking to enter the labour market. The Opposition would get rid of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the question of entry level training, the Government is talking about a substantial broadening of opportunities for young people to enter structured training and work. That is absolutely necessary. As I said, those unskilled entry level jobs have dried up. We must have a dramatically revamped system of entry level training. At the moment about half the people who leave school and do not go to university participate in no structured education and training opportunity whatsoever. We have to change that. We have taken on board the recommendations of the Carmichael review and are aiming to develop a much broader and comprehensive system of entry level training and work experience. That will supersede and encompass the existing apprenticeship and traineeship system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition talks about a youth wage. What it is on about is cutting youth wages for young people so they would be paid less for doing essentially the same work. What we are talking about is a training wage. It is important to use that terminology rather than a `youth wage' because we are saying that a training wage should recognise the fact that somebody just entering the labour force who is inexperienced and unskilled will need to spend part of his or her time undertaking structured training and skill acquisition. A lot of that will have to take place off the job. We are saying that there needs to be a remuneration system which recognises that. We are saying that there needs to be a move towards a competency based training system so that, instead of being time related, the recognition of people's skills will be based on acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills and the ability to apply them. Once one is a fully competent worker, irrespective of one's wage, one would be paid the full award wage. That is a very different concept from simply paying an age related wage. What we are talking about is a training wage where somebody, irrespective of age&mdash;a fully competent worker&mdash;would be paid the going award rate. That is a fundamental distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major and related element in the Government's strategy&mdash;as well as introducing a broader entry level training system so that we would have a system that would provide entrance to a far broader spectrum of occupations in the existing apprenticeship and traineeship system, which has played a useful historical role although a large proportion of young people have been ill-served by it, particularly young women who have a very small number of opportunities through the apprenticeship system&mdash;is that we need a new entry level training system and to substantially boost spending on the technical and further education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government has committed itself to a substantial boost in resources and funding for the technical and further education system. We have said that we will put an extra $720m into that system over the next three years. By contrast, the Opposition has a policy in Fightback that implies an actual cut in the number of technical and further education places. It says that it will make a one-off increase of $75m over and above the 1991-92 budgetary figures for technical and further education. Since the last Budget this Government has increased the level of funding by $100m, compared with the $75m which the Opposition suggests, and we have said that we will boost that substantially so that, as I have said, over the next three years there will be a $750m increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition's policies imply is a significant cut in technical and further education places in a situation where there is massive unmet demand for TAFE places throughout the country. We need to have that strengthening of the vocational training system if we are to go about this reform of entry level training to which I referred earlier. The two things go integrally together. The Opposition's policies would not provide the resources that are necessary for that. Young people would be short-changed and would not be provided with the opportunities that are needed. For the Opposition to talk about what it will do and what its policies will mean is sheer hypocrisy. Its policies will mean a considerable darkening of opportunities for young people in the labour market. It has failed to recognise the underlying structural changes that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the point that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made&mdash;that is, we have to get an accurate conception of the magnitude of the problem. The Opposition keeps talking as if one in three young people in this country in the 15 to 19 age group are wandering around looking for work and unable to find it. That is simply untrue. We have a very serious youth unemployment problem. The proportion of people in the 15 to 19 age group who are unemployed and seeking full time work is slightly under 10 per cent. That is bad enough in itself and is a problem which we must address. We are committed to addressing it. But Opposition members go round uttering those figures when they know perfectly well that they are untrue. The argument has been pointed out any number of times and they know their claims are false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spoken on youth unemployment, I now wish to make a few comments on the larger unemployment problem. Of course, we are not Robinson Crusoe in experiencing a recession at the present time. Just about the entire English-speaking world is experiencing severe economic problems. The United States has had a prolonged recession from which it is finding it very difficult to recover. It is starting to see early signs of recovery. The UK has had a two-year recession. New Zealand significantly, since it introduced a policy package with many elements of similarity to the Opposition's Fightback policy&mdash;that is to say, the large scale substitution of consumption tax for income tax&mdash;has had very severe economic problems and has gone from being a relatively low unemployment country to one with a higher rate of unemployment than Australia. That has been the effect of implementing the policy mix that the Opposition advocates&mdash;that is, a substantial and dramatic increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that goes to confirm are the results of the Opposition's own econometric modelling of the effect of its policy mix. Dr Murphy, who did much of the work for the Fightback policy, explicitly modelled the effect of a substantial substitution of consumption tax for income tax. What was the result of that? It showed that, on the optimistic assumption that one could quarantine the price effects from the wages system, there would be a 0.2 per cent increase in unemployment and a 0.2 per cent decrease in GDP. On the less optimistic assumption, but the more realistic one, the Opposition would be unable to quarantine the price effects of the GST from the wages system and it was predicted that there would be a 4 per cent diminution in GDP over and above what it would have been. The centrepiece of the Opposition's strategy to deal with our economic future and solve unemployment would be directly counterproductive in terms of jobs and unemployment, even according to the econometric modelling done by the person who had a substantial input into the development of the Opposition's policy package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about unemployment it is not good enough to just lament the situation. We all lament the situation and recognise the central importance of preventing the entrenchment of long term unemployment. But the Opposition's policies would be directly counterproductive. Furthermore, the Fightback policy commits the Opposition to slashing a whole range of labour market programs which have been demonstrably effective in improving the prospects of long term unemployed people in particular. It talks about slashing by more than half expenditure on labour market programs over and above what this Government has committed itself to. We know, and the studies on the effectiveness of these policies have shown, that they are effective particularly for the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the Opposition would also get rid of the CES system, which has been revamped in recent years to focus on much more intensive assistance for the long term unemployed person and the disadvantaged job seeker. It would also get rid of the youth access centres. It would get rid of the labour market programs. It would slash TAFE training places. The Opposition has no conception of entry level training and how that might work, which is a total contrast to this Government's view that it is central to a coherent and effective policy to address the problem of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will do nothing to solve unemployment. It will kick these people off income support after nine months and force them to go through a very rigorous process to get special benefits. It assumes in its own figuring that some 50,000 people will be knocked off it. Opposition members come in here and complain about crime.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have seen the cost of artificially pumping up the economy with borrowed money&mdash;largely foreigners' money. Over recent years the Government has told us repeatedly that it has managed to create 1.5 million new jobs. But it has done so at the price of a blow-out in foreign debt. Now the chickens have come home to roost. Our unemployment and declining living standards are obvious testimony to that reality. Worse is the legacy that we are leaving to the next generation of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had years of high interest rates&mdash;what the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once referred to as the `blunt instrument' of monetary policy. Honourable members should remember that, in one period of 18 months in which interest rates were constantly over 20 per cent, the Government failed to rein in our trading deficit but succeeded in perpetrating irreparable damage to countless businesses across this country&mdash;that is, in effect, countless employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just that record numbers of employers have gone under, with all the high-flying bankruptcy figures amongst the small business sector; in addition, countless thousands have been so badly hurt that they cannot recover quickly, if at all, and countless additional thousands more have lost their confidence. They no longer have any confidence in this Government or its commitment to investment and to creating an environment that is conducive to economic expansion and solid economic growth. It needs to be understood, as I fear it is by far too few people in this place, that confidence is the key to investment, which in turn is the key to growth and jobs. Countless employers will not be in a hurry to expand, to take on workers or to give young Australians a go. They have had their fingers burnt, well and truly, too many times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very sad day when this Parliament is subjected to two such disappointing contributions from the Opposition on the crucial issue of unacceptable employment levels in this nation and, indeed, the world. It is disappointing because the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) are two of the more able members on the Opposition side, yet they offer as solutions the abolition of payroll tax, the abolition of the superannuation levy and the abolition of the training guarantee levy and say that all our problems will be solved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a fleeting moment I thought that in this place today the level of debate by the Opposition might be lifted. The Opposition's record on unemployment is practically non-existent, and many on that side of the House know that to be true. Concern and care for the unemployed? They have to be joking. Analysis of unemployment appears to be beyond the intellectual capacity of honourable members opposite. They describe what happens, but they cannot ask the intellectual question: why? They continue to attack a problem by looking out the back window. They continue to believe that they can resurrect an industrial world. They want continually to drag this nation backwards to an industrial world that will be dead before they are. They have learnt little, if anything, in the last 40 years. Forward thinking, in their terms, is an acceptance of the status quo. They have no aims for glory and no acceptance of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to the Opposition's contribution, I at least would like to look out the front window in debating this matter of public importance. Throughout the industrialised world, whether we compare the OECD or the EC, as well as Australia, there appears to be chronic and endemic unemployment of around 10 per cent. It is an international problem that will be greatly exacerbated in the next 12 years, when one billion people will be added to this planet. The Opposition appears to believe that reliance upon conventional approaches to economic growth&mdash;that is, huge capital outlays, high energy consumption, the production of enormous amounts of pollution&mdash;will deliver one of the most important products of any economy; that is, enough jobs. It has not worked in the past 40 years, and there is little likelihood that it will work in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simple examination of the 1950s tells us that the gap between various nations' GNP and employment was on a par, or at least at a marginal level. In the early 1990s there is a huge gap in all OECD countries. Where have those jobs gone? An analysis of employment from the 1960s is pretty enlightening. In the OECD, industrial employment declined from 35 to 30 per cent; agricultural employment fell from 22 per cent to 8 per cent; service jobs increased from 43 per cent to 62 per cent. But as we all know, or ought to know, we still have a human surplus in labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditional industries such as textiles, iron and steel and metals processing are declining in employment, while electronics, telecommunications and biotechnology certainly are gaining, but not to the extent previously thought, to take up the labour surplus. We know that the micro-electronic industry has spawned whole new industries, but it has also frighteningly reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Traditional economic growth as proposed by those opposite no longer is always accompanied by a commensurate increase in the number of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the industrialised world we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour, which is in surplus. If we take the United States as an example of a large economy, we certainly know what has occurred. Since the 1950s the output of the manufacturing sector has tripled, the amount of energy used has also tripled and the quantity of capital has quadrupled; but&mdash;and this is the real catch&mdash;the amount of input labour has increased by only a third. The worst polluting industries&mdash;oil and coal, chemicals, primary metals and paper&mdash;account for about 80 per cent of pollution in the United States. They consume about 20 per cent of energy and they provide about 3 per cent of the jobs. In the 1980s in the USA, 25 per cent of refining jobs disappeared and, despite rising production, coalmining jobs fell by 33 per cent. The patterns and trends in Europe and Australia are the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though there is a huge shift from manufacturing to services, it cannot replace the manufacturing sector. Obviously demand for manufactured products will continue. Unless we change the fundamental means of production&mdash;I thought the honourable member for Chisholm was going to get onto this&mdash;industrial pollution and looking out the back window by conservative politicians will cripple not only the people but the environment as well. The answer certainly is political action and vision, something not found on the conservative side of politics. For centuries on this planet the economy has ruled at the expense of ecology. Yet the origin of both `economy' and `ecology' is the Greek `oikos'. Some people in the environment movement suggest that we must sacrifice human well-being&mdash;that is, full employment&mdash;to the altar of environmental purity. Both environmental and economic health are in fact interdependent, something that people on the other side do not seem to have woken up to. The choice for full employment is not between the environment and jobs. It is neither or it is both, and I strongly suggest to this House that it is both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A coalition obviously needs to be forged between the labour and environmental movements in the world, and conservative politicians need to be kept continually in opposition. We cannot continue to have an economy depending forever on the depletion of natural resources, degrading of air and water, and rendering of huge areas of land unfit for habitation. That is why the MFP, of which the Opposition is so critical&mdash;a Labor initiative in my own electorate of Port Adelaide&mdash;is so important. It will help to point the way to the future of employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the place of the worst environmental offenders, which include the oil, coal, chemical, paper and motor vehicle industries, will come new industries, but they certainly would not come to the light of day if this current Opposition happened to fall into power. Even without environmental policies, many jobs in these industries are disappearing due to increased automation. Total pollution abatement expenditure in the OECD is now worth $200 billion annually. It created five million jobs directly and indirectly in western Europe and the USA. There has to be a move away from the massive combustion of oil and coal, and we are going to be forced to use energy more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question is: where do those jobs come from? I do not pretend I know all the answers, but certainly the following examples point to where those opportunities will lie. Take energy, for example. If we want to generate 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity, in a nuclear plant we will employ 100 workers, in a coal-fired plant we will employ 116, in a solar thermal facility we will employ 250 and on a wind farm we will employ 550. The challenge is to build renewable energy systems at a lower or equivalent capital cost to conventional systems; that is, deliberately to divert spending to areas that are labour intensive&mdash;not dead-end, untrained labour, but trained labour intensive employment. Energy efficient housing produces gains in employment&mdash;up to 80 jobs for $1m of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at infrastructure spending, which we have noted in One Nation is so absent from Fightback. An environmentally sustainable economy will require the reversal of a still rising dependence upon cars and trucks. For this to happen, as we have said in the One Nation statement, rail-based transport must be given priority. Some wrongly suggest that this is a return to the practices of 80 years ago, but today there are opportunities for technological and other improvements. I looked at some German figures, which were interesting in terms of employment opportunities. The spending of a billion deutschmarks on highway construction in fact creates the fewest jobs; rail increases by 22,000 jobs; light rail by even more&mdash;23,000; and road 14,000 and probably fewer than 10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The skills of engineering, concrete pouring and all of the above are pretty much the same. The transition, or greater emphasis, is pretty straightforward. Recycling is another example. Alcoa in the United States estimates that there are 30,000 people in the USA involved in the recycling of aluminium, equal to twice the level of employment in the primary aluminium industry. That is based on a very low rate of recycling. Boosting it to 75 per cent would yield 375,000 jobs in the USA. To process a million tonnes of garbage in an incinerator might need 400 jobs, landfill might need 200 jobs, but in a recycling facility up to 2,000 jobs might be needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the fifty-fifth general report of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the House. The Committee's fifty-fifth general report covers the activities of the Committee during 1991. The Committee presented 12 reports during the year on a range of public works, such as defence facilities; the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan; CSIRO laboratories in Melbourne; and houses for the Defence Force in Western Australia. The estimated cost of the proposals on which the Committee reported during 1991 was $231m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee met on 53 occasions during the year to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, to consider reports and be briefed by departmental officials. As in past years, the report raises a number of matters of concern which emerged during the year. I will briefly mention a few of them. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the construction of a shell filling facility at St Marys Munitions Filling Factory in New South Wales. Honourable members will recall that this facility, estimated to cost $7.7m, was referred to the Committee in October 1988. Not long after that, in December, the Committee held a public hearing into the proposal at which officials from the Department of Defence assured the Committee, firstly, that the facility was required; secondly, that despite urban encroachment, the factory would remain at its location; and, thirdly, the merits of the proposed work had been assessed as essential even though the establishment of Australian Defence Industries was in the offing. Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Parliament that the work should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was amazed when it was advised by the Department of Defence in May last year that the shell filling facility, which had meanwhile been completed, was no longer required. Apparently during 1990 the newly formed ADI had carried out an extensive review of its operations to rationalise and improve efficiency, which resulted in the St Marys Munitions Filling Factory being no longer required. The Committee believes the project was a debacle of monumental proportions. The new shell filling factory was proceeded with in a climate of uncertainty based on erroneous assumptions. The Committee accordingly gives notice that all public works referred to it for consideration, be they for the Department of Defence, or for other departments or agencies, will be required to withstand the `St Marys test'&mdash;that is, the need, justification, benefits and public value of public works will need to be rigorously tested by the management of departments and agencies before they are referred to the Committee. This incident also demonstrates the risks involved in departments proceeding with the provision of major facilities during a period of organisational establishment or reorganisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second matter for concern involved another incident involving the Department of Defence. It relates to the refurbishment of Endeavour House, a former migrant hostel, located in Coogee, New South Wales, to provide accommodation for junior sailors in the Sydney area. The scope of the work was originally costed at $5.8m in August 1988 but, due to a litany of what can charitably be described as unfortunate circumstances, by January 1991 the cost had blown out to more than $7.2m. Following a briefing by Defence officials, the Committee concluded that some effort was made to adjust components of the project to keep it below the $6m reference limit; the scope of the project was poorly defined; and that inadequate administrative procedures in Defence had caused a project estimated to cost at least $7.385m from being referred to the Committee, contrary to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) subsequently advised the Committee that the Secretary to the Department had been asked to review administrative processes for the control of both capital works and repairs and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third matter of concern relates to the approval of designs by non-Commonwealth authorities. During 1991, Australian Construction Services, formerly the Department of Housing and Construction, ceased to be the Commonwealth's design and construction authority. Departments and agencies are now free to select design and construction agents from the private sector. The Committee believes that in this environment there is scope for the rigorous oversight of the design of major works, formerly carried out by Australian Construction Services, to be diminished. In the past, Australian Construction Services was responsible for the application of planning and design principles with some measure of consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one hearing, a witness submitted that there now appears to be generally no formal process by which the community can be assured that Commonwealth building work will conform to current community standards. Buildings and facilities planned and constructed for the private sector are subject to a number of formal processes, such as applying for building approval, the checking of plans, inspections and the issuing of certificates of occupancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst under the principle of the shield of the Crown the Commonwealth is not required to seek formal approvals and pay fees, now that departments and government business enterprises are regarding buildings and facilities as saleable assets, for the full value of these assets to be realised they would need to formally comply with local government and State government regulations. The Committee accepts that there are constitutional issues involved and will shortly write to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the provision of work-based child-care facilities continued to be pursued by the Committee. In a number of instances, departments and agencies demonstrated that they are aware of their responsibilities to their employees. It was particularly gratifying to see a report during the year from the Australian Taxation Office, one of the largest Public Service employers, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO sees the provision of child care facilities for employees as good human resource management practices, enabling optimal returns on the Office's investment in recruiting, developing and retaining staff.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continues to focus attention on the energy efficiency of buildings and reiterates that sponsoring departments and design and construction authorities must be more energy conscious in the design of buildings. The Committee therefore gives notice that in future more details of energy conservation principles and measures will be given close examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to my hard-working colleagues&mdash;the vice-chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), as well as our parliamentary colleagues from the Senate&mdash;Senator Burns, Senator Calvert and Senator Devereux. I think members of the Committee will join me in thanking the dedicated secretariat staff for their professional approach to the numerous challenges faced by the Committee during the year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Macquarie)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) when tabling the Public Works Committee report. He referred to the new shell filling facility, work on which began a couple of years ago and which was completed last year, at St Marys, which is a small part of my electorate. In fact, the compound that takes in the St Marys ammunition factory, as it used to be called, is part of my electorate. Last year, I drew to the attention of the House the tremendous shock that many people received with the knowledge that this $8m factory at St Marys that was built for the filling of shells may never be opened. In addition to that $8m, of course, there was another $2m or so in consultancy fees. So in excess of $10m was spent building a state-of-the-art shell filling factory at St Marys which may never be opened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse the comments by the honourable member for Throsby, who, I must say, has made no apology to anybody for what seems to be a tremendous debacle. I feel that taxpayers ought to be demanding an explanation as to why this huge amount of their money was spent at St Marys on a massive structure which cannot be used; it may be that it cannot be used for anything at all in that area. All it will be able to provide in the future&mdash;if the Government proceeds with the closing down of the factory and a housing settlement is established there&mdash;is a lot of work for a number of bulldozers and men to remove it. It is a reinforced structure; it has huge mounds of shock-deadening earth around it, gravel and so on. It will be a tremendous job to shift it. So the removal is going to cost a huge amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was important for me to comment on this facility, because I was very concerned about the huge expenditure. I am concerned that the munitions factory at St Marys is closing. It is a very efficient factory. The safety standards that exist there are second to none anywhere in Australia and even in the world. Over 400 people work there. The Australian Defence Industries hierarchy says that they are going to be offered positions elsewhere, but of course these people all live in the area, they are settled in the area and they do not want to move. There is really no need for them to move. This $10m state-of-the-art structure is seemingly going to be bulldozed. Somebody will need to do a lot of explaining about the monumental decision that has been made. I ask that this matter be pursued, particularly with regard to whether the ADI is prepared to reconsider and leave the factory at St Marys, where it is operating very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that in terms of cleaning up the area the cost to the taxpayer is going to be huge. One wonders at the wisdom of coming to this decision. I commend the honourable member for Throsby for his forthright comments and also for his declaration of the St Marys requirements, or the new protocol, that will be necessary before any government department seeks the approval of the Public Works Committee in terms of any new structure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak briefly to these amendments. They arise from some undertakings given by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) when this matter was previously debated to examine proposals whereby, under the scheme that was put in place for registering migration agents and the requirement of the payment of a substantial fee of $1,000 for registration, there were particular people who might be seeking as agents to render migration assistance but in a very limited number of cases, perhaps two or three a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would happen particularly in rural towns, where the solicitor can very often be the person most literate and able to assist in filling out forms, but not necessarily seeking to hold himself out as a migration agent offering a comprehensive range of services which could be available on a regular basis such as to necessitate payment of a large registration fee. Of course, in the case of professionals such as accountants and lawyers, this would be in addition to any professional fee they might otherwise have to pay. It was therefore appropriate for the Government to consider this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Government's reconsideration and the amendment that has been brought forward, which deals specifically with providing the opportunity for registration of an applicant proposing to give immigration assistance&mdash;that is, offering advice and filling out migration forms and the like&mdash;in no more than five migration cases, and that can include a number of applications in the case of family units. In that situation of handling up to five cases there would be a lesser fee of $50 and a fee of $100 in the case of a corporation, partnership or principal registered agent. That seems to me to be an eminently sensible and appropriate response to the complaints that were made by representatives of the legal profession, in particular the Law Council of Australia, the Victorian Law Institute and the Law Society of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the amendments also provide for people who are members of a diplomatic mission, a consular post or the office of an international organisation to be able to give immigration assistance in their capacity as such officers. I can understand that such people might often be called upon to offer some advice in relation to filling out forms and the like and that they should not be subjected to possible criminal offences through doing that. However, in relation to people who may hold consular positions in some of our major cities but who are not officers brought in from the diplomatic corps of a particular country&mdash;they may be well-known members of the local community with other roles, professional or otherwise&mdash;I would not like to think that getting a consular posting would provide a mechanism for circumventing the requirement for people to register as agents, particularly when they are offering paid immigration assistance. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) can clarify that these arrangements would not enable such consular, diplomatic or other personnel to charge fees. We might need to look at that question again if they were charging fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, I indicate that, after this legislation was first in the House and then dealt with by the Senate, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales was in touch with both the Minister and me, concerned that there were a number of serious complaints made against some members of the legal profession about its self-regulatory approach. The criticism offered by the Minister was that they had `not responded with adequate timeliness or vigour'. Mr Marsden states in his letter to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you had been in possession of any information such as might substantiate this allegation of serious complaints against members of the legal profession, it would have been appropriate for you to have supplied the relevant legal professional bodies with that information. As the president of the largest legal professional organisation in Australia, I am bound to point out to you that I have never received from you any such information at all.</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that that is during his term of office&mdash;which I might add is only this year. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any suggestion that the self-regulatory mechanisms of the Law Society of New South Wales do not respond with adequate timeliness or vigour to appropriate information of this kind is most strongly resisted. It is a defamatory allegation which we, as a profession, deeply resent. We take real and justifiable pride in the efficiency and diligence which characterise these mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unsubstantiated suggestion that there is a need for some progress to be made by the legal profession in strengthening its self-regulatory mechanisms was subsequently repeated in your speech when you want to assert that, while there will be an evaluation after two years of the relevant registration arrangements, one of the issues that will be considered in such evaluation is whether or not any such `progress' has been made.</PARA>
<PARA>The President, Mr Marsden, invited the Minister to provide him with relevant information to substantiate the remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that these comments have been made from time to time about members of the legal profession. I would certainly like to think that, where complaints had been made to the Department about the conduct of members of the legal profession, when those complaints had been investigated they were followed up by the Department and complaints made to the professional bodies. I have always assumed that that was done. If it has not been done, it is unfortunate that we are making these suggestions against the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will have the Minister clarify this matter&mdash;that the appropriate cases that were brought to the attention of the Law Society and the absence of appropriate disciplinary action can be drawn to Mr Marsden's attention and clarified&mdash;so that there is not this contest between the profession and the Government. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would appreciate the important reason why, in terms of the credibility of this legislation, that ought to be done. I would seek his assurance in relation to that matter. </PARA>

<PARA>The two amendments under discussion have the effect of reducing the time for the prima facie stage of a dumping inquiry from 25 days to five days. Those amendments are not acceptable because, in the first place, five days leaves insufficient time to give effect to the requirements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anti-dumping code and the requirements of Australia's domestic legislation relating to the consideration of application for anti-dumping relief prior to the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation. </PARA>

In the third place, a five-day prima facie period effectively nullifies the reforms contained in the Bill which enable the Australian Customs Service to supplement an application for dumping relief with other relevant information by leaving the ACS with insufficient time to obtain and properly weigh such other information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to stop the flow of what is turning out to be a most productive afternoon, but the Opposition has some very great difficulties with the amendments that have been sent back to us by the Senate to apply to part 2 of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill in relation to the Air Navigation Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy Chairman, you may remember that when this Bill originally came into the House of Representatives, in a bipartisan way both the Government and the Opposition supported it. We supported the Bill because all that was involved was that certain offences committed under the Air Navigation Act were taken out of regulations and physically put into the Bill. The legislation went over to the Senate and was under a guillotine when the Australian Democrats put up absolutely preposterous amendments&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is nothing new for the Democrats. Unfortunately, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) supported the amendments because, he said, the concerns of the Democrats were reasonably based. He offered no other reason because of the time constraint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a relatively minor matter, but what have we ended up with? It is really quite startling. For example, international aircraft that do not land at designated international airports commit an offence. At the moment the penalty that is imposed by the Government is a fine of $5,000 and that imposed on an individual is two years gaol. We found that, for some unknown reason, the Democrats moved an amendment that the penalty be increased to $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 concerns the licensing of international airlines. The legislation provides for a $100,000 fine if unlicensed aircraft operate scheduled international air services over, into or out of Australian territory. The Democrats increased the fine to $500,000 and the gaol penalty to seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In clause 7 of the Bill, relating to non-scheduled international flights by Australian aircraft, the fine was set at $5,000. Amendment No. 4 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol for an individual. Clause 8 of the Bill concerns non-scheduled flights by aircraft with the nationality of a contract state and sets the fine for contravention of the legislation at $5,000. Amendment No. 5 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol. Clause 9 concerns non-scheduled flights by aircraft not possessing the nationality of a contracting state; the fine for contravention of the provision was $5,000; amendment No. 6 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol. Amendment No. 7 increases the penalty for failing to get permission for international flights from $5,000 to $100,000, or two years gaol for the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 8&mdash;I think this was the hang-up of the Democrats&mdash;related to conditions for the carriage of munitions that had not been declared. The fine went from $5,000 to $100,000 or, in the case of an individual, seven years gaol. It is quite fascinating to look at the statements of the Democrats spokesperson, Senator Powell, justifying the increases. She said that the Democrats were seeking to bring penalties to a better and more appropriate standard. She thought the punishment must fit the crime. She regarded munitions trafficking as very serious. As I say, the Minister&mdash;I suppose because of the pressure of the guillotine&mdash;just said, `It all sounds reasonable to me. We will let it through'. The guillotine was placed on what was really a non-contentious Bill. It has resulted in these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real difficulty I have with them is that I think we have started to go absolutely stark raving mad in terms of the administration of aviation in this country. It would appear that there are elements within the Parliament who think that everybody who flies an aircraft is an absolute ratbag or, at worst, a criminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that aviation is a very specialised area. Most people who fly aircraft in Australia&mdash;there are 8,500 private aircraft; we are talking about only 500 commercial aircraft&mdash;are very responsible people. Do the Democrats really think that the people who fly aircraft will breach some of the awards on purpose? Of course, they will not. It has been decided that what could well be an inadvertent breach of a regulation which is in the Act now becomes a major criminal offence. One really wonders what it is all about and whether some of the penalties that we are putting on the aviation industry are nothing more than a revenue raising exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I think that the aviation industry is finding it increasingly difficult to bear some of the penalties and restrictions that have been floating around. I suppose it is fair enough for the Democrats to have this hang-up about munitions. But in an international sense we look particularly foolish. If people are going to go into gun running or smuggling, do we honestly believe that a fine of this magnitude will stop them? We are talking about big international business and big international corruption; I do not think these measures will do a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, when the Bill was originally in this place, the Government thought it was fair enough to maintain those penalties in the Act, as did the Opposition. Everybody was happy. Then it went to the other place and the Democrats put the cat amongst the pigeons and the whole place went berserk. I think it would do us the world of good if we opposed these amendments, as we should, because they really do make us something of a laughing stock in terms of the international marketplace. As I have said, the pressures that have been put on the aviation industry, which comprises really most responsible people, are just getting too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats may be really worried about some of the people who operate in aviation. But I checked with the Department this afternoon and was told that it is unlikely that there would be even 20 ratbags in the whole of the aviation industry in Australia; I would be surprised if there were even half that number. It seems to me that we are letting the Democrats get away with murder on this, and it is my intention to oppose this most vigorously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not notorious for agreeing with the Australian Democrats particularly often; and in some ways I am not their favourite person. But on this occasion the Government has agreed to support, and will support here, the amendments that were made in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some of the points that were made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) seem plausible, I will point out two or three things. In the first place, he referred to the carriage of munitions and gun running. It is the case that the fines proposed and the amendments are consistent with the Crimes (Aircraft) Act provisions so far as the carriage of dangerous goods is concerned. So there is consistency there and I think the amendments are defensible on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second place, the penalties to which the honourable member for Fadden referred may seem draconian when one looks at the maximum penalties, but they are maximum penalties and the courts have the discretion to impose lesser penalties, including fines rather than imprisonment, for those offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third place, while the figure of $100,000 for corporations may seem large, it is the case that typically in legislation fines that are provided for corporations are about five times those suggested for individuals. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Speaking more generally, I do think that the community is right to express its opposition to offences of this kind through penalties, which I believe would constitute a deterrent to some of these activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The need to consider these amendments is entirely due, once again, to the lack of ordinary forethought given by the Government to its legislation in general and to its tax legislation in particular. I suspect that, without knowing the details, most of the amendments being discussed here this afternoon are also attributable to this lack of legislative competence, which we see displayed by the Government time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall that we discussed this Bill under the guillotine only a couple of weeks ago. On that occasion we were given less than 48 hours to consider amendments to taxation Acts comprising 1,500 pages in total. That is not just incompetence; it is typical of the arrogance of the Government towards the House of Representatives and the members that go to make up this House. In other words, in the most fundamental way we are denied the opportunity of representing our constituents' wishes time and time again on important taxation measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us now a series of Government amendments introduced in the Senate. Not only was the Government unable, because of a lack of foresight and legislative competence, to introduce this defective legislation in this House; it has to rely on the only true legislative chamber in the Parliament&mdash;the Senate&mdash;as a venue for doing what is right and necessary. We do not oppose these measures. We think there are amendments put forward by the coalition in the Senate which should also have been adopted by the Government. In some cases at least, and probably in most cases, our amendments would have served to improve the quality of the legislation in the sense that it would make it more workable and more in line with the Government's stated aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems reluctant to accept that many of the technical amendments proposed by the coalition were simply to make the legislation work, as it was intended, according to the statements&mdash;both press and second reading statements&mdash;of the Government. We find time and time again in this Parliament that the Government refuses, firstly, to give us the opportunity to debate legislation because it finds it necessary to introduce the guillotine, and, secondly, we are denied the opportunity to improve the Government's inadequate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are proposed amendments from the Senate to depreciation changes. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment gives effect to the Government's announced intentions and will prevent a potentially significant but unquantifiable loss to the revenue.</PARA>

Furthermore, it now says that it cannot tell us how much `saving'&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;to the revenue will be realised by the proposed amendment to depreciation changes. The explanatory memorandum merely states that `a potentially significant but unquantifiable loss to the revenue' will be involved by these amendments. Furthermore, the amendments will be backdated to 26 February 1992. Once again, businesses and taxpayers&mdash;those affected&mdash;will have arranged their affairs on the basis of the first draft and the Government's stated intentions, yet we have further amendments to the legislation, which could not possibly have been taken into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleagues for entering the chamber to hear my speech. The legislation before the House was introduced to establish an international air services commission whose responsibility it will be to divide up capacity and routes, given the Government's decision to allow multiple designation of carriers for international aviation into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to remember is that this is simply the latest development in a series of initiatives which this Labor Government has been responsible for. It was the Hawke Labor Government which took the courageous step to terminate the two airlines agreement. Notice of the termination of that agreement was given in 1987 and in 1990 we started to see the results of that courageous decision when Compass Airlines started up and provided dramatic competition in Australia's domestic aviation market. Consumers, Australia's air travellers, were provided with significant reductions in air fares. There was a massive increase in the number of travellers and it is this Government&mdash;and in fact my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who was the Minister for Aviation when the two-airline agreement termination decision was made, and others&mdash;which took the courageous decision to press ahead with deregulation of our domestic aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Air Services Commission Bill seeks to extend that to the international sector. In the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Government announced that it had decided to allow Qantas to compete in the domestic aviation market. The Government decided to allow our domestic aviation carriers&mdash;then Australian and Ansett, and perhaps Compass in the future&mdash;to apply for and compete on international aviation routes to and from Australia. In addition, in the One Nation statement the Government announced that it wanted to have a single aviation market across the Tasman so that carriers flying within Australia would also be able to fly to and from and within New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Air New Zealand has asked for equivalent rights within Australia and I understand that negotiations between the Australian and New Zealand governments are reaching a successful conclusion which will ensure that in the not too distant future we will have that single aviation market and as a result more competition, lower fares and an increase in the number of passengers flying the Tasman routes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask what the result of that will be. The result will be an expansion in tourism in both countries. There will also be an expansion in the number of jobs in our country as a result of that greater competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the One Nation statement, the Government has taken two further decisions in aviation. The first is to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines, a move which I believe for the first time will allow Qantas to compete on an equal footing with other major international airlines. We all know that airlines such as United and Continental often offer incentives to Australian travellers that if they fly with their airlines they can get cheap flights in the United States on the domestic routes of those airlines. Likewise, British Airways says that Australians travelling with that airline to the United Kingdom can get cheap flights throughout Europe on British Airways. In my view, we have always held Qantas back by not allowing Qantas a proper competitive basis. My colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who is in the chamber, would understand how important it is that Qantas be given a fair chance to take on its international competitors. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ensure that we all understand the purpose of this Bill, which is to ensure that there is a multiple designation regime for international aviation and that that will be introduced by 1993. The new International Air Services Commission will start operation in one week's time, so it is very timely legislation. The International Air Services Commission will be an independent body to allocate aviation capacity and route entitlements amongst Australia's international carriers&mdash;Qantas, the existing international carrier, perhaps Ansett, Compass if it decides to apply for international routes, and any other new aviation company that decides to start up in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bases for allocating these aviation rights are as follows: first of all, we want to ensure that all carriers have an opportunity to compete. Secondly, we think we have to balance the rights of new entrants against those of Qantas, the existing Australian international carrier. Thirdly, we want to minimise the extent of bureaucratic delay and bureaucratic burden. We also want to ensure that all processes are accountable and transparent. I think those four factors will ensure that this body performs its responsibilities properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should understand that this is a very complex issue. Qantas has invested tens of millions of dollars in advertising, in purchasing aircraft and in training its staff to build up its customer base on many international routes. It would not be fair to Qantas to say that overnight it has to vacate many of these international routes to some new Australian carrier&mdash;a competitor, whether it is Ansett or anyone else. Qantas has earned the right to ensure that it does not overnight lose routes which it has built up and invested money in over many years, and in some cases decades. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Qantas has done a great job in expanding tourism to Australia. Qantas spends a lot of money advertising the benefits of travelling to Australia and other countries. I think we need to remember how much Qantas earns for Australia's balance of payments. Some members of this House, including one or two from the other side of the chamber, say that tourism should always come first. I think all of us accept that tourism is a growth industry. It has created a lot of employment in Australia. At the same time, I do not think we should be taking actions which create benefits for overseas international airlines at the expense of Qantas when there is not a demonstrated benefit to Australia's tourist industry. I think all members of this House should be seeking to balance those two competing interests&mdash;the interests of Qantas earning revenue for Australia, which is good for our balance of payments, and the interests of Australia's tourist industry, which we should not be holding back from development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes that multiple designation apply to all routes, subject to the agreement of our bilateral aviation partners. I understand that a small number of those routes are still subject to single designation and that the Minister will be seeking to negotiate to convert those from single to multiple designation routes as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), in his contribution was critical of some aspects of the Government's aviation policy. In one area he claimed that this Government should have done more to allow charter carriers to bring tourists to Australia. For the record, I mention to the House that it was this Government which relaxed the charter guidelines in 1987 and again in 1990, with the aim of encouraging greater numbers of tourists to Australia, and therefore an expansion in jobs in this area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agreed to charter flights initially, which have ended up testing the market, and finally to develop the market so it will be mature enough to sustain scheduled services. Examples of that are Air Lanka and Air Mauritius. While this Bill provides for the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications to have the final authority to approve charters, the proposed commission will have the power to provide advice to the Minister and the Secretary to the Department. That procedure will allow people who wish to develop charter flights to put their views before the Government and the Secretary to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Government's performance in seeking to expand tourism and increase the number of overseas travellers who come to Australia, I think we can be very proud of the achievements of this Government, and in particular the honourable member for Shortland and his colleague in the Hawke Government Ministry, the former member for Parramatta, Mr John Brown, who put great emphasis on seeking to achieve an increase in the number of tourists travelling to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, only about one million international visitors came to Australia. That number has grown at an average annual rate of almost 12 per cent a year. That is a great expansion in tourism and a great expansion in jobs. In 1991, over 2 1/2 million international visitors came to Australia. Many people have been responsible for that success&mdash;including Paul Hogan and Greg Norman, who have volunteered their services to help promote Australia&mdash;not to mention Australia's film industry, which has helped to generate recognition for Australia. People such as the honourable member for Shortland and Mr John Brown can be very proud of their achievements in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the time and my understanding that other members wish to contribute to this debate, I conclude by congratulating the Minister on putting forward the proposal to establish this independent commission, which will be responsible for allocating capacity and routes. There are provisions in this legislation which I believe will strike the right balance between protecting Qantas's interests, protecting Australia's interests and ensuring at the same time that we do not hold back the growth and development of Australia's tourist industry. </PARA>

It is fine for Government members to stand up here and talk about the Government's achievements in aviation, but unfortunately the facts do not bear out the honourable member's claims at all. Recently we experienced the airline dispute. I do not see how that could have been regarded in any way as an achievement. In fact, it was a terrible blot not only on this country's industrial relations history but also on its airline industry. At that time we saw how the Government sided constantly with the companies involved in that dispute and how the then Prime Minister denigrated pilots with the sorts of comments he made about their being glorified bus drivers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, under freedom of information legislation, as the result of a request from the pilots' union, we saw evidence of clandestine meetings in the office of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, attended by representatives of the ACTU and the chief executives of both the airlines. Available now for all to see is evidence of the extent of the behind the scenes deals that were going on between the Government and the airlines to destroy the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The result of that&mdash;and it is still going on&mdash;is that there are unemployed Australian pilots in this country and many other Australian pilots have had to break up their families and go overseas to find work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is an achievement of this Government in aviation, I would like to see some improvement in what it has done.

Immediately prior to deregulation, it signed agreements with the two major airlines&mdash;these are the sorts of deals with mates that this Government is renowned for&mdash;making it, if not impossible, then very difficult for any new airline to get started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend that Brian Grey did not make mistakes with the setting up of Compass&mdash;he clearly did; but he set up the company with one hand tied behind his back and the other one rendered half inoperable because this Government, prior to deregulation, signed long term lease agreements for virtually all of the terminal space in Australia to be the exclusive province of Ansett and Australian Airlines. The only access Compass was given to terminals around Australia relied on the cooperation of one or the other major airline. That was another disgraceful act, a despicable act. It was a deal that this Government did, in the same way as it dealt with the two major airlines in those meetings in the Prime Minister's office during the pilots dispute. It did the same sort of deal with the major airlines in respect of terminal space immediately prior to deregulation. What sort of deregulation have we had?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all people to be talking about the effects of a GST upon tourism, one would think the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) would be the last to show his head. The effect of a GST is to provide a substantial incentive for people to holiday abroad. People holidaying within Australia, Australians holidaying in Australia, will be subject to all the impact of a GST&mdash;well in excess of 15 per cent as it is moved across the various parts of the transactions. That impacts upon domestic travellers and domestic holiday makers. Inbound holiday makers, the ones we are trying to encourage in this country, are also clobbered with the 15 per cent and all of its consequences. But if people want a holiday abroad they get an exemption; they do not have to pay the GST. That is a clear incentive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to my honourable friend that he think again, because his constituents and small business people would be absolutely clobbered, slugged by the imposition of a GST. The sheer ramifications of collection of a GST, recording every transaction, the cost of collecting it, storing all those documents for seven years, are horrendous. I say to him that in two ways the Opposition is really going to knife the tourism industry in his part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fascinating to listen to the honourable member for McPherson talking about the pilots dispute. Those who were in this Parliament at that time know very well the role the Opposition played in extending that dispute. I said at the time that one member of the Opposition was behaving as if he were an agent of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The Opposition by its succour, by its support, by its public adulation of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, extended that dispute and maximised the damage to the tourism industry. So members of the Opposition should not come into this place and clamour to us about the pilots dispute. The honourable member for McPherson was party to it, his colleagues extended it, and the Opposition bears responsibility for much of the damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question he raised about meetings with the airlines and Ministers, if he goes back and reads the newspapers he will find that one of those meetings was held in Melbourne. There was a large press conference after it and everybody who was at the meeting was at the press conference. It was all clear and above board. When we on our side of the House are developing policy and responses, we have to speak to people. We cannot develop policies and views in silence. So those matters are really no problem; that is really trivia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilots dispute was all about increasing productivity in the airline industry. Why? To make air travel more affordable in this country. Air travel is just another form of public transport. It ought to be available to as many people in this country as possible. We as a government and a party are totally committed to that objective. We fought for it over years. We opposed the snide extension of the two-airline agreement just prior to the 1980 election. No-one knew there had been a backroom deal until mid-1981. Fancy the Opposition talking about secret discussions! The two-airline agreement was extended in a secret discussion which nobody knew anything about until after it was all signed, sealed and delivered in 1980. It came out in the course of debate and discussion in 1981. That is why there was a split in the Liberal Party over it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to the House that airwaves and airways are very valuable national resources. One of the legacies we inherited from conservative governments over the decades was that, because they are very valuable national resources and because they can provide very large amounts of private profit and private benefit, they were heavily regulated by successive conservative governments, with the result that, whereas the two-airline agreement was of use and served Australia to some extent in its early years, it long outlived its usefulness and restrained the growth of airline travel in this country. As we saw last year, some 16.7 million Australians flew within this country&mdash;a 30 per cent increase on the previous year, if my figures are correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That came about because we as a government formed a view that the agreement had to be reviewed as it was a major adjunct to international airline travel. The agreement has since been terminated and Australians are now getting the benefit of that through greater competition. Similarly, the airwaves are regulated and some television stations did very well, thank you very much, and continue to look to further regulation of the airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the international airways and our rights under air service agreements are extremely valuable, and no nation in this world lightly enters into agreements or changes to air service agreements without consideration of its national interest. We need only look to Japan, the United States, France and the European Community to see how jealously they guard their rights under their air service agreements, and how parsimonious they are in changing those rights or giving out any benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us will provide for an International Air Services Commission that will perform the task of examining applications for access to international air routes, evaluating those applications and making decisions, in that way keeping the decisions at arm's length from the Government. Some people would say that overall in international air travel Australia is a pretty small player. There is some substance to that. We are a pretty small player in many ways. We have only one designated international carrier because on the scale of airlines we are small. But the amalgamation of Australian Airlines with our designated international carrier, Qantas, will strengthen the domestic base of our international carrier, while there are routes that Qantas does not see as appropriate to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go through all the legislation that is provided for because the Bill has been covered in second reading speeches in both places. I will, however, touch upon some parts of it. The International Airlines Commission will have the responsibility of determining the outcome of applications by airlines for capacity and route entitlements available under Australia's bilateral air service agreement. Its task is to determine and identify which designated carriers are selected to operate particular routes, to allocate available capacity and to set necessary conditions. With that responsibility the Commission must look to maximising the public benefit to be gained from the utilisation of that capacity. It would allocate capacity only to those Australian carriers which are reasonably capable of gaining the necessary approvals to operate on the route and are reasonably capable of implementing their proposals. The Bill provides for a definition of `public benefit' and provides that the Commission in its considerations must have regard to the requirement that there be a positive impact on Australian aviation industry structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the two-airline agreement earlier. The two-airline agreement is a superb example of regulation of a national resource to suit or benefit a particular party regardless of ownership or the individuals involved. It outlived its usefulness. It is said in some quarters that, if Qantas and Australian are amalgamated and there is another domestic operator, that domestic operator should automatically have a right to international services. That proposal raises a lot of questions in people's minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International rights to operate are very valuable. They are a national asset. With the regulation and utilisation of the airwaves we say in the case of pay TV, `Let us put those out to tender'. There is a very good argument for putting out to tender the rights to operate any unused air service or new international air service so that the people of this country get the benefit of it. Those who are interested will make a commercial judgment as to how much they would like to tender, whether it is appropriate to operate or not, whether it is worth having a go at or whether it is something they will walk away from and not be interested in. They are all matters for commercial judgment; they are not matters for governments to determine or, as some would say, give away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission's hearings will be public and it will have the responsibility of assessing those applications. It will have the responsibility of assessing the rights that are presently under-utilised, assessing new ones that come up for renewal as a result of expiry, and assessing new routes that may be developed with other countries. In addition it will be required to ensure that decisions concerning the matters set out in the legislation are in the public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a comparison with what happens in other countries. Four main countries have had to develop mechanisms for handling the determination of airlines' rights in a multiple designation environment. As I interpret the legislation, it is silent on multiple designation. It does not say that there should be one other operator; the matter is left unclear and unspoken. There could two, three, four or five operators, and that is how it should be. If New Zealand comes in to create a single market with Australia, it should not be left to just the existing operators if there are other domestic airlines, such as Compass, that want to be in that service. They should have the freedom to participate in that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, it is just another transport business. There is nothing magic about the airline business in the sense that it should have special treatment from the Government. There is nothing magic in the sense that dollars are counted any differently. If the business is run efficiently, is not too highly geared, markets well, provides a good product and competes well, it will do all right. If it does not, it will suffer the same problems that any other kind of business suffers if it does not compete well in the market and manage its business well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK has a civil aviation authority. It has responsibility for licensing and the economic regulation of airline activity. As with the Commission proposed in this Bill, the CAA conducts public hearings on matters relating to designation. It is not at arm's length from the Government as the proposed Commission in this country will be, and the ultimate decision on designation is made by the Minister of State for Transport. But the determinations made by the Minister can be appealed against. When the CAA started out with that kind of arrangement it was a pretty stormy sort of activity, but in the period since it has settled down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has a much more legalistic approach and has no body comparable to the Commission proposed in this legislation. The process remains essentially under the control of the Department of Transport. In the US it is an administrative law judge that makes determinations as to carrier designation. The judge passes this determination to a senior career official in the Department, who reviews the decision and makes an announcement as to the arrangements which will apply. The Department may overturn the decision, but it would have to justify that. This acts as a check or balance on Executive power. But, again, that process is not at arm's length, as the Commission provided for in this legislation will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the process in the United States is more legalistic. It is a costly and time-consuming process. As I understand it, the United States does not have any better alternative at the moment. In Japan there is no formal process for the making of designation determinations. The arrangements which eventuate generally arise out of a series of discussions and negotiations between the governments and the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission that we are putting before the Parliament is in a way singular. The system we are bringing in here is part of the process that this Government has pursued with vigour since it came into office to deregulate and free up the airline system, both domestically and internationally. We see transport as a major component of overall economic activity, and we see public transport such as the airlines as a service that ought to be available to all Australians and not restricted to the 10 to 15 per cent of Australians who were able to travel by air when this Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not let anybody in the Opposition raise in this chamber the two-airline agreement. It is the creature of those opposite. They cemented it in history. They kept it in history as long as they possibly could. They ensured in their 1981 legislation that it would be in force for another eight years. They split their own Party about it. To those who would come in here and lecture the Government about deregulation I say, `Go back and look at your own performance because no-one takes you seriously. Your record is well and truly known'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in respect of international airline services, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), almost from time immemorial in this place, has clamoured about letting more airlines into the country and letting more airlines flow. His own Party did not believe him. He was Chairman of the Select Committee on Tourism and his own Government did not believe him. His Committee brought down a report. Prime Minister Fraser did not accept him. He did not have any currency. I have respect for him as an individual and as an honourable member, but I could almost express his views verbatim because I have heard them so many times. They are slightly embellished from time to time, but the message is essentially the same as the one he was putting out in 1976-77. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the growth of the international airline market. We see that there was a downturn in international air travel last year. The report from the ICAO states that total aviation traffic was down 4 per cent in 1991 and international air traffic was down 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ICAO report made the point that in international terms that was the first year since the 1940s that world scheduled traffic had shown a decline. However, as a result of the efforts and decisions of this Government the picture in 1991 was totally different in Australia. Due mainly to the effects of deregulation, 1991 domestic passenger numbers were up nearly 30 per cent on the previous year, and even outstripped traffic growth in the previous record year, 1988, when high traffic was created by the Expo and bicentenary events. As I mentioned before, in the year ending December 1991, a record 16.7 million domestic passengers were carried. There is growth in international travel into Australia. I think 84.8 per cent of those passengers are carried by the top 10 airlines operating to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament needs to bear in mind that just a few years ago we saw the extension of air service rights or opportunities to operate into this country extended to a number of minor international airlines, which had the effect of devaluing Qantas. Those who were interested in floating or purchasing Qantas naturally looked to what routes it operated, what security it had on those routes and what profit could be earned on those routes. But then the Kangaroo route was opened up to a number of minor airlines, which are yet to produce substantial figures of traffic into this country. There is not a tougher business than the international airline business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a nation of 17.6 million people. We have 42 international airlines operating into this country. We have the prospect of more operators moving into the international scene to bring people to this country. I want to make the point that that decision by bureaucrats did have a damaging effect on the value of Qantas, and people need to remember and understand that. We are looking to continuing growth in the tourism market. Sydney took 48.9 per cent of the market in 1991 with 4.2 million passengers; Melbourne 19.7 per cent; and Brisbane 13.8 per cent. The top 10 carriers accounted for 84.8 per cent of the total passenger market for the 1991 year. The growth is there. It is a tough business to be in. We have a good product to offer international travellers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things that need to happen: firstly, we need to be as efficient as we can in the operation of airport services. People do not remember the colour of the paint on the outside of the terminal; they remember the smiles on the faces of the people who greet them and the price and quality of the services they enjoyed when they were here. Secondly, we need to do more in marketing Australia's destinations abroad. If we take the international airline policy of this Government, our domestic aviation policy and our very effective and vigorous policy towards tourism together, then we can continue to develop this industry and Australia's economy. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is another significant step along the path of fundamental reform initiated by the Government since taking office in 1983, reform which is transforming Australia's industrial relations landscape. The measures it proposes exemplify this Government's approach to industrial relations reform, as distinct from the Opposition's alternative. The fundamental elements of our approach are:</PARA>
<PARA>.a flexible industrial relations system that at the same time enhances efficiency and equity at the workplace and responds to national macro-economic imperatives;</PARA>
<PARA>.the existence of democratic organisations of employees and employers to represent the interests of their members, as in all truly free societies;</PARA>
<PARA>.a role for public institutions, notably independent industrial tribunals, to provide social protections through the safety net provided by an effective award system and to contribute to industrial stability through the machinery of conciliation and arbitration;</PARA>
<PARA>.consultation and cooperation between workers, their unions and employers as essential ways to ensure that industrial reform and workplace changes are best framed and implemented on a sustainable basis; and</PARA>
<PARA>.a legitimate and necessary government role in reforms through supportive policies and labour market programs to promote desired outcomes at the national, industry and enterprise levels. Abandoning the reform process to the whims of the market through deregulation would be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA>This practical approach, founded on firm social democratic values, is directed towards delivering the best and fairest economic outcomes for Australia. It recognises the vital role that our industrial relations institutions and practices have to play in achieving these outcomes. A best and fairest economy is marked by internal cohesiveness, flexibility, optimum development of the skills and productive performance of the people, and sustained growth in living standards with a fair distribution of national incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, since 1983, this Government has set out systematically to pursue these objectives by applying Labor's approach to delivering practical reforms:</PARA>
<PARA>.we have applied a flexible accord wages policy responsive to Australia's economic circumstances; this has delivered responsible wage outcomes, a dramatic expansion in employment through the 1980s, very low inflation and record low levels of industrial disputation;</PARA>
<PARA>.we have improved the legislative framework governing the Federal industrial relations system;</PARA>
<PARA>.we have strongly supported the overhaul of award and trade union structures in Australia through industrial relations policies, workplace reform programs and assistance for union rationalisation; we are driving fundamental complementary reforms in education and training; and</PARA>
<PARA>.we are managing and overseeing a transformation of industrial attitudes and behaviour, away from the adversarial relationships of the past and towards the cooperative approach that is most conducive to a new workplace culture; our catalytic programs have helped to accelerate and extend this transformation through wider acceptance of the need for workplace reform and the adoption of international best practice in Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA>This careful and sustained reform process has meant drawing together the industrial parties, with the tribunals, to work as one nation. It has necessarily rejected the `big bang' type of confrontationist approach which would bring confrontation back to the workplace, subvert the `umpire' role of the independent tribunals, and substitute blind reliance on market forces for wages policy and reform programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deregulationist agenda&mdash;preoccupied solely with activity at the enterprise level, with negative cost cutting, to the exclusion of industry and national strategies&mdash;would lead to the exploitation of the vulnerable and disadvantaged in the community. This would be at the expense of the longer term dynamic strategies&mdash;implemented realistically and cooperatively&mdash;which are needed for genuine flexibility and development of a mobile, highly skilled work force. Yet these are the prerequisite conditions to produce in Australia the high wage, high productivity type of economy which dominates world markets. The Government proposes through this Bill to extend the process of practical reform that builds on the achievements already made through our approach. We believe that is the priority, not only of Australian workers and their unions but also of the great bulk of the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the main proposals in the Bill. It has five main elements:</PARA>
<PARA>.a fundamental revision of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to facilitate and encourage workplace bargaining; the parties to a dispute within the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be enabled to reach agreement on terms to settle the dispute and to have the agreement certified by the Commission to operate as an award;</PARA>
<PARA>.a provision to enable the Commission to review unfair contracts;</PARA>
<PARA>.conferral of specific duties on the office of Vice-President of the Commission in relation to registered organisations of employers and workers;</PARA>
<PARA>.simpler processes for the recovery of unpaid award wages; and</PARA>
<PARA>.improved machinery for national consultation on industrial relations matters. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Certified Agreements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key aim of the new certified agreements provisions is to facilitate workplace bargaining agreements that boost productivity and improve the living standards of workers. There is now consensus in Australia on the need to focus industrial relations more directly on the enterprise and workplace. The participants in our system are moving steadily towards accepting greater responsibility for finding their own solutions to industrial differences, in a way which is constructive and produces lasting benefits for employers, workers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes made by the Industrial Relations Act in 1988 through the section 115 provision for certified agreements have been recognised as an important step forward. A certified agreement operates as a fixed term `closed' award for its agreed specified period and does not necessarily have to conform with national wage principles. Until recently, however, all sides&mdash;including the Commission&mdash;have shown a very cautious attitude towards certified agreements. In practice, and notwithstanding some notable innovative arrangements such as at ICI, there have been relatively few agreements presented for certification. We are clearly past the uncertainties about the benefits of more decentralised bargaining and it is obvious that, for various reasons, the provisions are too restrictive in their operation for current needs. Accordingly, last October, in a parliamentary statement, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) foreshadowed legislative action to address the issue. The Commission in its national wage decision later that month also referred to some difficulties in the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation thus reflects experience with more decentralised bargaining and the existing provisions. Essentially, we are proposing that, within the scope of the constitutional conciliation and arbitration power, parties to a dispute should be able to settle their differences and prevent future disputes with greater confidence that their agreement will be accepted for certification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater prominence will be given to certified agreements. A new division will be included in the Act to deal with such agreements. The division will be prefaced by a clause specifying that the objects of the division are to facilitate the making and certification of agreements and to encourage their use in the prevention and settlement of disputes. The Commission will be required to perform its functions under the new division in a way which furthers these objects as far as practicable. The intended effect of these provisions is to ensure that certified agreements are available as a real alternative to the mainstream award system and not reserved for exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be simple criteria for certification: no disadvantage to employees; the inclusion of dispute-settling provisions; and consultation by unions with their affected members about the agreement. If an agreement applies to a single business, including a project or joint venture, part of a single business, or a single workplace, there must be a single bargaining unit comprising all relevant unions, though the Commission will be able to permit exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key element of the new certified agreements provisions is that a certified agreement must not disadvantage the employees it covers, in respect of their terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances in which the Commission may find that an agreement will disadvantage employees are specified. It must first consider whether certification would result in the reduction of employment entitlements and protections for employees covered by the agreement, under an award or under any other law that the Commission considers relevant. If the Commission judges that such a reduction would occur, it must consider whether or not the reduction is contrary to the public interest, in the context of the terms and conditions of those employees considered as a whole. The provision is not intended to operate in a way to reduce well-established and accepted standards which apply across the community such as maternity leave, standard hours of work, parental leave, minimum rates of pay, termination change and redundancy provisions and superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This test is designed to allow some flexibility in the arrangements which parties may include in a certified agreement, but to prevent reductions in protections or entitlements if they are unfair or against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will be able to refuse to certify an agreement which applies more widely than to a single business if, as now, it considers the agreement to be contrary to the public interest. The Commission will only have such a discretion for an agreement which applies to a single business, part of such a business or a single workplace if the Minister for Industrial Relations applies to have the agreement's effect on the public interest considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ministerial power will only operate for 18 months as a safeguard while the operation of the new provisions becomes established. In these circumstances, an agreement may be refused certification if it is found substantially to jeopardise the public interest. Similar conditions will apply to the Commission's powers to review an agreement's operation once certified. I should emphasise that the ministerial power is not expected to be used in any but the most extreme circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A certified agreement will still be variable only during its specified period of operation on limited grounds, reflecting the agreement's `closed' nature. Under the new provisions, where parties agree, they will be able to extend the period of operation of a certified agreement. It is also proposed to change the arrangements which apply after agreements reach the end of their specified period of operation. At present, they cease to have effect after expiry. This has caused some difficulty. It is proposed that, after their specified term expires, agreements continue to operate but in the same manner as other awards. Alternatively, they can be replaced by a new agreement or a mainstream award or simply cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new division will also contain a number of changes designed to streamline procedures for the certification of agreements and to facilitate their use. There is now a requirement that a Full Bench must deal with agreements which the President considers to be inconsistent with general wage fixing principles. This will be removed. So will the requirement prohibiting a certified agreement being based on the terms of another certified agreement. Where the Commission has grounds for refusing to certify an agreement, it may permit parties to vary the agreement to make it certifiable or it may certify the agreement subject to undertakings as to its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions will represent a more complete approach to certified agreements, reflecting the Government's expectation that the parties will increasingly seek to have their own arrangements accepted and given effect in the federal system. They are designed to accelerate workplace reforms and lift our productivity performance. I emphasise that this will be undertaken within an effective framework which provides for best practice workplace bargaining, which ensures fairness and which maintains and consolidates appropriate roles for employers, unions and tribunals in the process. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Independent Contractors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to amend the Act to:</PARA>
<PARA>.give the Commission power to review unfair contracts for the performance of work by independent contractors;</PARA>
<PARA>.give independent contractors the choice of joining a federally registered union; and</PARA>
<PARA>.maintain and extend the protections against coercion available to independent contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable misunderstanding of the Government's legislative proposals regarding independent contractors, based either on misinformation or unwillingness to consider the actual effect of the proposals. In developing its proposals, the Government has consulted widely and at length with interested groups, particularly with employers. It has taken into account the needs of industry, as well as those of other relevant interests. In consequence, the Government made a number of amendments to the Bill before its introduction into this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal change was to remove proposed provisions that would have allowed the Commission to deal with certain industrial disputes about the use of independent contractors. In the Government's view, it was appropriate to clarify the Commission's role in this area because, in a modern economy, it is unrealistic to limit the jurisdiction of the national industrial tribunal strictly to matters involving only employees in the strict legal sense. Notably, the High Court has found that the principal constitutional power in respect of industrial disputes is not so limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's view is that the Commission already has a broad jurisdiction over industrial disputes concerning the use of independent contractors instead of employees to perform work, but considered that the issue should be put beyond doubt legislatively, with appropriate guidance for the Commission on how to exercise that jurisdiction. In the consultations with employer bodies, it became clear that they preferred to have the scope of the existing jurisdiction clarified by the High Court. The Government agreed to that course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other elements of the Government's proposals, to which I have already referred, are still both necessary and desirable. The unfair contract review procedure will allow a party to a contract that is harsh, unfair or against the public interest to apply to the Commission for its review. Where the Commission is of the opinion that the contract is harsh, unfair or against the public interest, it will be able to vary or set aside the contract. It will also have the power to make interim orders to protect the position of a party to the contract, pending the outcome of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the campaign of concentrated misinformation to which the Government's proposals have been subjected, it is necessary that I, on behalf of the Minister, set the record straight. The Government's proposals do not stop people working as independent contractors, as the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) well knows, if that is what they want to do. They do not convert such people into employees. What they will do is provide a cheap and convenient means of redress to individuals who are working as independent contractors and who are being exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can only wonder at the antics of the Housing Industry Association and others who are campaigning so vigorously against the proposals. Why do they object so strongly to measures that will protect exploited members of the work force? If there is no exploitation, then the proposed provisions will have no operation. Notably, other employer bodies, although they do not regard the legislation as necessary, are not associated with this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals do not introduce uncertainties into the tendering process. They will have no practical application to freely entered into contracts of a commercial nature. Decided cases before the New South Wales industrial tribunal under equivalent legislation make it clear that the Commission will not intervene to protect people who merely regret having entered into commercial contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions provide a way to redress situations of unfairness on the merits of the case, without resort to the civil courts and the attendant costs and delays, or the unrestrained abuse of pressure tactics. The new arrangements will operate only on a case by case basis, not on a general or class action basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the extraordinary claims which have been made is that the new provisions will lead to increased prices for houses. This is nonsense. The proposed unfair contracts review procedure is more limited than that now available under some State laws. Such a procedure has existed in New South Wales for many years, and has recently been carried over by the former Greiner Government into the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991. There has been no evidence that those provisions have increased housing prices. As the Master Builders Association has acknowledged, the Government's proposals will not lead to such increases. To claim otherwise is simply scaremongering. Those people who are responsible for it know that because that is their purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing independent contractors to join federally registered unions is not novel. Some independent contractors do so now. In addition, a union will not be able to seek among independent contractors a wider class of members than it may seek among employees. The protection available to independent contractors under the Act will continue to apply, and is to be extended to make it clear that an independent contractor may not be compelled to join a union nor be discriminated against on account of membership or non-membership of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `independent contractor' covers individuals who are performing work under a contract for services as opposed to employees who perform work under a contract of service. It will be explicitly limited to natural persons.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An increasingly important area of the work of the Commission relates to registered organisations of employers and employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make it easier for employees to recover relatively small amounts of money to which they are entitled under awards. This will provide a more efficient method of enforcing awards in situations where complex legal procedures and legal representation are unnecessary. A virtually identical scheme already exists in New South Wales for small claims under State awards. Similar schemes are commonplace for consumer claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new small claims system will apply to claims brought in magistrates courts for amounts up to $5,000. The Government will be able to increase this amount by regulation. The main features of this new system will be exclusion of legal representation, relaxation of the rules of evidence and overcoming technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present small but blatant breaches of award obligations can occur without it being worth while for employees to incur the legal expenses necessary to enforce their award entitlements. These small claims typically involve no difficult questions of legal interpretation, making the involvement of lawyers an unnecessary complication and expense. It is proposed that representation by a barrister or solicitor will not be allowed unless the magistrate decides to allow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to give the Government power to make regulations restricting the magistrate's discretion to allow legal representation. For example, legal representation could be prohibited except when all the parties to the litigation agree to allow it. This is now the case under New South Wales legislation governing small claims under State awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of constitutional restrictions, the Commonwealth can only restrict a State magistrate's power to allow legal representation if State legislation already imposes the same restriction on the relevant State courts. That is why the Bill provides for this to be done by regulation. The regulations will be prepared in consultation with States that have enacted relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations will also be able to ensure that officers of unions or employer groups will be allowed to appear in court to represent their members. The Commonwealth only has the constitutional power to do this if State legislation already includes comparable provisions governing the State jurisdiction of the relevant courts. This constitutional restriction will make it necessary for regulations to be made on a State by State basis, as for the regulations concerning legal representation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague and friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) for the opportunity once again to indulge in a very favourite pastime of mine in this House: locking horns with the honourable member for Charlton. There is a certain irony, a certain coincidence, of some historical significance so far as industrial relations law in Australia is concerned, that this particular debate, which is about an amendment to the Federal industrial relations law, should take place on the very day that the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations of the past several years, Mr John Fahey, has been installed as Premier of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me commence my remarks by saying that, despite the rather unfortunate circumstances in which Mr Fahey has assumed the premiership of New South Wales, I personally congratulate him on the assumption of that very high office. He is a man I have an enormous respect for. I believe that he did an outstanding job for the coalition in shepherding the industrial relations legislation through both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council in New South Wales. It will for ever be to the credit of the Greiner Government in New South Wales that it was prepared to stick to its guns, despite the adversity of numbers in the upper House in New South Wales, in order to get vital legislation reforming Australia's industrial relations system through the New South Wales Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is true that it was the Queensland National Party Government&mdash;with which I did not always totally agree&mdash;that was responsible for the first legislation in Australia endowing individuals with the right to make direct employment contracts bypassing unions and industrial relations tribunals, it has in fact been in New South Wales that at a State level such legislation looks like surviving intact, at least for a considerable period of time. So I commence my remarks by acknowledging the contribution of the new Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, to the cause of industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to my friend the honourable member for Charlton, as I do to my friend the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), that the tide of history is against those who would retain the institutional grip of the organisations on industrial relations in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I call the Minister, I would like to make a brief statement to the House. The message from the Senate returns to the House the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 with two amendments. I have had an opportunity to consider these amendments. Amendment No. 2 seeks to increase the maximum amount which may be paid to Tasmania by way of assistance for local government purposes. There is a standing appropriation in the principal Act which appropriates funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for whatever payments are made under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this amendment clearly is to increase the sum of money that may be appropriated under the Act. The House will be aware that the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue therefore arises as to whether the Senate is able under the Constitution to amend the Bill in this way or whether the desired changes should have been made to the House by way of a request for an amendment. In considering this question, it needs to be said that in both the second reading speech of the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government and the explanatory memorandum of this Bill it is said that the net financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill is nil. This situation was explained by the Minister in these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in funding to the Northern Territory and Tasmanian local government will be offset by an equivalent reduction in the general purpose assistance provided to those State governments.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I understand that it is the intention of the Government to reduce the payments to the Northern Territory and to Tasmania made under other legislation by the increases in funding made under this Bill. However, this intention is not reflected in the Bill presently before the House. In the terms of the Bill presently before the House, the amendment increases the potential charge on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As I said in a similar situation on 20 December last, it is naturally for the House itself&mdash;not for me&mdash;to consider such matters. I believe that my role is limited to bringing such issues to the notice of honourable members.</PARA>

As the Senate has apparently passed, with the approval of those who are the advisers to the President, an amendment which it asserts to be within its power, if you assert that it is not within its power, do you believe that it is appropriate that the matter be debated here, or are you suggesting that it is now a matter for resolution of this House and that we reject the amendments passed in the other place on the basis of their being ultra vires?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is not altogether a matter to be treated as lightly as I would suggest the Committee seems to be treating it. What we are saying is that the advice to you as the Chairman of this Committee is that a motion that has been supported by the Senate, presumably asserting that it is within its authority, we assert is in contravention of section 53 of the Constitution. I do not know that that is good enough. The Minister has given us a fairly bland sort of assertion. All he has done is move a motion. While that might satisfy him in one sense, it hardly satisfies the will of this chamber. This is not a matter we can treat just on the basis of an advice from the Minister. I think there is a fundamental concern. Obviously the Senate has passed the amendment only because it has taken counsel and decided that it is within its authority to pass the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the reasoning that Mr Speaker gave to us. He is suggesting that there is going to be a variation, as I understood it, in the financial allocation between the States. I put to you, Mr Chairman, that a variation is different from a reduction in the financial allocation. I suggest that there is absolutely nothing against the other place deciding that there should be a variation in the way in which funds should be provided. I would accept that, if there were going to be a reduction in the quantum of money, that would be ultra vires the other place in accordance with the Constitution. I put to you, Mr Chairman, that there have been many occasions when the other place has said that there is a capacity to reallocate funds as they have been provided by a motion of this place on reference to the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite seriously say that we are taking too lightly the motion of the Minister. It is a matter of some significance, if there should be a reapportionment. I come from New South Wales, and for a long while in both New South Wales and Victoria individual taxpayers have believed that they have been charged disproportionately because their funds, under our tax reimbursement formula, are distributed amongst those States with lesser populations. As a result, the individual services provided are somewhat less per capita than would otherwise be the case. Indeed, there is a fundamental problem. Mr Greiner, who I believe was an outstanding Premier of New South Wales and who regrettably has handed in his resignation today, sought to ensure that the burden on the individual residents of New South Wales should be no greater than that on the residents of any other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the consequence of this motion, it is suggesting that the Senate is not able to reapportion funds provided under other legislation. I disagree with the suggestion by Mr Speaker that that is outside the powers of the Senate. Therefore, we need to look very closely at the provisions of the first part of the motion the Minister has now submitted to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from that initial concern I raised, I think there is a fundamental problem. While I know that in the proceedings of this place it is going to be very awkward to get the advice we need and to take the time to consider the matter in detail, I think there is a fundamental problem. The problem is twofold. The one relates very much to what I understood to be the matter that was put before the last Premiers Conference, that is, the proper apportionment of funds between individual citizens of the more populous States as against the less populous States. The second is the extent to which the Senate, for whatever reason, might decide within its powers that it is going to reapportion funds provided there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to be assured that the advice being given by the Minister in the form of this motion is valid and correct.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was graciously pleased to allow the interruption of this debate I was talking about industrial relations and saying a few things about the enormous contribution that has been made by the new Premier of New South Wales to the cause of industrial relations reform in Australia. I was reminding the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and others in this House who have an intense interest in industrial relations that the tide of history and the tide of change is against those who would seek to defend to the bitter end the institutional grip of organisations on industrial relations in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what people may say about this or that dispute, the fact remains that there is an inexorable historical process under way in Australia at present which will sweep away the bargaining monopoly held by trade unions in this country; it will sweep away the nostrums of the industrial relations club; and it will sweep away the insufferably arrogant assumption made by the present industrial relations system that men and women in Australia are too stupid to be trusted with the responsibility of deciding what is good for them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the absolute essence of the whole debate on industrial relations. I say to those opposite: `Are you for a regime which denies men and women in Australia the right to decide their own future, or are you in favour of a regime which forever ties them to the mandatory intervention of industrial organisations or industrial tribunals?'. I have to say to those opposite, and to my friends opposite&mdash;I do have a number of friends opposite&mdash;that the tide of history is against what they are trying to defend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a few years ago that their Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), would get up in Question Time as Treasurer and say that there was no way he would ever embrace enterprise bargaining in Australia. He would argue against the very notion of enterprise bargaining in Australia. He would say that it was completely incompatible with the Australian culture and the Australian experience. Yet what he is now doing, and what the honourable member for Charlton was doing a few moments ago, and what I am sure the honourable member for Oxley will do in a few moments when he contributes to the debate, is saying, `Yes, we are in favour of enterprise bargaining and we in the Labor Party are introducing the latest model of enterprise bargaining'. The honourable member for Oxley nods assent. I am glad that he confirms the argument that I am putting, which is that the ground has shifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember in 1986 when the coalition embraced for the first time the notion that people should have the right to strike their own bargains outside the industrial relations system. I can remember that the wrath of the gods and of Cain and everybody else descended upon us. They said, `You can't do that in Australia; it's tyrannical; it's disgraceful; it's outrageous. The ACTU is on us. Some members of the Business Council are onto us. Some people in the Metal Trades Industry Association are onto us. The ACM is shaking its head. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>'&mdash;that great bastion of centralised wage fixation&mdash;`is onto us'. The ones to finally turn out the light on centralised industrial relations will be the editorial writers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those people were down on us and said that it could not be done and now they are craving respectability as enterprise bargainers. They have become in those terms the ultimate harlots of the industrial relations debate. Five years ago they were saying that enterprise bargaining was anathema to the Australian psyche and the Australian culture. Now they are trying to wrap themselves in the clothing of enterprise bargaining. What they are saying now is, `We believe in enterprise bargaining too but we can do it better than you'. Yet five years ago enterprise bargaining was absolute anathema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember the honourable member for Blaxland getting up and saying he was in favour of financial deregulation and all other forms of deregulation. However, he said that when it came to deregulation of the labour market it could not be done: because the power shares held by the trade union movement were too great there could not be a deregulation of the labour market. That was an erroneous proposition when he asserted it in 1986. By the Government's manic embracing of the language of enterprise bargaining it is acknowledging just how much ground has shifted in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four essential principles in our philosophy of industrial relations. They are very simple propositions. The first and foremost proposition is that every man and woman in Australia has the right to strike a direct bargain with his or her employer or employee. In other words, it ought to be competent, it ought to be possible, permissible, for corporations or other employers in Australia to enter into direct employment contracts with their employees without the mandatory intervention of an organisation or an industrial tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not saying that it should be compulsory. We are not saying that every single employer or employee should do it. What we are saying is that, if people want to do it, what in the name of everything that is understood about an Australian fair go should prevent men and women over the adult age making a rational decision about their own future? Yet incredibly enough, in the enlightened era of 1992, when this country in my view undoubtedly suffers from what I can only describe as anti-discrimination overload, we are obsessed on certain issues about any kind of intervention into individual rights and liberty. Anybody who tries to assert any kind of community standard on certain things is howled down as some kind of troglodyte conservative. If one stands up and says there are certain things that, according to standards of decency and taste ought not to be communicated on television or on radio, one is accused of being a screaming, old-fashioned conservative. Yet the same people who scream abuse at those who would seek to uphold some of those standards are the very people who say, `Never shall Australian men and women have the right to decide their own future so far as their employment opportunities are concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard this as one of the most extraordinary double standards that this country has seen. Those very people who are the loudest in proclaiming the libertarian philosophy when it comes to a lot of other things would deny workers the right to decide that they, and not a union or an employer organisation, know what is best for their future. That is the cradle of our first principle. That is what it is all about. It is not about destroying trade unions; it is not about denying people the right, if they so choose, to have their employment relationship regulated by an award; it is not about saying that Australian trade unions do not have a legitimate role in Australian society; and it is not about asserting that employers are always right and unions are always wrong. I have never asserted that. The honourable member for Charlton knows that only too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met some grisly employers in Australia, as I am sure the honourable member for Charlton has met some grisly trade union officials. It is to the shame of this country that somehow over the years there has not been an earlier recognition that there are some extremists on both sides who do the cause of rational industrial relations a great deal of harm. I am not into the business of imposing on this country some kind of totally unrestrained neanderthal approach to industrial relations, because, under principle No. 1 of our approach, part and parcel of the right we are going to give to people to go outside the system is to write into the necessary legislation certain minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have a minimum hourly rate of pay. According to the law we will pass, people who go outside the industrial tribunal, outside the award system, and form a contract with their employer or employee will have to observe that minimum standard. They will not be able to escape it. They will not be able to contract out of it. They will also have to observe things such as annual leave. I say quite openly to the Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton, that the idea of having an argument about the reasonableness of a basic four weeks annual leave in Australia is ludicrous. I am not about to embrace some kind of argument on that proposition. I know enough about my fellow country men and women to understand that that sort of thing simply is not on. There will also be minimum standards about sick leave. These are the sorts of things that people are entitled to have guarantees about. They are entitled to have guarantees about such things as long service leave, health and public safety regulations, as they will under State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly that if people decide to go into contractual arrangements, matters such as the length of the working week, whether or not there should be any penalty rates or holiday loadings and whether there should be any redundancy arrangements ought to be matters of negotiation. On the other hand, if people are going to stay under the umbrella of an award system, so be it. It will be determined by the relevant tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister, for whom I have great respect, that the first and important principle, although it will enable people to have a freedom they do not now have, will not give an untrammelled right of potential exploitation to any employer in Australia, because it will be circumscribed by those very necessary minimum standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman knows well that that is not the line that has been peddled by some of his colleagues who would have us believe and have the Australian people believe that the Liberal Party is into the business of hacking away at annual leave entitlements and sick leave entitlements. We are not into the business of providing a charter for exploitation of the weak. We are into the business of providing a charter for those self-confident men and women of Australia who believe they have the right above everybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister asserts, by the shaking of his head, the most neanderthal proposition imaginable: no matter how intelligent, no matter how gifted and no matter how self-assured categories of men and women in Australia may be, they should never have the right to decide what their remuneration will be; they can be allowed to do it only if they run it past some kind of official for whom they have never voted and whom they have never met and never want to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Australian people and I know that the compelling logic of what I am arguing is the reason why this debate has shifted under the Government's ground. The whole political strategy of the Labor Party and the ACTU between now and the next election will be to try to be as much like the Liberals as possible so that the people will not think there is any difference in voting for them. That is exactly what Government members are on about. They are not on about anything else. They are on about dissolving the differences. My friend the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who normally makes a very robust contribution to debates&mdash;and I welcome his entry into the chamber&mdash;knows exactly the point I am making. That is principle No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principle No. 2 is one that I am sure even the honourable member for Charlton, in his moments of total private candour, would acknowledge is a fair principle: the principle of freedom of association. Surely a man who supported conscientious objection to military training must support the right to join or not to join an industrial organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am right. I am absolutely right. It follows from the honourable member's passionate espousal of the principle of conscientious objection to military service that if one supports the right of a man or woman not to be conscripted, one must support the right of a man or woman not to be forced to join an organisation. In case any of that canard gets a run later in the debate, I say that I think that principle ought to be applied with equal force to professional organisations in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am a great believer in broadening one's tastes. I think one should have a totally catholic view of the world on these matters. I have certainly broadened my tastes on professional practices. I say to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), the Prime Minister's early friend from the Centre Left in Queensland, that I believe there should be an equal application of that principle of voluntary association&mdash;no compulsory unionism; no closed shops; no preference clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third great principle of the policy is the maintenance of the rule of law; in other words, those gains that have been made against the predatory behaviour of industrial organisations over the last 10 years in the great Mudginberri dispute, the great Dollar Sweets dispute, and the pilots dispute, where we are infinitely indebted to a former President of the ACTU for upholding the principle of the potential liability of industrial organisations for damages inflicted on Australian corporations. Resting on those impeccable precedents, we will certainly not embrace the notion of some kind of toy labour court, some kind of putty in the hands of the trade union establishment in Australia. Our fourth very important principle is that, if somebody wants to join a union in this country, that person should have the right to join the union of his choice, be it a craft union, an industry union or, dare I say it, a company or enterprise union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not against industry unions. If people want to vote in a democratic fashion to form industry unions, what right have I to stop them doing it? Let me say to the Minister opposite that if the employees of Toyota Australia want to form the Toyota Australia Staff Association and they want to give that body the exclusive right to negotiate on their behalf with the management of Toyota about their wages and conditions, what earthly right does the Government have to go along and say that they cannot do it, that they should be some kind of miserable, clerical fragment of a giant nationwide union that has auto workers, spare parts workers, metal workers, timber workers, mine workers and people making remote decisions in centralised union offices? The Government talks about the remoteness of Canberra. If members of the Government are allowed to finish their process of union rationalisation, they will have the most remote union structure this country has seen. I am for choice when it comes to union membership. We will defend the right of people to join as well as not to join unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People's right to enjoy tax deductibility of their bona fide subscriptions will be left totally untouched. There has never been any suggestion on our part that that will be interfered with. They will have the right to decide what kind of union they want to join. That will mean more unions; I acknowledge that. But I happen to think that is right and democratic, and it is the right principle based on freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real objective of the coalition in the area of industrial relations is to bring about an industrial relations climate that brings forth the productive talents of Australian employers and employees. I believe that the goal of many people in the Government is the same as my goal. We all want a more productive Australia, rising living standards and security for our families. There is no argument about that. Our disagreement is about the way we get there. We happen to believe that the best way of getting the optimum outcomes for the Australian nation is to say to individual Australians, `Here is the most congenial economic climate we can give you. You take advantage of it and work your heart out to the best of your ability and, at the end of the day, we are going to have a more prosperous Australia'. The Government's answer is, `Yes, we want to have that more prosperous goal, but you don't trust individual Australians. You never do that. Oh, no. That is one thing you must never do'. Ultimately, the Government's bottom line is that individual Australians are mugs, that they do not have the capacity. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is wrong with the Government's system. That is why it has delivered such rotten productivity performances. Despite all the Government's bleating about and criticism of New Zealand, the latest economic evidence coming out of New Zealand is showing that it is starting to get a few runs on the board. It is starting to show a bit of growth. It is starting to win a few productivity gains from its industrial relations policy. It is starting to see a bit of a turnaround in its current account deficit. New Zealand has gone through a long dark valley of economic downturn, most of it due to the fact that for 30 or 40 years it paid itself more than it could afford by way of retirement benefits and the like. But it is now starting to turn around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said repeatedly in this House, I do not tie myself to the New Zealand industrial relations model. I have been studious in rejecting that proposition. But I have to observe, as somebody who is interested in passing in what is happening in New Zealand, that things are starting to turn around. I reckon that by the time the election is held they will have turned around a lot more. I do not think we will hear very much from the Government about New Zealand in the election campaign. The Government will probably try to dredge up some other country; it will probably get into Argentina or Chile or somewhere like that in order to run a bit of a fear campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps with the few minutes I have left I should say something specifically about the provisions of this Bill. This Bill is a moth-eaten relic of what was originally designed. The Minister will have to concede that the moths have really got to this Bill. He talked about a big bang. This was going to be the grand slam takeover of independent contractors by the Industrial Relations Commission. All of the employer organisations, to their very great credit, went along to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and said, `Look, if you go ahead with this legislation in its present form, we are going to run a very powerful campaign exposing that Bill to the Australian public'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill in its original form would have enabled, for example, the Building Workers Industrial Union&mdash;that is Senator Cook's old union; that is the union that Mr Gyles had a few critical things to say about in New South Wales&mdash;to go along to the Industrial Relations Commission and put in a log of claims for all people in the home building industry. Despite anything that was said to the contrary and all this talk about sham transactions, of course there is a harsh and unconscionable provision in legislation at a State level. That has been</PARA>
<PARA>there for years. That is where it belongs. It ought not to be limited to harsh and unconscionable industrial contracts; it ought to apply to any kind of contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Courts of equity from time immemorial have had a right to set aside harsh and unconscionable agreements. It is there now. In my State of New South Wales, if a person is an independent contractor, he does not need the passage of this Bill to complain about a harsh and unconscionable contract; he can go to the Equity Court now and ask for it to be annulled. Why on earth does the Government want to intrude the Industrial Relations Commission? The only reason the Government is intruding it is that that is all that is left of the originally desired intrusion. It is the relic; nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original idea was that the Government put all of these things within the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission. It threw in `harsh and unconscionable', took fright and took out section 127A. It is now left with just the relic. It sits there like the proverbial sore thumb. There is really basically no reason for it at all. It is all that is left of what was originally the big pay back to the BWIU because of the Troubleshooters decision by the High Court. Nothing can expunge the fact that Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary in Victoria, sent out the levy for $10 a head to pay the fine imposed by the Federal Court. He said, `Don't worry, brothers, it is all all right. The Minister has told me he will amend the Industrial Relations Act to overcome the effect of Troubleshooters'. I have got it there in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has nothing do with sham contracts; it has nothing to do with those migrant women outworkers in the textile industry. If the Labor Party had really been worried about them, it would have done something about it eight or nine years ago. It has everything to do with overturning the Troubleshooters decision. Troubleshooters got up the Government's nose. The reason it got up the Government's nose is that it beat the system in Melbourne. The system had ground to a halt in Melbourne and the only way one could get anything done on a building site in Melbourne was to call in Troubleshooters. What really got up the Government's nose, when it analysed it, was that the blokes on Troubleshooters were ending up getting higher pay than they would have been if they were under the award. In other words, the Government could not run the old exploitation argument. It simply was not available. That is what really got up the Government's nose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was too much for the mandarins of the ACTU, so it said, `Come on, Peter, we want that fixed'. Of course, Peter took fright; he ran. They huffed and they puffed on the employer side and he gave way. I am not quite sure precisely where the Democrats came out, but they came out fairly sensibly, at least in the interim, in relation to the Metway Bank, and I will come to that in a moment. Really the Government should scrap the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said originally that, if the Government changed section 115 to make if easier, I would be attracted to it. I do not think the Government has made it easier. A lot of people in industrial relations who do not necessarily agree with me on other things agree with me that the Government has not really made it easier. It has created a situation where Bill Kelty can ring up Peter Cook any time over the next 18 months and say, `Hey, I do not like the enterprise agreement that has been put through. I want you to approach the Industrial Relations Commission to have it set aside'. I actually think the way in which this Government has treated the members of the Industrial Relations Commission has been, to say the least, very uncivil. </PARA>

You have made it perfectly clear that you want to diminish our role. If the Parliament of Australia diminishes our role, we will live with that'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a miserable moth-eaten relic of what was originally going to be a bold further intrusion. It does not deserve the support of the Parliament. Section 115 is not liberalised. It is unnecessarily confusing the situation regarding harsh and unconscionable contracts. There is no requirement for the appointment of additional deputy presidents. The President has ample authority. Quite honestly, it is a Bill that ought to be well and truly thrown out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments are the result of a deal that has been struck between the Government and members of the Democrats in the Senate resulting from a long-standing inquiry conducted by the Senate into superannuation reform in this country. We opposed these proposals in this chamber and in the Senate, and we continue to do so. We firmly believe that the approach being taken by the Government to the introduction of a compulsory superannuation levy is fundamentally flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to some of the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, when introducing these proposed amendments. He claimed that the superannuation guarantee legislation represented some major advances in superannuation policy, specifically for the working men and women of Australia. He claimed four points. Firstly, it will allow them when they retire to benefit from a much higher retirement income. Secondly, it will allow future governments to increase the age pension in line with community expectations. Thirdly, it will reduce the future burden on today's youth flowing from our increasing aged-dependence ratio. Fourthly, it will provide for a much needed increase in private and public sector savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues Senator Alston and Senator Watson, in a minority report tabled in the Senate as a result of the inquiry I referred to, directed their efforts at explaining specifically the fundamental flaws in virtually all of these arguments. For example, it is claimed that it is going to significantly increase savings. The truth of the matter is that evidence was taken by the Senate inquiry from a host of people in the banking industry and the finance industry, as well as in the superannuation industry. It came out time and time again that the evidence on which this legislation is based is fundamentally flawed. For example, Professor John Freebairn said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to providing high income in retirement is the pursuit of policies promoting high economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Paddy McGuinness argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weight of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Treasury, which above all is the summum bonum of advice to the Government on this matter, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non-superannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings . . . Some substitution . . . can be expected, however, . . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is likely to be a very considerable switching effect&mdash;not a perfect effect by any means, but a very high level of switching. Therefore it cannot be said with any degree of confidence that there will be any particular level of increase in savings as a result of the SGL regime. These are the issues which are the very basis of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go on to make a further point. It was claimed by Senator McMullan that these proposals will have the effect of allowing people to retire with a much higher income. It is perhaps potentially true that if people's level of contributions is high&mdash;in this case up to 12 per cent is anticipated by the year 2002&mdash;they will be taken out of part of the pension. Whether they are taken out of the pension system entirely tends to ignore some fundamental realities of the employment strata and trends in Australia at the present time. If it is assumed that Australians are continually contributing because they are in full time employment, perhaps that objective can be achieved. However, the trend would suggest that many of those people are going to be in part employment for part of their lives as well as in full employment for other parts of their lives and, sadly, they may well spend considerable periods out of employment altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is fundamentally lacking in this proposal is the capacity to create a series of bridges throughout life, so that people will be able to fund their retirement to an adequate extent on the basis not only of their capacity to pay but also of the capacity to pay of their employers. This is one of the fundamental flaws in this legislation. The Government has simply ignored the fact that under current circumstances there are thousands of employers who are literally desperately hanging onto every dollar they can just to keep the doors open, just to keep people in employment, just to keep the proverbial wolf from the door. We are seeing every day a growing number of business failures and businesses going bankrupt. In this dreadful environment, they are now being told that they have to provide a further 4 per cent increase in the level of compulsory superannuation contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our colleagues in the Senate, the Democrats, argue that they have done a great thing. They have reduced the impact on business. Why? Firstly, this proposal was meant to commence in July this year and now it will not commence, in accordance with these amendments, until early next year. Secondly, it was meant to be at the rate of 5 per cent. Big deal, they have reduced it to 4 per cent. Small changes of this nature have been introduced. Perhaps the only one of any significance is in relation to small business, where the amount has been increased by a considerable sum for those companies which will not be subject to coverage by the legislation. Nevertheless, the fundamental problem is that there are winners in some cases, perhaps, but there are also significant losers in these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to the problem of affordability. One of the major damning indictments of the SGL proposals in this legislation and in these amendments relates to the impact they are going to have on employment. The Senate Committee was told, this House has been told and the Government has been told by employers across Australia that the very minimum cost to jobs will be 60,000 and it could be as high as 100,000. Despite this fact, in its doctrinal stupidity the Government is persisting with introducing proposals when it is quite clear from what I have said that so many employers can ill afford or are incapable of carrying these additional costs at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not just play around the edges; it involves substantial cost increases to provide superannuation cover. Some 800,000 non-managerial, non-award private sector wage and salary earners will be brought into the scheme. Possibly 50,000 to 100,000 public sector employees who currently lack effective coverage will be brought into the scheme. Many of those public sector employees at the present time are not adequately covered because of poor vesting arrangements. These are the sorts of issues the Government has not adequately addressed in these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are possibly 650,000 employees of non-complying employers, of whom at least 600,000 are in the private sector, who will also be brought into the system. In other words, these new people represent some 25 to 30 per cent of private sector employment around Australia and possibly 5 per cent in the public sector. Overwhelmingly, these are the people employed by small business. They are often young professionals who are consciously determined to try to pay off their homes before they enter into superannuation when they are closer to retirement. Regrettably, the great bulk of them are employees earning less than average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Democrats will say they have done a great job because they have increased from $250 to $450 a month the threshold under which people will not have to make contributions. But the sad fact of the matter, as we have said in this House on many occasions, is that the Government's proposals do not adequately cover people in part time employment&mdash;explicitly the hundreds of thousands of women who are in part time employment&mdash;who are being unfairly treated by current superannuation policies and who will not be adequately supported in any way by the proposals to have come before the House over recent weeks and, finally, tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, at the final bell employers will have to make a determination: `Are we going to enter into this scheme or are we going to put off workers?'. The fact of the matter is that many of the workers who will lose their jobs are precisely these part time workers who are lucky to have any work at all under current circumstances&mdash;in an economy where some one million people are unemployed, where probably another half a million people are underemployed and where there are hundreds of thousands of young people who cannot get into the work force. Despite all those realities, all that pain and the destruction of all the hopes and expectations among those people, the Government is effectively introducing a proposal which at this stage the economy simply cannot sustain for economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has put forward a proposition, as did Senator McMullan in the other place, for the establishment of a society which cannot be achieved under current circumstances. It has set a range of four goals which will not be achieved. Therefore, the Opposition, regrettably, continues to oppose the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second Bill in a series of superannuation Bills to come before the Parliament, being the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. This Bill refers specifically to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and some amendments thereto, the taxation Acts and, finally, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. I wish to make a number of observations about the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government characteristically agreed with the Australian Democrats that it would amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to permit the superannuation contributions covered by the superannuation guarantee scheme to be taken into account when the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is making its decisions in national wage cases. Honourable members will be aware that this matter has quite a history. A case went before the High Court which determined that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did in fact have the authority to include superannuation matters in the context of determining its wages and terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Opposition would like to make the point and have it on the record that it is particularly concerned that there is no proposal for, or any conception of a guarantee of, productivity increases. We are simply being asked to agree that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should effectively place into awards increases in superannuation from time to time on the basis of promises which may or may not be made and which may or may not ever be achieved. It seems to us that, if there is going to be any possibility of achieving an effective universally based system of superannuation in this country, one of the criteria should surely be that there must be increases in productivity at least to compensate for the additional charges brought down on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking here about a mere bagatelle. For the last two years we have been talking about a 3 per cent levy. We are now going to raise that to 4 per cent. By the year 2002 it will be at least 9 per cent, and we all know that it is a secret of the Government that it would like to have it at 12 per cent. For this nation to achieve in that many years productivity increases of up to 12 per cent is at best a hopeful objective. It certainly has not been the basis for productivity increases in this country over the last decade. One thing is certain: while the industrial relations policy of this Government remains in place it is unlikely to increase significantly despite all the talk that we have heard from Ministers in this place, in the Senate and elsewhere over the years about the achievements of this Government in terms of productivity&mdash;which, as I said, are extremely low&mdash;and its general approach to industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the House is going to support the view that the Industrial Relations Act should be amended, that superannuation contributions should become part of the normal arrangements by which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission determines wages and terms and conditions, we believe quite strongly that this should be on the basis of at least taking account of the level of productivity in place, because that is closely linked to the point I made earlier about the capacity of industry to pay. If that capacity is not there, the inexorable outcome has to be that people will cut their costs of production, and the easiest way to cut production costs is to cut the jobs of the men and women of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been looking forward to speaking on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke earlier on this Bill. As usual, his views on industrial relations are distinct from those on this side of the House. He made quite clear the continuing attitude of the Opposition to industrial relations compared to the Government's. I believe that the Government has a very proud record in the industrial relations arena since it came to office in 1983. During that time, with the cooperation of the trade union movement&mdash;and the only way to achieve good, sensible industrial relations is in cooperation with the trade union movement&mdash;we have achieved much. Through the accord, we have a wages policy which is second to none throughout the world. It has provided stable industrial relations in this country. That is proven by our strike records compared with those in a whole range of countries throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can stand very proud of what we have achieved in the industrial relations arena. The Bill before the House tonight goes a bit further towards actually protecting the rights of workers. We often take for granted what contractors are. In a statement on what the Bill is all about, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains three distinct elements relating to independent contractors. Some of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the Bill arises from a lack of comprehension of how these provisions are framed and are intended to operate. A preliminary point should be made . . . that an independent contractor is an individual performing work under a contract for services.</PARA>
<PARA>He wanted to make that point quite clear. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not mean an incorporated body, as many contractors are. It means an ordinary individual. The legislation was deliberately framed in that way because it is such people who are commonly subjected to the type of unfair treatment that this Bill is designed to address.</PARA>

Unfortunately, as time goes on, I see the honourable member for Bennelong lean further towards the views of the likes of the former Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen.

There will be a couple of big issues&mdash;this one and the Opposition's consumption tax.

In many cases the workers are now pleased to make a worthwhile contribution because the work practices are extremely important to them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Work satisfaction is very important to employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong suggested before that the Government has changed this and that and that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has walked away from commitments to our industrial relations policies. That is just wrong. We have never walked away from them. We have reformed and changed the policies because we accept that there has to be change. There will be change in any society. If we do not accept change, we will stagnate. There is little doubt that those opposite want us to go back 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions were formed in this country to protect workers rights. Had the employers done the right thing in the first place there would not be any need for unions. One of the points that the honourable member for Bennelong made was that all men and women have a right to strike a pay rate with their employers. One can imagine what sort of chaos that would cause even in a medium-sized industry, let alone a large industry, if each individual employee had to strike a rate of pay with the employer. Surely, it is better practice to have an award rate of pay and to know the conditions that one is required to work under than to have individual wage rates. What happens in the latter situation&mdash;and it happens in America&mdash;is that people are exploited. That is the idea of it. One employee is set off against another. People are not allowed to tell each other how much they earn, with the fear of dismissal hanging over them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers of this country do have a big commitment to this country because it is what they stand up for. They love this country and they like working for it. They like to see things being achieved. But we do not like to see people exploited.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember many years ago when a woman I knew who had been out of the work force for many years wanted to come back into it. She went to a lot of trouble to get back into the work force. When she finally found employment, the employer wanted to offer her work as some sort of a contractor, to avoid taxation for a start. As a small business the employer would not have had to pay payroll tax anyway, but he wanted that cash in hand arrangement in order, he said, to benefit both of them. But it would not really have benefited the worker at all because she would have been working for an extremely low rate of pay. As far as taxation is concerned, that employee had a responsibility to declare that money as income, but the employer wanted to name her as some sort of contractor. I remember that situation very well. They are the sorts of things that we need to protect against. That is what this legislation is all about:  to protect the rights of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is one of the most unnecessary and divisive pieces of legislation to come before this House in many years. The Bill has been very cleverly written. Despite the denials of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), this Bill contains a hidden agenda, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) so ably put it. Like other members on this side of the House, I have received many representations on this Bill. The petition that I presented to the House in the last few weeks, asking that the rights of contractors be protected, gathered hundreds of signatures in a very short space of time from people who supported it because they were very concerned about the implications of this legislation&mdash;unlike the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) who is leaving the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hidden agenda that is contained in the Bill is the desire of the Government and its mates in the ACTU for union coverage to be extended to the presently largely non-unionised sectors of the economy. That is the bottom line of the legislation and that is the approach of the Minister and the Government to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic building and road transport haulage sectors are important examples. There are more than 810,000 self-employed and independent contractors&mdash;an important 15 per cent of the work force. The ACTU is aware that forecasters, such as Syntec, have recently commented that parts of the Australian economy where job numbers will grow the fastest over the next few years include some where the smallest percentage of employees or contractors belong to unions. Again, that is why the Government is very worried. The household services sector and the agriculture related sector are two such areas where Syntec thinks there will be a development in numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU is aware of the potential for more membership fees to flow in to reverse the trend towards falling union membership levels, which has seen only 31 per cent of workers in the private sectors stay as union members. That is a very important figure for members of this House and people in the electorate to remember and understand. This figure has dropped from approximately 47 per cent in 1983 when the ex-President of the ACTU, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came to power. Under his regime, the number of people in the trade union movement has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impetus for the legislation came largely from the cases heard in the Federal Court and the High Court in relation to Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters successfully sued the Building Workers Industrial Union, of which the present Minister for Industrial Relations is a former official. Immediately the Troubleshooters decision was handed down, Senator Cook commented that the law was an ass. Troubleshooters was found to have a legal right to trade and the BWIU was found to have been trying to prevent the company trading. Members of this House would be aware of the ramifications of that case. The upshot of the Troubleshooters case is that the BWIU has collected a $10 levy from each of its members this year to pay the damages awarded to Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters should be given the recognition it deserves by the Australian public for refusing to bow to union thuggery and intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has repeatedly claimed that the Government's withdrawal of proposed new section 127A from the Bill before the Senate will mean that independent contractors now have nothing to fear. That is what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table, and the Minister have been suggesting. What the Government was trying to do in relation to proposed new section 127A was give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction over the contractors. That is the thrust and the bottom line of the legislation. The Commission could consider in the now deleted proposed new section 127A:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the use or proposed use of independent contractors on the development of the skills of workers in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that contractors generally are as skilled as workers who are paid daily because of the risks involved in operating their own business. If one is a contractor, one has to continually consider the most efficient way to make one's living and meet strict quality standards to protect one's reputation in order to get the next job. That is a very clear understanding of what subcontractors are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission was also to be given the power to consider the custom and practice of the industry in relation to the use of contractors. This would have meant an easy opening for the union movement. Whether or not other sections of the Bill say that a union must already have an on-site member if it is to be a party to any proceedings, we all know that many union organisers are expert at nodding or winking and getting their way without strict legal compliance. The Industrial Relations Commission was also to be allowed, under the now deleted proposed new subsection 127A(1)(iii), to look at `the total remuneration of an independent contractor' and whether it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is or is likely to be less than the total remuneration that would be payable to an employee if the employee performed that work.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the whole argument in the Troubleshooters case. As the honourable member for Bennelong said quite rightly, Troubleshooters proved that the independent contractors received more remuneration than the award workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw some parts of the Bill to the attention of the House very quickly, because time is limited. The remaining proposed new subsection 127B(4) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviewing the contract, the Commission may have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the relative strength of the bargaining positions of the parties to the contract and, if applicable, any persons acting on behalf of the parties;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a suggestion that the union movement can become involved. Proposed subsection 127B(4)(b) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commission may have regard to. . . whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, a party to the contract;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a suggestion that union interference could occur. Proposed subsection 127B(4)(c) talks about the development of the skills of employees and (d) talks about whether the contract provides total remuneration. The final proposed subsection 127B(4)(e) talks about any other matters that the Commission thinks are relevant. What a wide ambit this Bill has to ensure the union movement becomes involved. That was the up-front intent of the Government and one can see exactly what has been retained in proposed section 127B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the real world operates is that union intimidation can often be of a verbal nature or expressed in some code form. For instance, a company doing contract work in my electorate found that, for a time, it could not receive its normal supplies. It turned out that some months previously it had declined an offer to join a union involved in its particular activities, so the wholesaler was prevented from supplying the company with materials. Once the Industrial Relations Commission has considered even a handful of cases, precedents will be created and there will be, in those ominous words so often used in industrial relations, a `flow-on effect' or, as the lawyers often say, industrial reality will be the key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Housing Industry Association has said, the Bill will inhibit the rights and freedoms of business to conduct its operations in a truly commercial manner. The HIA has been attacked repeatedly by the Minister for Industrial Relations. It has some very legitimate concerns. As Dr Ron Silberberg, the Executive Director, says, the HIA has already been joined in its $5m advertising campaign against this Bill by the National Farmers Federation. Mr Silberberg goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what we object to vigorously are the provisions of the Bill which seek to make commercial contracts subject to interference by unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than judicial judgment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key. The HIA then talks about the removal of proposed section 127A, which I have talked about. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the . . . removal . . . has been shown to represent no concession at all. It will remain open for unions to initiate, or threaten, a dispute over the terms of a commercially negotiated contract . . . A union inspired standard for terms and conditions . . . will have been set for the whole industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: why should an industrial tribunal be given the power to look at what are essentially contractual arrangements between two consenting parties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill fails to define what a sham contract is; however, time prevents me from going into that argument any further. Why should the Industrial Relations Commission be able to look at a contract and consider whether it is likely to provide more or less remuneration for the contractor? The 810,000 self-employed and independent contractors operating in Australia largely accept the risk and reward trade-off for their activities as independent contractors. If they did not, the independent contractors in the domestic building sector would have deserted that field years ago for the relative security offered by the commercial building sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government cleverly constructed this Bill so that if one part had to be abandoned, as we have seen has occurred in the other place with proposed new section 127A, another part could act as an effective substitute, as has been the case with proposed new section 127B. Rather than seeking to subtly undermine the position of contractors in the Australian economy, the Government should be opening up unions to competition by insisting that voluntary agreements between individual employees and their employers should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, even as amended, must stand condemned for its indirect attack on the rights of independent contractors, whose largely efficient system of organisation should receive bouquets rather than brickbats from the centralist Minister for Industrial Relations of the Keating Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With a little over six of his 30 minutes speaking time remaining, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) actually conceded that he might address the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. Before that we had a long pontification about the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The honourable member for Bennelong went on to congratulate the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister, the current Premier, for his role in `bypassing the union movement' in relation to that State's legislation. Of course, that was somewhat contradictory to the facade, the image, that he later contrived in his contribution when he said, `I have never said the unions are always wrong; I have never said that the employers are always right'. As I said, the reason given by the honourable member for Bennelong for congratulating the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister was that the Minister  had  totally  bypassed  the  union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong talked about the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister, John Fahey. He took minimal interest in the Bill. It is interesting to note that when the Minister, who did such a chivalrous job of undermining workers' conditions and bypassing the union movement, dealt with the question of unfair contracts,  the issue that is of such concern to many of those opposite, he failed to amend the New South Wales legislation. He brought in a very substantial list of draconian measures to undermine those conditions, but he actually continued with the provision under section 88F which is largely replicated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the history of section 88F in the New South Wales legislation, we find that it was of such breadth that it allowed the union movement to initiate cases. A case in which I was involved, one concerning Wilson Parking, went to the Privy Council; it shows that we need to deal with this question of independent contractors. It is not because of some problem in the building industry with one company, Troubleshooters, but because of what is happening in a number of widespread industries in this country, because of the difficulties in establishing the control test, and because we have fairly significant unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That lends itself to the undermining of conditions and the construction of sham contracts. I notice that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) said that they were not defined in this Bill. I think he must have been a little busy on other matters of late because I found that in proposed new section 127B there is a list of the sorts of things that will be dealt with in regard to what is unfair: the relative bargaining strength of the parties; the presence of undue pressure; the situation in relation to maintenance of skills and training. There are a few indicators as to what the Government means by sham contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the New South Wales State Government sees some benefit in the legislation that the Government is introducing tonight to tackle unfair contracts. Typical of the realities rather than the rhetoric from the Housing Industry Association is that, as people might be aware, its arguments have been undermined by the Master Builders Association, which publicly repudiated fallacious claims about a possible increase in housing costs because of this legislation. The Housing Industry Association has been dynamited into the air by other building groups which say that this is just a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any builder were to come forward and blame increases in housing costs on these changes, it would be ridiculous. The reality is best put by CCH&mdash;the bible of industrial relations&mdash;which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many situations, avoidance of the employment classification is solely for the benefit of the principal/employer and may be to the detriment of the worker. Avoidance of workers' compensation premiums, award rates of pay and conditions are some of the motivating factors in this regard. The uncertainty of the application of the employment tests leads naturally to an intelligent reticence on the part of many potential litigants to challenge the purported status of their work contracts. Unfair contracts legislation is an alternative remedy for some disadvantaged directly or indirectly by employment contracts cast into the form of independent contracts. Rather than directly challenge the classification claimed by the principal it may be a wiser alternative to argue in the appropriate forums that the contract is unfair and should be varied or set aside.</PARA>
<PARA>The real situation is that in widespread parts of industry, not just on a few building sites or in the cottage industry, these contracts are constructed with the sole purpose of avoiding award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting part of the contribution by the honourable member for Bennelong was when he said, `We are not tyrants; we will give some minimum conditions in awards or in industrial relations in this country. We are not as bad as New Zealand. We will guarantee long service, annual leave, hourly rates, et cetera'. I do not know why there has been biblical approval for these industrial relations conditions. The only point that the honourable member for Bennelong contributed was that the Opposition would keep these conditions because the public would not cop its getting rid of them. Those opposite will protect those conditions because the public will not let it undermine them. That is the rationale between what should and should not be undermined by these minimum rates that will be in the Opposition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong also went on about how Mr Gyles had made some comments about the BWIU. Those comments must have been made during the jottings that Mr Gyles was doing in his inquiry into the BWIU while he was constructing the rather unsuccessful defence of the former New South Wales Premier before ICAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was described by the honourable member for Bennelong as a moth-eaten relic of what the Government started out with. As a person on the other side of the industrial relations debate, I am quite happy with the outcome of this legislation. I think the question of the reasonableness of these unfair contracts will have some importance for industrial relations in this country. I do not think it is moth-eaten. I do not think it is unimportant. I think it does matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the credibility of the honourable member for Bennelong is all that great in industrial relations. He spent most of his 30-minute speech concentrating on the Opposition's policy. Those opposite are fairly embarrassed of late because the Premier of Tasmania&mdash;a person with slightly more electoral success than the honourable member for Bennelong has had&mdash;has indicated that the one thing he finds pathetic in the Federal parliamentary scene, the thing that he really cannot live with, is the constant obsessional support given to employers by those opposite in every industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throwaway lines about how when those opposite get into power they will do something about the barristers and the architects, et cetera, do not stand up to the light of day. When we look at the Opposition's record in a variety of administrations in States around this country where the coalition has been in power, in some cases for 30 years, we find that it did nothing about the controls that people exercise over their own jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right to start talking about compulsory unionism, et cetera. It is all right to throw away a few lines about how those opposite will get tough on other bodies, but the fact is that they have shown an absolutely inept endeavour&mdash;even when they have been interested&mdash;to do anything about the situation. That was most recently demonstrated in relation to the conveyancing laws in New South Wales, where the Minister was repudiated by the Caucus for daring to make a move in this area, and there was no result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, other measures in this Bill relate to the question of underpayment of wages. Once again, this largely repeats the New South Wales legislation. The amount goes up to a limit of $5,000. Someone on our side said that the figures were minor. Quite frankly, up to $5,000 for the individual worker can be a significant amount. I see this as a fairly important step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also noteworthy that there will be an attempt to limit the involvement of the legal fraternity to give the adjudicator the right to amend applications where there are minor problems and to make this jurisdiction a fairly liberal one in the way that it handles evidentiary matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of enterprise agreements, once again we have great predictions from the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;a man with a pretty abysmal track record in predictability, as we saw in the Burnie dispute. Once again he is of the view that this will not encourage agreements in this country. I think even most of those opposite would have a bit of difficulty associating themselves with that kind of argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the legislation itself do? For the first time it puts in a provision that it is an aim of the legislation to facilitate and encourage agreements. It introduces a single criterion in regard to certification and it writes in a requirement that there be a dispute settling procedure. It requires that the unions consult their membership in regard to these agreements. It talks about a single bargaining union. It ends compulsion for Full Bench approval and, of course, it liberalises the degree to which the authorities can interfere with certification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the honourable member for Bennelong would say that all these very measures, both in a legal sense and in a practical on the ground industrial relations sense, do not facilitate the spread of agreements is really a bit hard to fathom. I think those opposite are well aware that, when the rhetoric about how we want a centralised system is got rid of, the reality is being seen by everyone each day of the week. Whether perhaps the Government has been prodded to it by practical changes in the industrial environment is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical result of this legislation will certainly be to facilitate these agreements. That is of some concern to those opposite. If they were to succeed electorally, there is a system in place which does provide significant protection for workers in the context of the establishment of a system where agreements are facilitated. It will certainly make it that much more difficult for them to undermine conditions, to drive down wages and to drive down living standards because the system will be in place. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address briefly this Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. I must say that this is a bad Bill. This is draconian legislation and this Government deserves the greatest condemnation for having introduced it, for having amended it, for proceeding with it and for bringing it to this House tonight in the dying stages of these sittings of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is purely and simply a pay-off to the ACTU and in particular a pay-off to the BWIU in order to keep the mates happy. It is all about the Troubleshooters Available case. It is all about the issue of whether or not Australians shall have the right to be independent contractors and to contract their services to employers, or whether all workers in this country shall be required to be employees, shall be required to be controlled by the so-called union movement and shall be required to have their wages and conditions of employment determined by stitched up deals between Bill Kelty and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Minister has decided that the coalition is going to win the next election and he is doing everything possible to see that legislation is stitched up in advance to make it as difficult as possible for us to introduce voluntary union membership and true enterprise agreements in the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real effect of this Bill will be an increase in union power and a decrease in the value of the individual, with the resultant increasing decline nationally in productivity and in international competitiveness. That is an issue that I will return to in a moment. Despite Senator Cook's constant statements to the contrary, there has been no demand in the wider community for any legislation to deal with so-called sham contracts, except from the ACTU and particularly from the BWIU. In that respect I would like to quote from a letter to one of my constituents from Vince Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary, on 14 February this year. He began with words to the effect of, `Dear member, sorry but we have just levied you some more money'. I quote from one paragraph in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making the Troubleshooters Available type arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 May 1990, Tom McDonald, the National Secretary of the BWIU, wrote to Bill Kelty stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past experience shows that where workers work as self employed subcontractors, it is impossible to effectively unionise and organise those workers. This is why the new right is pushing the self employed subcontract arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Shame, shame! Honest to goodness, fair dinkum, fancy trying to give people the independent right to be contractors! There are two major issues in this Bill: the first relates to contractors and the second relates to section 115 certified agreements, the so-called&mdash;by this Government&mdash;enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contractors legislation will allow the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to inquire into, modify and, if necessary, disallow contracts, including contracts of employment. In my view, it is not appropriate that a quasi-legal body such as the AIRC is given the authority, the right and the legal jurisdiction to determine contracts. There are other mechanisms available if we are concerned about so-called sham contracts&mdash;attempts to move outside what we would consider to be fair practice. One mechanism would be to amend the Trade Practices Act. Another would be to amend this Bill in one section to allow a magistrate to determine whether or not a contract was sham or, very simply, to leave the Bill as it is and allow the existing Industrial Relations Act 1988 to deal with any sham contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, there really is no need for this legislation. There is no need for any contractors reform. The point of the Bill is that the AIRC can, under ACTU nudging, alter the nature of such industries as the building and construction industry. I bring to honourable members' attention proposed new section 127B(4)(d), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the contract provides total remuneration that is, or is likely to be, less than that of an employee performing similar work. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That little provision gives any union the opportunity to take along to the AIRC any subcontractor who happens to belong to the union and works in the housing industry and say, `This contract that I signed with my builder to build a house is a sham contract and it is no good because the conditions in my contract are different from what I would get if I was building a school or a hospital or a church'. Boy, are they different. We will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public interest is a criterion for review of contractors, but it is no longer a criterion for certified agreements under section 115. This is complex legislation. I must admit that we have received varying advice from industry throughout Australia regarding the amendments stitched up by Senator Cook and by the Democrats. Advice given to the Housing Industry Association is that removal of proposed section 127A will in fact widen the scope of AIRC involvement in contracts. I seek leave to table advice given to the HIA by its lawyers in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first issue is the fact that it is complex legislation. None of us on either side of the House is absolutely certain of the outcome or effects of the Bill and its absolute legality. There is only one simple solution: scrap the Bill and let us start all over again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major issue in this Bill relates to certified agreements. I will be the first to admit that there has been some relaxation of the rules for section 115 agreements, but this legislation now requires that a union must be a player. That means that it is impossible for any individual, in agreement with his employer, or any group of individuals in agreement with their employer, without the intercession of a union, to make any kind of industrial agreement with their employer and get certification from the AIRC. A union must be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point about certified agreements is that these so-called enterprise agreements are all above award agreements and overall have very little to do with the issue of productivity. This Bill is the second leg of the current attempts by the Minister to make certain that his commitments to the ACTU to help it increase its power and control over the industrial relations agenda are in fact honoured. The first leg was the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill. The second leg is this Bill. The third leg will be to reduce the impact of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act with respect to unions, but to increase penalties for companies or employers. In addition to those three legs, there is also the Remuneration Tribunal fiasco and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission now having decided that the Government holds it in such contempt that it is not sure whether it is even worth while continuing as an independent tribunal, because its independence has been so questioned by this Government and its partner, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill was a great bureaucratic nightmare that adds thousands of more pages to rules and regulations in Australia and it will do absolutely nothing to reform the construction industry. It is a furtherance of the club between powerful vested interests, those being the big builders in their associations, and the unions. This Bill and the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill act to transfer major project practice in the construction industry to the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I would like to quote very briefly from the May 1992 report of the Department of Planning and Housing of the State Government of Victoria. The report stated that, if we take major contract conditions and impose them on the subcontract housing industry, some of the extra costs on housing will be superannuation, currently at $40 per week, which is way over any 3 or 4 per cent; redundancy payments of $41.60 per week; minimum site allowance of $1.35 an hour; mandatory union membership&mdash;no ticket, no start&mdash;additional site amenities; and higher labour rates for certain trades. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . bricklayers charge $450 per 1000 bricks for houses but up to $870 per 1000 under commercial rates.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1992 report on world competitiveness prepared by the World Economic Forum and the International Institute for Management Development placed us sixteenth out of 22 OECD countries. That report condemned Australia as falling behind in productivity; its management as lacking initiative, incentive and drive; and its workers as lacking any competitive nature. The Opposition comprehensively rejects the Bill. It is a bad Bill. It is draconian legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be some coincidence that this evening, whilst we are debating this legislation in the House, Channel 2 has a program going to air with Couchman doing one of his segments with our colleagues across the Tasman. It is a special New Zealand broadcast looking at the New Zealand industrial relations legislation. A few minutes ago, when I was in my office collecting some documents, I noticed some of the things being said on air by workers, unions, employers and politicians about industrial relations in New Zealand&mdash;an industrial relations experiment which the Liberal-National Opposition has taken great interest in and which it has espoused as a model upon which we should design our own future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that during the discussion this evening on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Couchman</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>program, time and again the workers commented that, when it comes to deciding their conditions of employment under an unfettered bargaining process, such as is proposed by the Opposition in Australia, they do not have any bargaining power and they are completely powerless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some mention was made of a Christchurch carpet yarn company dispute, which ran for some months. There was a strike, followed by a lock-out, followed by the starvation of workers back in to sign contracts. In the course of signing those contracts a meeting was held, and the rhetoric sounded familiar to the APPM dispute which we have just witnessed in this country. The rhetoric emanating from the Christchurch dispute was about the rights of the employers to talk freely to their own employees, without the interference of union officials and the right of freedom of choice&mdash;many of the things we have heard this evening from honourable members opposite and which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has often referred to both inside and outside this place. Yet, when it all boils down, those workers at the Christchurch carpet yarn company were starved back into contracts. In the end, most of them signed a contract without their bargaining agent being present, at one of those `freely chosen meetings' those opposite like to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great tragedies of this debate is that the Opposition has sought to cloak its policies in terms of the freedoms and rights of individuals. As I have had cause to mention in this place before, the freedom those opposite talk about is not a freedom to improve conditions of employment. Under the provisions of awards and agreements now in place&mdash;even before these amendments broadened the scope; even before these amendments take effect&mdash;the opportunities exist now for employers and employees at individual workplaces to negotiate agreements, but to do it with a minimum base rate guaranteed by reference to the Industrial Relations Commission. The freedom is there now to negotiate those things, and honourable members opposite know that only too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only freedom that does not exist now is for people to breach the minimum conditions. The only freedom an employer does not have now is to try to pay his workers less money than the minimum base rate set by the Commission, by agreement or any other means. But the Opposition would have us believe that there is a great body of Australian workers out there clamouring for the freedom to work for less money; clamouring for the freedom to give up their sick leave, long service leave, accouchement leave, study leave, overtime rates, holiday leave loading and a whole range of other entitlements. That is the freedom that the Opposition has spoken about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Couchman</EMPHASIS> the myth was blown open when he had a look at the reality of the New Zealand experiment. There is no freedom in the negotiating process when only one side has power. In a negotiating process, there is no bargaining where an individual employee negotiates with the employer. For genuine bargaining to occur, there either has to be a final umpire to whom one can take the issue or there has to be some equality of leverage on each side. An employee has very little leverage at all on his own in an organisation when confronted with the company on the other side of the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the leverage employees have is twofold: firstly, acting collectively through their agent, the trade union movement; and, secondly, acting in the knowledge that, if an impasse occurs, the matter can go before an umpire&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has adopted a policy which says that employees no longer have recourse to those two things. It is important that those opposite understand some of the things their policy says. I am not sure that all of them do. The Opposition's policy says, quite clearly, that one can have recourse to the umpire&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;only if the boss agrees. It must be award determination by agreement. Employer and employee have to agree to go to the umpire; they have to agree to go to the arbiter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now that is not the case. If either party feels that an impasse has been reached, that there is a wall in front of them they do not think they can get around, they can go to the umpire, the Commission, and have the matter resolved there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite would deny workers the opportunity to have recourse to an umpire. That is their policy. I have yet to hear anyone from the Opposition tell us how that enhances the rights and freedom of Australian workers. That is because it does not. No amount of glossy rhetoric that those opposite can cloud this issue in will go to alleviating that problem which their policy creates for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill sets out to make a number of enterprise agreements easier to enter into and tries to free up the system a little, but it does it in a way which maintains an element of equity, justice and social consideration. It is not saying, `Let's throw it to the open winds and let the fittest survive'; it is saying, `Certainly there has to be some enterprise bargaining and there has to be a greater acknowledgment of the wherewithal of the enterprise to pay'. That cannot be done in a vacuum. It cannot be done without regard for what it does to the quality of life and standard of living of the people affected. We cannot hope to protect those things with talk about the marketplace fixing it, because it will not. Historically, it has not anywhere in the world. The only way we can do that is to say that, if things go off the rails, either party can go to the umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a bottom line which this country sets as the minimum standard no matter what occupation a person is in and no matter where he or she works. That minimum standard is enforced by having a commission and by having the rights of employers represented by employer unions and the rights of workers represented by employee unions. When it is all boiled down, that is the major difference between what we are doing to enhance workplace reform and what those opposite are about. They are about the law of the jungle and letting the cards fall where they may. Under the Opposition's policy it is inevitable that the cards will fall in favour of the powerful and the rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evening some mention has been made of the building industry. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) sought to draw an analogy between the costs involved in major construction and those involved in housing. Whilst he did not say it, I think the clear inference was, `Look out. If this legislation goes through, the cost of laying bricks will go from $450 a thousand to $800 a thousand'. Let us put that to rest, because that is one of the scare campaigns that members of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Corangamite, who is at the table, tells me that that is the Opposition's position. Let us get the record straight, because that is one of the furphies the Opposition has tried to peddle in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There we have it: the Opposition is on the record as saying that that is what will occur. The Master Builders Association has now publicly stated that that is not its view of the effects of this legislation. In a letter to the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the Executive Director of the Master Builders Association of Australia, Mr John Murray, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill now retains only a limited provision allowing the Industrial Relations Commission to review individual harsh and unconscionable contracts at the request of the contractor involved&mdash;a provision similar to, but narrower than, those which already exist in NSW, SA and Queensland industrial legislation, and which have been operating for some years without any ill effects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that these provisions will increase housing costs.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have the Master Builders Association putting to rest the sort of misleading comment that the Opposition has been peddling about housing costs. If the Opposition was really concerned about housing costs, it might like to say something about what its policy will do about it. It might have forgotten that its GST will increase the cost of housing by about 3 or 4 per cent&mdash;$2,000 to $5,000 on the cost of housing because of the Opposition's GST policy. That is real; there is no doubt about that. Even its mates in the Housing Industry Association will tell it that, but it tries to say, `It really doesn't mean too much, it's only a couple of thousand dollars'. There is a bit of politics being played there and both the Opposition and myself know that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes down to this industrial legislation, let there be no misunderstanding: what is contained in this Bill concerning contractors is narrower than that which has been in the State legislation in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia for years. The Master Builders Association has said that without any ill effects our legislation will not increase the cost of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are short of time this evening and there are a lot of Bills that have to be dealt with. Time will not allow me to go through the other matters of importance, but I am sure these issues will be debated often between now and the next election and I look forward to those future debates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I was about to take on personally the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), your predecessor in the chair, on the issue of his rather disparaging implications in relation to the relationships that I enjoy with the people I employ. I would simply like to respond by saying that I do consult, I do respect and I always err on the side of generosity in my dealings with them. On that basis, we get along extraordinarily well. They would pay tribute to that if they had an opportunity to do so. I reject his implications out of hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), New Zealand is not Australia. Since he has challenged us to read our policy, I might challenge him to do the same. We intend giving people choice. If they really must remain within the centralised system and all that that implies, they will have that right. If the honourable member is going to sound off about New Zealand, perhaps he might also reveal some of the other interesting information that is arising out of that place. In half of the contracts that have been signed so far, union representation has been involved. Sixty-five per cent of the contracts that have been signed have involved pay increases and 30 per cent have involved the maintenance of pay levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to that the fact that New Zealand has been recording its first trade surpluses over the last couple of months since 1973 and we see that New Zealand is not quite as easily dismissed as the honourable member would like to have us believe it is. I simply ask him, as a member of the Government: how long are we going to have to wait with the Government's policies before we see that critical question of our trade imbalance turned around?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that nobody, with the exception of the BWIU, the ACTU and those opposite, really believes the promises made about this package, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. In fact, the vast majority of people out there who know anything about it seem to believe that the aggregate effect of the package before us will involve the production of more regulation, more inflexibility and a greater role for the trade union movement at precisely the time when the opposite is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is predictable that the union movement, and the BWIU in particular, which has a great input into this whole deal&mdash;an input greatly facilitated by the fact that it has a former member as the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations in this place, Senator Cook&mdash;would disagree, and it does. The BWIU has been deeply concerned about subcontractors in the building industry for a long time. There are about 40,000 of them. There is quite a bit of money involved, apart from anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be a source of great concern to the BWIU and those opposite that labour productivity, quality of workmanship, cost and the remuneration levels of the contractors&mdash;the workers involved as contractors&mdash;are all better in the non-unionised housing industry than they are in the construction side of the industry. Instead, it is perceived by the BWIU and its mates as a threat, not a challenge to do better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Building Workers Industrial Union and its mates&mdash;presumably including those in the Government&mdash;would prefer to see the notorious inefficiencies, rorts, cost overruns, time overextensions and what have you that are common in Australia's construction industry extended to the house building sector. I will come to the point that the honourable member for Brisbane made a moment ago about Mr Murray and his claim that the HIA is going over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that that option is evidently preferable to the alternative of accepting the challenge of transferring the outstanding performance of the house building industry to the construction sector. By the mob opposite's own reckoning, their own figuring, that would reduce construction costs by 20 per cent. Their ex-Prime Minister said so just before Christmas. But no, the BWIU, seeing the threat to its power and to its finances, insisted that something be done about it. Those 40,000 contractors could be contributing up to $12m a year at current rates; and worse, if workers really catch on that they can get a better deal without representation, in a lot of cases they might want out. The Troubleshooters case, in which it failed to secure its interests via the law, convinced that union and the ACTU that it should lean on the Federal Government for help in rebuilding union domination by legislative means. That is what this package is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very real and worrying sense, what is before us is more the product of union objectives than government objectives. It needs to be remembered that the union movement is having trouble convincing people in the workplace that it is entirely relevant. Although 85 per cent of workers work under awards, only around 30 per cent of the private sector now bother signing up with a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hidden objective in this package is to entwine independent contractors into the web of union power and union dominance. That power and position would, needless to say, be greatly enhanced by the additional revenue that might be raised. It is estimated that nationwide there could be up to a million contractors. Again, at current average membership rates, if those contractors could be encouraged by one means or another to join a union, as they would be facilitated and encouraged to do by this package before us tonight, we could be looking at $300m worth of additional revenue for the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do the amendments propose to achieve these objectives? By three essential methods: giving the Commission power to review unfair contracts for the performance of work by independent contractors; allowing the Commission power to prevent or settle disputes over the use of independent contractors; and allowing unions to enrol contractors by opening union membership to individuals as well as to employers. I suggest that by this means the traditional common law right of contract in this area will be virtually broken, unnecessarily and unwisely. The power to represent independent contractors before the Industrial Commission will increase the coverage, power and influence of unions. There can be no real doubt about that, nor can there be any real doubt that that is the objective of this whole package. This presupposes that the Commission will be given jurisdiction to determine claims made by independent contractors. That is, of course, a major feature of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the technicalities for a moment, it is of very deep concern to me that, by virtue of the deletion of section 127A, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission may well be less fettered in its capacity to review contracting arrangements. This is the point the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) came to, and I want to back him in his concerns, despite the objections raised by the honourable member for Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission, by virtue of the removal of section 127A, will not have to take into consideration in the exercise of its jurisdiction the five criteria set out in that section in relation to independent contractors. This means that when the Industrial Relations Commission reviews a contract as to whether it is unfair, harsh or against the public interest, it has no criteria for review but may take account of specific matters and any other matter, which presumably means that there will be no real limits on the review power of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is correct, the amendments may well prove, when all of this is tested, to be far wider than even the Government had predicted and hoped for. Frighteningly, that raises the potential that a set of standard contracts very possibly instituting restrictive and expensive work practices will soon emerge as precedents based on accumulated cases build up. This is at the heart of the Housing Industry Association's concerns in this instance. It has estimated that there is a possibility of something like a $15,000 rise in the price of an average Australian house. That has been well publicised; it is out there in the public arena. I put it to the House that it is contemptible that the Housing Industry Association, as a responsible and respected organisation, should see its excellent work and its very real concerns arising out of that work discounted so cheaply, dismissed in a barrage of abuse and, where possible, ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not alone in its concerns, and I think it is critical to note that. The CAI submission to the Senate Committee contained some interesting warnings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You could hardly call the BWIU independent. I want to record the following, which is from the CAI submission:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note the potential of the three tests in this provision (unfair, harsh or against the public interest) to be used to dramatically extend the reach of the award system of regulation in this country. The New South Wales Industrial Commission has on occasion used a simple numerical comparison of the total amount received by an award employee and an independent contractor and seen this to be sufficient to satisfy this test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in Minister for Youth and Community Services (1991) . . . Cahill decided that relief under the New South Wales equivalent provision should be granted as the total remuneration received by an independent contractor houseparent responsible for the care of children the Department placed with her was less than a person performing the work as an employee would have received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, in Assal versus Kater . . . Glynn J. decided that a cleaning business provided for a total remuneration less than that which a person performing the work of an employee would have received under the relevant award, which was held to be against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions will not only dramatically extend the influence of awards in setting rates for independent contractors, but may also extend the influence of awards in determining how work is performed. For example, awards have a very substantial influence on patterns of work, including the hours of the day, days of the week, and the number of hours per week, by for example requiring penalty rates outside certain hours to be paid. Many of these restrictions simply reflect the history of the particular area, having been granted decades ago and simply continued in force thereafter, rather than modern competitive requirements. Independent contractors not bound by such provisions could perform work at different hours, at different cost.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Murray of the MBA might have done well to have had a good look at that before he made his pronouncements yesterday. The amendments are also supposed to facilitate the smoother passage of certified agreements. We on this side of the House would accept the need for such an outcome, but we would raise real doubts as to the likelihood of that eventuating as a result of this package. For a start, despite the partial exclusion in section 134E, in many cases an agreement cannot be ratified without the agreement of at least one union in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing the power of the Commission to refuse certification on public interest grounds, and insisting for the first time that a union should be involved, except in the case where there is no union representation on the site&mdash;which is a sop, I guess, to small business&mdash;is obviously going to enhance the role and place of the more powerful unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the most objectionable sweetheart deal, objectionable so far as the public interest is concerned, or failing on any number of other tests, would have to be approved by the Commission if the union and the employer happen to agree. I do not know how workers' interests can necessarily be guaranteed by that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also raise the possibility that an excellent workplace negotiated agreement satisfactory to employees and employers could not be signed, no matter how happy employees and employers might be about it, if the union, no matter how disinterested in the outcome of the arrangements it might be, refused to sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have overstepped my time. Suffice to say that, at a time when we need to improve our flexibility, productivity and efficiency in the interests of building a decent future for all Australians, this package appears to head in precisely the wrong direction and therefore should be rejected in its entirety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the Government has lost interest in this matter, not having a speaker here to follow the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). I am delighted to take the opportunity to say a few words. I am very flattered to have both the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), both renowned or notorious trade unionists, or apologists for the trade unions, here to listen to my remarks tonight. I hope that they will listen intently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier tonight the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) put the Opposition's position succinctly and eloquently. I have not heard anything from either the honourable member for Reid or the honourable member for Brisbane that in any way changes my mind about the Opposition's intractable opposition to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has already been said during the debate about the so-called reforms. One would have to take the word `reforms' extremely literally if one wanted to read reforms into this legislation. So I take it that we are talking about reforms in a very loose sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the Government's intention with the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill is not to reform. That is patently clear. Anyone who reads or listens to this debate tonight would surely form that view. It is really much simpler than reform; it is about preserving and extending union power. I thought the remarks by the honourable member for Reid were really hollow. I do not think his heart was in it. He is a pretty honest sort of a bloke. I have served on a committee with him. I think he knows that that is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, the unions have a problem. They are becoming irrelevant. As the honourable member for Bennelong said in more or less these words earlier tonight, the average Australian worker is not so dumb after all; he or she has come to realise that there has not been very much return on the investment in union membership. In fact, most of them have decided that unless they are forced to join&mdash;only some 30 per cent of the private sector work force are in a union and most of them are in that category&mdash;they do not see any particular reason to join. I suppose the ultimate slap in the face for many of those workers who are forced to join is that they become aware that by doing so some of their membership dues are actually going to support the Labor Party. That even rubs salt into the wound. People are not only forced to join a trade union, but by virtue of that membership they are also forced to support the Labor Party indirectly, and they do not like that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The context of these reforms&mdash;I am just using that word loosely&mdash;needs to be clearly understood. This Government is dominated and controlled by the trade union movement. Martin Ferguson, the brother of the honourable member for Reid, calls it a partnership between the ACTU and the Government. It is more than a partnership. Actually, Bill Kelty and Mr Ferguson are de facto Cabinet Ministers. They are really about self-preservation. I believe most Australians quite correctly attribute many of Australia's problems today to abuses of union power. I think the honourable member would concede that point. We are not talking about the rank and file unionist who chooses to join a union&mdash;he has the democratic right to do so&mdash;and gets value for his dollar out of doing that. We are talking about abuses of union power. I could talk about plenty of examples if I had more time tonight. That is why industrial relations will be a key issue in the next election, which is just around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are very happy to fight the next election on the issue of industrial relations. We believe the realisation has dawned on most Australians that trade union bureaucrats are only about preserving their own jobs. Time and again they have demonstrated their callous disregard for the preservation of workers' jobs. How many times do we hear the argument from trade unionists that they are not prepared to forgo the hard-won gains that they have been about winning for their members over many years? That just shows them up for what they are. They would prefer to fight to maintain those practices and conditions, which they have won in a different economic environment that is no longer with us, rather than concede that some of those things should change. Many of the work practices and the benefits that we now have, such as holiday leave loadings, which I think are widely acknowledged to be an anachronism in today's environment, are evidence of that fact. Those sorts of conditions and practices were gained in different times. They were often conceded by employers who were operating between high protection barriers. It was easy in that environment for employers to concede&mdash;and they did time after time&mdash;and they were simply able to pass on those costs to whoever was going to pay. It was very often ultimately the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) when he introduced this Bill in its original form in the Senate. The speech talks a lot about democracy, yet this Bill seeks to further proscribe it. One important element of democracy is surely the right to engage in free enterprise, yet this Bill attempts to limit that right. For a variety of reasons, some work&mdash;on construction sites, for example&mdash;is carried out by contractors. This is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement for both the contractor and the builder or developer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is being carried out in the shadow of the APPM dispute at Burnie, which was surely one of Australia's most bitter, even violent, industrial disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not. On the contrary, we are not sad. That is a reflection on us. We do not want industrial disputation for the sake of it. We have nothing to prove. The Government was pointing the finger at us throughout that dispute and saying that we were sitting on the sidelines egging on APPM and hoping that it would be successful because that was somehow going to demonstrate that what the Government incorrectly regards as our approach to industrial relations was going to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that those opposite saw it as an opportunity to sheet home to us something that was not the truth. That reflection seriously misrepresents our intentions. What we are ultimately about in our industrial relations policy is ensuring that the process of reform is speeded up. It must be speeded up. The Government's approach to waterfront reform, for example, shows just how slow reform can be if it is dictated by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will talk about Burnie for a moment. I do not want to take up too much time tonight because some of my colleagues also want to speak on this Bill. In Burnie, the union's major victory was in ensuring that it continued to play a role in workplace reform. I believe that APPM may have been ill advised to preclude this right from the start. However, the decision was made in the face of a difficult financial situation, exacerbated by a raft of unreasonable arrangements and practices which had previously been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is unreasonable or even impractical not to have unions involved, particularly in large workplaces such as the one at Burnie. However, ultimately the right climate must exist in the workplace. We on this side of the chamber want to achieve what Dr Hewson has described as a generational change in industrial relations&mdash;away from confrontation towards cooperation. Trust is a key element in achieving workplace reform. This was clearly missing at Burnie and it will be for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, an important result of the APPM dispute which, from our perspective, is obviously fundamental is the end of the closed shop. The company will no longer collect union dues. Importantly, the company has established its right to manage. It will consult with its employees, as it ought to, but it will not negotiate with them on matters not fixed by awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up any more time because I know that others wish to speak on this Bill. We are not in any way backing away from a fight on this issue. The reform of industrial relations is absolutely fundamental if Australia is to move forward. </PARA>

The rules are all set down. I have not seen the little book but I am sure it is there.

In the Pilbara we have this amazing situation where the largest iron ore carrier ever to visit Australia is tied up at the wharf. Who is losing? The workers up there are losing wages; and the Western Australian Government, which is in a diabolical financial position, is losing royalties that it might otherwise be expending on the poor and those who are out of work through no fault of their own; all because one bloke up there does not want to join the union.

They simply are not there. If honourable members go back to Senator Cook's correspondence file they will not find one letter from a proper subcontractor saying, `Please protect me, Senator. I need your help'. Subcontractors do not exist only in the building trades. That very successful boat building industry that goes with the crayfish industry in Western Australia is carried out by subcontractors. They do not earn the basic wage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), who is at the table, does not have control of this legislation, which is a pity because, at the conclusion of the debate, I would like a question answered. In my State it is quite a common practice for young couples to save money for a house, go directly to the subcontractors and ask them to build their home. The Minister for Land Transport, in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unfair contract review procedure will allow a party to a contract that is harsh, unfair or against the public interest to apply to the Commission for its review. Where the Commission is of the opinion that the contract is harsh, unfair or against the public interest, it will be able to vary or set aside the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Consumer Affairs might ask me what happens to a young couple who go to the bank, having obtained contracts from a concrete worker, a bricklayer and the various other subcontracting trades involved in building a home, aggregated the contracts and said to the bank, `We want to take out a mortgage for $50,000 to build our home according to these contracts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage of the game the bank would approve that, but what happens if one or two of those subcontractors cart that young couple off to the Industrial Relations Commission at the conclusion of the job and say that the contractual arrangement is unfair and not even in the public interest? If that young couple appear before a commissioner who happens to be a one-time trade union bureaucrat, will they find&mdash;and I think the Minister should answer this&mdash;that they have to go back to the bank and borrow another $10,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Good Friday I drove past a housing site where bricklayers were working. Is it unfair and against the public interest that they performed that work at ordinary time? It was clearly their personal choice, but is that a situation where those subcontractors can say, `Because I agreed to lay these bricks in two weeks and I should have had three, I have therefore been forced to work on Good Friday.'? Does that make the contract unfair and unconscionable? I do not know and I do not think the Minister knows. The Minister for Consumer Affairs might give some guarantees to the young people in my State that they will not be dragged before the Industrial Relations Commission in that situation. I bet she does not. I bet she dodges it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the circumstances that we have to question. However, the big question is&mdash;and I am obliged to close on this point&mdash;what is it all about? The industry that the Government is setting out to protect does not want its help. Not one of those people has written to the Government or protested. There are no petitions announced in this place by the Clerk. What is the Government doing it for? The Government knows what it is doing it for. It comes down to those simple words of Bill Kelty which I quoted in this place before when the IRC threw out accord mark VI. It was televised and he said, `Comrades, if we allow the IRC to get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, `Our members might be unable to feed their children'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has been in power for nine years. It is a government which brought in a new industrial relations Act in 1988 and it is a government which amended that Act in 1989, 1990 and 1991. But never before, not in any of those nine years, has this Government seen fit to regulate independent contractors in that new Act or in those amendments. The reason why in 1992, nine years after it came to power, it decided to regulate independent contractors for the first time was not that it had suddenly found out that independent contracting was being conducted on unfair, harsh or unconscionable terms; it was not that it had received complaints from independent contractors; and it was not that it had suddenly been alerted to something that was wrong in industrial relations. It was for one simple reason: the Federal Court of Australia, the Full Federal Court of Australia, and the High Court of Australia, in a case known as Odco Pty Ltd v. BWIU, found that Odco, which traded under the name Troubleshooters, had the right to trade in Australian industry, had the right to supply independent contractors to commercial building sites and had the right to be protected against the interference of trade unions and their officials which were seeking to drive it out of the industry. That is why this has happened. Because the BWIU and the other defendants were ordered to pay $420,000 in costs, with damages still to be assessed, this Government has decided to step in and try to reverse the findings of the court and the consequences that flowed from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record the fact that I know the principals of the company Troubleshooters Available, Brian Groves and Peter Bosa, because I lived with them through those court cases in the Federal Court, the Full Federal Court and the High Court, and I saw what they had to put up with and the pressure they were put under. I saw the shameful conduct of the trade unions which sought to drive them out of business and I saw them vindicated. They are fine people who went to courts of law to vindicate their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider it a shameful day, after people have gone to courts of law, have vindicated their rights and established their rights to trade freely, that this Parliament can step in and undo the consequences of those judgments. What is more, I consider it shameful that this Parliament can step in with legislation which has been prepared by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook&mdash;the superannuated BWIU official&mdash;who has used his position in this Parliament as an opportunity to reverse the courts' decisions and to do for his ex-union what he could not do in the courts by bringing the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill into this place. Never before have we seen such a naked exercise of the responsibilities of a Minister of the Crown for personal, political and associational advancement as we have seen with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Troubleshooters business provided for independent contractors the opportunity to find work on building sites and it provided for builders the opportunity to find independent contractors to work on building sites. Every one of the independent contractors who worked through Troubleshooters Available was a member of the BWIU, yet the BWIU mounted a campaign to drive them off building sites. Yes, that is right, a union mounted a campaign to drive its own members out of work. That is what occurred. The union took union funds, including the membership subscriptions of those men, in an attempt to drive them out of work. The finding of the judge in his judgment of 24 August 1989 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am satisfied, in the light of all the evidence, that the two respondent unions, along with others in the building industry, have adopted a policy of trying to prevent the applicant from operating in the industry as it presently does.</PARA>
<PARA>After the Full Court judgment came out, this superannuated ex-BWIU official who now parades as a Minister of the Crown said `The law is an ass', and he gave an understanding to those respondents that he would intervene to help them in a way that the courts had not. If the House wants proof of that, it is there in black and white in the letter of Vince Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary, of 14 February 1992 in which he told members of the union that they were all going to have a $10 levy imposed on them. Remember that it is no ticket, no start, so nobody had a choice as to whether they would pay this levy. They all had to pay the $10 levy to make up the costs the union had lost in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Vince Raffa wrote to the members and told them `Yes, you are all in for $10 to cover the costs we lost trying to drive our own members out of work in the industry', he said, `We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making the Troubleshooters Available type of arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act'. There it is in black and white. Vince Raffa on 14 February 1992 said, `We have got it. We may have lost it in the courts; we may have broken the rules; we may have tried to drive our own members out of work; we may have lost $420,000; we may have to levy you all $10; but don't worry about it because the Federal Government is going to intervene to render this illegal'. That is the conclusion of Vince Raffa, in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Raffa was saying was, `We have the ultimate umpire. If the law is against us and we break the law, we just call in the ultimate umpire and we change the rules'. It is like the tennis player who loses a point and says, `I have got the man who makes the rules of tennis. I am going to change the rules so that now when I hit the ball outside the boundaries, it is in for me'. Vince Raffa was saying, `Don't worry about it. We do not have to obey laws. There is nothing as mundane or prosaic as the observing of laws by trade unions. We control the umpire. We'll just change the rules'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell those opposite another fact they ought to bear in mind. It was always said in this case that the reason the unions were against Troubleshooters was that Troubleshooters was paying people below the awards once all the benefits were cashed out. When I had the State Secretary in the court and he was asked to produce the figures that showed that Troubleshooters independent contractors were being paid less than the award, what did we find? He had never done</PARA>
<PARA>the figures. He had never ever done the calculation. He had gone out on a campaign for a couple of years to try to drive them out on the basis that they were undercutting awards, but he had never done the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they called in Arthur Andersen and led the evidence, what did we find? After every one of those benefits was cashed out, they were being paid above awards for tradesmen and equal to awards for labourers although, as the judge said, it would vary from year to year according to the amount of work in the industry. The whole campaign was based on a falsity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That case shows that there is a mechanism in Australia to determine whether or not people are employees or independent contractors. The mechanism is in courts of law. That is an example of where that occurred and how it can occur under the current law. We do not need this Bill to do that. What we need this Bill for is to move that question out of the courts and into the Industrial Relations Commission. We like getting things out of the courts and into the Commission. The first thing this Bill will allow the Commission to do is to make an order that employees be employed rather than independent contractors retained. So the Commission will have the right, in arbitrating on an industrial dispute, to prevent such arrangements occurring in the future if a dispute arises. The Commission will have the power to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second way in which the mechanism will work is that, with the power to set terms and conditions for independent contractors to rewrite contracts, the Commission will be able to set independent contracts on such terms as to make sure there is no advantage in having independent contractors&mdash;to make sure that the independent contracts have to operate on such inflexible terms and conditions as to take away any advantage in having an independent contract. That is why Government members want to move this matter into the Commission. They want to take away the basic freedom of independent contractors to contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the Government say, `People do not have the right to fix their own terms and conditions. We want a state agency to be able to supervise it. We want a state agency to set terms and conditions for independent contractors'. Do they never think about what an independent contractor is? An independent contractor is someone who wants to work for himself. Because he wants to work for himself, he wants to set his own terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that one can be an independent contractor with no independence to set one's terms and conditions, or to be subject to state intervention in setting those terms and conditions, is a non sequitur. It is basic nonsense because, in the final analysis, the Government wants to take away that freedom; it wants to preserve the award system, it wants to preserve the control of unions. The Government does not like people being free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing the Government fears more than anything else is that independent contractors, as happened in the Troubleshooters case, will actually negotiate better terms and conditions than those in awards. That takes away the whole rationale of unionism. The real problem that the union movement had with the Troubleshooters case was that in the absence of the union they were doing better. That destroyed all of the propaganda that says that unions are the only things that stand between exploitation and the civilised community. It exposed that lie. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 established the national industrial chemical notification and assessment scheme. The Act establishes a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals which, among other things, aids in the protection of the Australian people and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government introduced the scheme, it decided that the regulatory impact on industry be reviewed after two years of operation. This review is currently in progress. This is known as the regulatory impact review. I anticipate further amendments arising from this review, aimed at minimising the regulatory impact of the scheme on industry to the extent that this is consistent with the maintenance of adequate safeguards for workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill presents a small but significant amendment to the Act. It addresses one aspect of the legislation of particular concern to industry because of its impact on product development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notifications and Assessment) Act 1989 to allow for the introduction of new industrial chemicals for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. New industrial chemicals introduced for this purpose are to be exempt from the assessment provisions of the Act. This means that importers and manufacturers may evaluate the commercial potential of a new industrial chemical without having to invest resources in preparing the detailed notification package covering the chemical's physical and chemical properties and toxicology which is currently required. The Bill enhances innovative product development by significantly reducing regulatory requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that new industrial chemicals introduced for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation have to be notified to the director of the scheme and that information on occupational health, public health and environment protection is provided. Proposed section 21A deals with the object of the commercial evaluation permit system. The object is to provide a simple means of by-passing the assessment certificate system where a new industrial chemical is being introduced for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation while ensuring that adequate safeguards are imposed. One safeguard is the provision of a material safety data sheet to the director of the scheme. This specifies any health hazards that could be caused by the chemical, the manner of handling the chemical and procedures to be adopted in the event of any emergency involving the chemical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another safeguard is to be found in clause 6 of the Bill, which subjects chemicals introduced for commercial evaluation purposes to the priority existing chemical provisions of the Act. These allow for the chemical to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that chemicals introduced under a commercial evaluation permit would normally be introduced for a period of one year only and in quantities not exceeding 1,000 kilograms and must be used for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. There is a facility to increase the amount up to 2,000 kilograms and for a period up to two years where the director is satisfied that the increased quantity and the increased time are necessary for an effective commercial evaluation. The Bill also includes a power to impose conditions and a power to revoke or vary any condition on permits granted to allow for commercial evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant penalty for a breach of the conditions on which a commercial evaluation permit is granted. As confidentiality may be an important consideration in new product development, the Bill allows an applicant the right to apply for certain information to be granted confidential status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The needs of industry are met because a manufacturer or importer of a new industrial chemical will be permitted to test the chemical with a view to ascertaining its potential for commercial application without the regulatory burden of having the chemical fully assessed. If the evaluation indicates that the chemical has a commercial market the importer or manufacturer can make an informed decision whether it is worthwhile to apply to have the chemical notified and assessed as a new chemical. In this way the Bill will remove some of the commercial risks currently associated with product development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of the Bill will show the strength of the Government's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on industry. The Bill provides an easy and cost effective way for Australian industry to extend existing markets and create new markets. By minimising the regulatory cost of developing and improving products, while maintaining safeguards, the Government is determined to create a regulatory climate which will foster industry development. This will assist in achieving the Government's micro-economic reform goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In canvassing the need for the commercial evaluation category in the Act, the Government has consulted widely. It has consulted with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies as well as the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Chemical Confederation of Australia, the Australian Chemical Industry Council, their affiliates, other industry associations not affiliated with these peak bodies, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and interested non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All parties support the amendment. Industry has sent a clear message that the new category will have benefits flowing from it. These include a proper consideration of possible risks to health and environmental matters and removal of a restraint to innovation and trade. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who would normally have carried the passage of this legislation for the Opposition, I seek to make a few remarks. We will not be opposing the legislation. As noted by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, which established the national industrial chemical notification and assessment scheme. The 1989 Act established a national system of notification assessment of industrial chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The Bill is a progression from the 1989 Act, which was intended to remove an impediment to product development which was, I might add, of great significance to Australia's rural industries. The Bill provides for the exclusion of chemicals which are being commercially evaluated from the elaborate, time-consuming and expensive assessment provisions of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the remarks made in the Senate by Senator Parer and record the coalition's agreement with the position which he set out there. The Bill has been sought by industry, and the coalition supports this reduction of regulatory burden on industry while maintaining necessary safeguards. It is a forerunner to a number of changes to improve the scheme, and I understand that the industry is quite enthusiastic about further amendments to be introduced later year. As I said earlier, the Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 31 December 1991 the ABC had a commercial agreement with the Nine Network to televise a comprehensive live coverage of the Test Cricket to all country areas. Following the implementation of an aggregated television service throughout Australia on 1 January 1992, however, PBL Marketing which controls Australian rights to local Test Cricket chose not to make the regional rights available to the ABC. Without the legal right to continue coverage of Test Cricket it is not possible for the ABC to serve those areas where the signal from the Nine Network is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has chosen not to purchase secondary or regional rights. The major problem for the ABC is splitting its satellite feeds. The North East satellite footprint does not presently allow a localised transmission pattern. The ABC is not in a position to provide "one-off" and isolated transmissions which disrupt its own schedules and transmissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is unable to provide information on QSTV's broadcasting strategy generally. In respect of test cricket, the Minister has been informed that Channel Nine sold the rights to QSTV to broadcast the last test series in full.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABC does not receive contributions per se from outside parties for the production of some of its television programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC is expressly authorised by Section 25(5)(b) of the ABC Act to enter into co-productions with bona fide producers of programs, films, sound recordings, concerts and public entertainment (including sporting events).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These co-productions often, but not always, involve the ABC receiving payments from co-producers in order to help offset its production costs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances a co-producer will necessitate the creation of particular positions which will be on a fixed-term "run of show" basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each dollar spent on program production in 1990/91, approximately 65 cents was spent on ABC labour.

Residents in rural areas not served by terrestrial transmitters have two options for reception of SBS television. The first is to install individual satellite receiving dishes. As an alternative, the Government's Self-help Broadcasting Reception Scheme (SBRS) allows community groups to fund the establishment of facilities to receive SBS from the satellite system and the retransmission of those services within a local coverage area. The Government provides financial assistance in the form of sales tax exemption for satellite receiving equipment used for this purpose. Technical assistance is also available from the Department of Transport and Communications.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The text of the declaration made by Australia on ratification of the Convention is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA furthermore DECLARES that Australia is not at present in a position specifically to treat as offences all the matters covered by article 4(a) of the Convention. Acts of the kind there mentioned are punishable only to the extent provided by the existing criminal law dealing with such matters as the maintenance of public order, public mischief, assault, riot, criminal libel, conspiracy and attempts. It is the intention of the Australian Government at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a)."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Commonwealth has had the matter under review for sometime. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its National Inquiry Into Racist Violence Report (NIRV Report) recommended that any qualification on Australia's obligations under Article 4(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination be removed. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that Governments which have not already done so legislate to proscribe racial vilification. In the response to that Report the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs noted that before legislative action can be taken, Australia would need to withdraw its reservation to Article 4(a) of the Convention. He also noted that the Government is disposed to legislate to specifically prohibit incitement to racial violence in circumstances where an appropriate link could be established between the act of incitement and the act of violence threatened or occurring. The Government will be considering the issue of racial vilification shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have legislated to prohibit racial vilification. Victoria has announced that it intends to introduce legislation to prohibit acts of racist abuse, harassment and incitement to racial hatred, South Australia is considering extending the law beyond existing discrimination prohibitions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government established the Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) in 1987 in accordance with the recommendations of a Government Inquiry into Tourism. The primary functions of the BTR are to provide a national focus for collection, analysis and dissemination of data and to conduct or coordinate research on priority issues in the tourism field. The Bureau is funded by the Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments on a 2:1 basis. Its budget in 1991/92 is $2.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the BTR undertakes a broader range of activities than pure market research, it is responsible for the conduct of the two key monitors of tourism activity in Australia, the International Visitors Survey (IVS) and the Domestic Tourism Monitor (DTM), which provide an important focus for market research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) and the State/Territory tourism authorities also conduct market research, as do major tourism operators. The ATC's market research focuses heavily on market segmentation studies of Australia's major or emerging overseas tourist markets. State and Territory tourism authorities conduct market research in both the domestic and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A broad range of tourism or tourism related research is carried out by State and Territory Government tourism authorities and by consultants on behalf of the private sector. For instance, the industry, through Tourism Training Australia (TTA), researches its training needs. The industry also undertakes research under the auspices of the Australian Tourism Research Institute and the National Centre for Studies in Travel and Tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BTR has focused on improving the quality, flexibility and responsiveness of its domestic and international visitor surveys, the provision of technical advice to government and industry, and on increasing its forecasting and analytical output. The emphasis of the ATC's activities has been on Australia's overseas tourist markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducts a comprehensive quarterly survey of tourist accommodation in Australia and other surveys of selected service industries, including tourist accommodation, travel agencies, motor vehicle hire and tourist attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) A recent evaluation of the BTR concluded that a number of areas of unmet demand needed to be addressed and the report of the Tourism Working Group on Ecologically Sustainable Development identified the need for an expansion of research to facilitate the development of an ecologically sustainable tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Additional research is needed at the local and regional level. The BTR is developing a methodological kit for regional tourism monitors, which will extend the IVS and DTM. This will ensure that the existing national surveys become more relevant and useful resources for tourism development at these levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Research on the impact of major resource projects on tourism activity in specific regions is generally commissioned by industry interests and undertaken by private consultants, as is the required environmental research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Tourism research and statistical collections undertaken by the Bureau of Tourism Research, the Australian Tourist Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and State and Territory tourism authorities are funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. Funds for research into workforce issues in the tourism industry are provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Industrial Relations. Industry contributes to the cost of research conducted by the Australian Tourist Commission and Tourism Training Australia. Universities' research activities sometimes cover tourism, while most commissioned research for the industry is carried out at the industry's expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The tourism industry has a keen interest in, and recognises the value of any research on issues related to enhancing its growth potential, including economic, environmental, social and cultural issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has in place a range of policies and programs which sustain employment through the advancement of Australia's agriculture, minerals, energy, fisheries and forestry industries. These industries are important contributors to the economy in their own right. In addition, they have strong links to other industries as well as to regional economic development and employment. The Department is also working with industry groups to assist in the development of value adding activities, particularly in early stage processing of products in which Australia has a comparative advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) and (b) The Department's approach to employment creation in the rural and resources sector is based on strengthening the international competitiveness of Australia's primary and energy industries and processing activities based on these commodities. The growth prospects of these industries, and the economy more generally, depend crucially on adequate infrastructure and efficient industrial and market structures. They are also strongly influenced by uptake of new technologies and industrial processes, based on relevant research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant proportion of the $2.3 billion increase in expenditure arising from the Government's "One Nation" strategy will be spent on improving national infrastructure.
