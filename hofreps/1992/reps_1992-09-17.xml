<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to speak on the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology from its inquiry on genetically modified organisms. Genetic engineering and the entire biological field hold the promise of a great new industry which could bring much prosperity to this nation. However, if we the people's representatives in this legislature do not set the correct guidelines, the industry will collapse under the weight of bureaucratic interference. Indeed, Australia's history reveals many examples of lost opportunities for wealth creation. We were once world leaders in agricultural engineering. Today we import almost everything, even plough discs. It is absolutely shameful that hardly a piece of agricultural equipment is made in this country today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians were amongst the pioneers in the film industry. Now we make few feature films while many of our most talented and creative film-makers are sought after by Hollywood. The early years of the century saw some remarkable advances in aviation by Australians. The geography and distances which characterise this nation make us ideally suited to pursue the development of aviation. It is an industry which we should be endeavouring to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have pioneered such things as the design of ships, chemicals, drugs, and so on: you name it; Australia has had the opportunity to be amongst the leaders. Even today I believe the most advanced car engines are made by Orbital in Perth. However, I am sure commercial production will never occur in Australia, largely because of the pathetic lack of will in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have let all these opportunities slip through our fingers mainly through government intervention, poor policy decisions and over-regulation. The recent publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian Ideas</EMPHASIS> recommends money for regulation but not money to compensate for extra costs that are inevitable as a result of regulation in this genetic engineering industry. It is money for the tail but not for the tiger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the recession, the lack of support for biological research and a general malaise in the research system, we may already be too late. It may be time to lament another lost opportunity. The de facto moratorium on many research projects whilst the guidelines are set has, in my opinion, been the final blow to this infant industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research in Australia in biotechnology has been of world standing. With limited resources, our successes have been quite remarkable. We have built up a considerable body of information, having supported biological research for a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that generally the quality and quantity of research have declined alarmingly in the last year or so. This is partly due to the lack of funding and the collapse of a number of private enterprises. Besides, who is going to do this work? It will not be business. Business in Australia is in survival mode and likely to stay that way for some years to come. It will not be universities. Like Stalin's notorious five-year plans, five years of Dawkins has almost destroyed these great academic institutions. It will not be the CSIRO as that organisation is already struggling to keep its projects flowering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research is currently necessary to investigate risk factors involved in genetic engineering. This research should be done in controlled environments which offer minimum risk to the ordinary environment. It is necessary to distinguish here between research into genetically modified organisms in controlled and strictly monitored environments and the actual release of these organisms into the open environment. It is only by doing the former that risk assessment can be made for the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This research phase is where the biotechnology industry is now&mdash;in its infancy. Consider the potential loss to Australia if research is not undertaken due to the potential fatal combination of lack of funding and over-regulation. Down the track, after other countries have done the research, what will Australia pay in licensing and in the import of such technology? What about the loss of research capabilities, skills and infrastructure in the biotechnology area? Consider the lack of application in this area of knowledge to specifically Australian problems such as the rabbit plague. If we are finding problems continuing with a reasonable level of research our development and production record is absolutely abysmal. Hardly a product we discover through research is in fact produced in Australia. This country has virtually no history of success in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This phase of taking a product and bringing it into production is extremely expensive and therefore requires large amounts of cheap long term finance. As a nation of non-savers, just spenders of savings of others, we will have to change our ways or forever forgo the tremendous advantages of making products for world markets. The present Government has an appalling record of encouraging savings. Taxes on interest earned from savings are punitive. Even worse, the deeming provisions assume quite a high level of income. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and I have at times outlined schemes for tax free interest on personal savings. The great developer-cum-producer over the last two decades, Japan, has had this form of saving for some time. Its Maruyu accounts have funded its economic miracle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What might just make the difference in this industry is the extent to which it is dominated by women, many of whom gave the Committee tremendous assistance. A number of these women, such as Professor Nancy Millis, are of enormous academic and intellectual standing. It would be tremendous if the enthusiasm and commitment of people such as Professor Millis could give the whole industry the lift it requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is important that appropriate regulations be followed, such regulations must not make it so costly that researchers find it prohibitively expensive to pursue their research. Given the pressures on precious research funds, excessive regulations will mean that researchers will not be able to obtain sufficient funds to do the work needed to find out whether there is a problem or not in respect of the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation, without the compensatory funds available to investigate whether there are any risks, is irresponsible and only establishes what amounts to a moratorium on the release of genetically modified organisms. The current system of control which uses GMAC has worked very well. The report recommends a continuing role for GMAC and further recommends that the guidelines be set in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two central issues in this field of research. Firstly, there is the question of risk assessment. Risk assessment is one central issue with these particular organisms. At this stage of biotechnology, research is necessary to establish what the risks really are. Over-regulation will discourage the research necessary and result in a de facto moratorium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the question of approval of releases. It is only in the area of approval of releases into the environment that several members of the Committee, including myself, dissented from the report. The general feeling of the group is summed up in recommendation 40:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a two-tiered approach be adopted for the release of GMOs to the environment. GMAC should be retained to grant approval for contained work and as a specialist advisory body. . . The GMO Release Authority should have responsibility for the authorisation of all releases of GMOs, whether for field trials at the pre-product stage or for releases of products containing GMOs and also for setting minimum standards and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>Several members of the Committee&mdash;as I said, including myself&mdash;believe that the release authority should be the Parliament. Releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment is just so important. Parliament should not delegate such a vital task to any other authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record on environmental releases&mdash;not the more recent but earlier ones&mdash;continues to cause the nation huge problems. I instance cane toads, rabbits, foxes, sparrows, feral cats and dogs, to name a few. There are a few on the other side of the House, are there not? The number of releases will be very small, and I believe strongly that any release should be debated in the people's Parliament. Any releases must have the approval of the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I must congratulate the Committee on the tremendous amount of work it has put into what remains a difficult and controversial subject. I thank the staff supporting the Committee for their great work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present state of biotechnology research is precarious as a result of tightening research funds, the recession and the rural downturn, and a lack of venture capital. Unfortunately, there has been a reduction in biotechnological research, which is likely to continue into the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on genetically modified organisms. I congratulate the Committee on the work it did, and note the tireless effort put in by the staff: their support was exemplary. I agree very much with a lot of the remarks made by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) and congratulate him on the considered effort he has put into his speech and on the ongoing effort he made, through the work of that Committee. This is potentially a very big industry, and one in which we have a real advantage, because a lot of the work has been done in Australia, and a lot of it is a world cutting-edge style of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the submissions. The submissions to our Committee, culminating in the release of our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genetic Manipulation: The Threat or the Glory?</EMPHASIS>, were generally of a very high standard, and I was continually impressed by the effort put in by a lot of the academic people in making their submissions to us. However, I feel that the standard of submissions put in by groups such as the ACF and some of the environment groups was actually appalling. They came in and regaled us with emotion, devoid of all facts; with half-truths; and, in some cases, with absolutely irrelevant nonsense. It was actually quite tiring to sit through some of the tirades we received from those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of new organisms into the environment is not something that is new to society: it has been happening for a long time. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned the rabbit plague inflicted on Australia through what was basically nostalgia and a complete lack of commonsense. Of course, it had devastating effects on this country. The myxomatosis virus was essential to Australia's well-being and greatly assisted our economy. Had we had the present climate then, in the early 1950s, I doubt whether myxomatosis would have been released. We would have been locked down by all sorts of arguments, regaled with arguments that we must protect genetic diversity and that it would be wrong to introduce something that was going to kill out a particular species, knowing full well that it would never completely kill it out and that the species would&mdash;as it has done&mdash;produce its own immunities. Nevertheless, it was a very important thing at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the organisms which has been released on the world, and which has probably changed genetic diversity more than anything else, is of course penicillin. I do not think that anyone could argue that the release of penicillin was a bad thing. It has probably saved more lives than anything else has, other than pure water. Its release has greatly modified a lot of diseases that used to be killers. Over time, some of those organisms have developed their own resistance. We have had to continually modify penicillin, which has generated other types of antibiotics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the north-west of my State, Western Australia, we have the potential for enormous industry, and enormous change to the cattle industry, with the development of leucaena. Leucaena is a species of leguminous tree, in fact, that comes from South American areas. It is a very high-protein plant, but it contains a toxin called mimosene. It was found that cattle in Australia could survive with about 40 per cent of this in their diets. Non-ruminants can hardly eat it at all: anything more than 2 per cent is very toxic to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cattle in Hawaii and South America seem to be able to eat this plant with impunity. Research done in Australia discovered that the rumens of the cattle overseas contain a bacteria which does not exist in Australia. This bacteria lives only to attack mimosene. It converts the mimosene in the rumen to harmless products which do not hurt cattle. As a result of this, cattle can graze on leucaena continuously: the fattening rates are enormous. It does offer the very real benefits of a new industry, supplying cattle to Indonesia and to other countries to the north of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to David Bradley, a vet at Kununurra. He and his wife, as the owners of Carlton Hill Station, have done an enormous amount of work in opening up this market. I hope that the bureaucracy in this country is able to assist them, rather than, as the honourable member for Dunkley has pointed out, so often putting obstacles in the way. What the Bradleys are offering is the potential to change the northern cattle industry from 85c a kilo to $1.25, and the integration of Australia into downstream processing, by taking a position in abattoirs in countries that receive these cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has an enormous potential. It would not have happened had that bacteria not been released in Australia. When that bacteria was released, it was thought by many that we would have to inoculate every single beast, but we found that as soon as we had it introduced in the rumens of just a few cattle it passed by word of mouth, one might say, by simple contact. It is now widely spread, endemic, among the cattle in the area and is working very well indeed. Looking at that and applying commonsense, one could see the enormous benefits but, had it been left to some of the bodies that we have in Australia today, every conceivable obstacle would have been put in its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that one has to be cautious in these things, but commonsense is the great tool. Commonsense is something which is in fact free to all. I agree with the honourable member for Dunkley when he says that the final authority for the release of the organisms should be this Parliament, because this Parliament, one would hope, represents in a sense the commonsense of the nation. While I think GMAC has done excellent work, and as a member of this Parliament I would certainly be guided by that, I believe that for too long now politicians in Australia on both sides of the Parliament have been happy to pass off their responsibilities to other groups, to divest themselves of responsibility so that they can say to an electorate at large, `Well, it is not really us; this decision is made by a committee, a committee over which we have no power'. It is an abdication of power which I find intolerable and I believe that this Parliament must fight, if it is going to have any relevance in the future, to regain that power. I believe that this Parliament must fight not only to take that power back from delegated authority but to take it back from the Executive of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were enshrined, by a free vote&mdash;not a vote on party lines, because this is not an issue that should involve parties at all&mdash;that this Parliament should be the ultimate authority for saying whether these new organisms can be released or not, I believe that in the long run would be the safest mechanism for Australia. It must also be understood that many of these organisms that are released are by definition very benign. They cannot get out of control&mdash;they are in fact dead material&mdash;and there is no need for exhaustive consultation. Applying commonsense to the available scientific knowledge should enable members of this Parliament to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a report which by and large is a very good report. It is one of the most memorable reports that I have been involved in in this Parliament. But I am concerned that we are hiving off that responsibility to yet another committee. I believe that power should reside with this Parliament. I cannot say that strongly enough. I support the honourable member for Dunkley in his assertion that that should be the case, and hope that in the longer term sanity will prevail and the responsibility will be laid where it rightly should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to continue my comments on the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on the possible uses of the sixth high power television channel. The report was tabled last week. I have already spoken about the Committee's recommendation that community television groups be allowed to broadcast on low power on the sixth channel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of factors which contributed to the decision, such as cost, the fact that educational broadcasters will not be in a position to begin broadcasting educational services on the channel for a number of years, and the lack of hard evidence on the viability of community television. I agree that it is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation: if they cannot broadcast, how can they demonstrate viability? That is the strength of the approach taken by this Committee, and this is a report where everyone can be a winner if a bit of commonsense prevails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long term interests of educational broadcasting are assured and community broadcasters have an opportunity to demonstrate the viability of their service, both in terms of audience demand and in terms of financial and programming resources. To cap it off, there is no demand placed on the taxpayer for funding to build high power transmission facilities and subsidise operational costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other benefit of low power transmission for community television that I personally believe is significant is that low power will emphasise the community and the local community's television access. How can we have a community station that broadcasts to all of Sydney, Brisbane or Melbourne? The community groups criticise the commercial stations as being so big that they have lost their community focus. Again, I stress that having micro transmission stations means that local news, sport, other programs and advertising would be on air at times to suit local audiences. Community television will operate best when it focuses on truly local communities. The local community needs to be small enough to enable everyone who wants to participate to have a say in what is going on. Otherwise, it is possible that the community access television service ends up being run by a group of people who are interested in only community television and not necessarily the local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On educational television, the Committee recognises the potential benefits that would be available to the community if educational services were able to be delivered in a structured way by television. This would serve to supplement existing face to face teaching. It would enable the extension of educational services to many who cannot attend educational institutions for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the vexing questions the Committee faced was what impact technology would have over the next five years or so. We are all well aware of the rapid changes taking place in cable, fibre and satellite. They all have a potential to provide additional means of delivering educational television and, of course, community television at the same time. In fact, the witnesses from the Department of Employment, Education and Training informed the Committee that they would prefer to use optic fibre instead of the sixth channel. Furthermore, they told us that it would be best to leave it for two years before they could reach agreement on cooperation on a national educational delivery organisation. Educational interests are uncertain about the amount of air time that would be required, the time slots, the value of educational television or when they would be in a position to fully utilise the sixth channel. They were agreed on the capacity that the channel would offer for flexibility and experimentation and the potential to extend the range of educational services offered to the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee did not wish to cut off the option for educational use of the channel. It should have, and will have, a top priority if required. Hopefully, by 1997 the educationists will be in a position to know what they want and the community broadcasters will be in a position to demonstrate their viability. What happens then will be dependent on what technology has to offer in real terms. I agree that we cannot wait forever for technology to deliver, but at least we should be in a position to make informed decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, with the benefit of having a week since the report was tabled, I am pleased to note that the various community groups appear to have realised the opportunities that they have, if this report is accepted and acted upon. Community broadcasters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, while expressing disappointment at not having high power recommended and not having government subsidies recommended, have reacted positively and are moving ahead with plans to establish low power services. They realise that, while they will not have guaranteed permanent access to the spectrum, five years is better than 28 days at a time and they now have an opportunity to establish their credentials as broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the members of the Subcommittee: the Chairman&mdash;the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)&mdash;and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). Also, I thank the Committee and I thank the staff&mdash;Malcolm Aldons, Christopher Paterson, Paul Mackey, June Murphy&mdash;for the assistance given during the inquiry and the patience they showed to some of us. I also thank my own staff and constituents of my electorate for the efforts they have put in at my request to give information on this most important subject. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has done a good service to broadcasting in Australia in the way that it has presented its report on the last free to air television channel in Australia. I must, at the outset, acknowledge a personal interest as one of my sons, Andrew Nehl&mdash;who is the manager of Radio JJJ&mdash;is a very keen proponent of public television and was the only individual person to submit evidence to the Committee. So I felt it appropriate that I should acknowledge the fact that I do have a personal interest in it and, certainly, my thinking has been greatly influenced by my son Andrew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the difficulty of the Committee. The report says in its preface that the inquiry could not have come at a worse time, because the impact of rapid technological change is going to greatly increase the means that will bring broadcast services. The Committee has had a very difficult task in trying to adjudicate between competing and conflicting interests. They cannot, in the Committee's words, `be satisfied adequately by the sixth high power television channel'. I do not necessarily believe that to be the case. The two major conflicting interests are those of public television and the need for an education network. I think they can coexist quite satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My particular bent is not to denigrate the needs of educational television&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I do wish in the time available to me to put forward the case for public television. I do this on my own behalf, not on my son's, because of my fervent and passionate belief in democracy. Embodied in that is the question of free speech. I think we have seen already, through the growth of public radio in this country, that the institution of free speech&mdash;the institution of democracy&mdash;has been bolstered by that. I certainly see the provision of public television, through community groups&mdash;to give community groups and organisations and interests the opportunity of expressing their views through the television medium&mdash;as something which does bolster democracy. I suppose this is my real basis in pursuing this particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community access television has been waiting for a very long time and educational interests are certainly very keen to use that channel. The Committee's priority for the channel, as announced, is for educational television; but, of course, its proponents are not yet in a position to even start using it properly. I do not see that as being inconsistent with community use at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has suggested that it is not able to support community access television on the sixth high power television channel because that would need substantial funding from government, and it is not a cost effective proposition in the context of rapid technological change. If one accepts that, one has to also suggest that there is a slight lack of logic in saying that we will have it for educational television but not for community television, because educational television will need funding as well. One-off grants would be required to get community access television up and running on a high power channel, but not ongoing funding, although that would certainly be needed with an educational channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Committee has probably come up with the best possible result under the circumstances and, as I said earlier, I praise it. It has recommended that continual test transmissions for community access television using low power transmitters on the channel should be started almost immediately and continue until the review of the television broadcasting industry which is due by 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly accept that that is a reasonable thing to do and I certainly do not deny the fundamental importance of the education system to Australia. If we are going to succeed as a nation and assume our place in the world, able to assist the whole of the world as well as our own citizens, education is of enormous importance. But equally, because of my passion for free speech and democracy, I believe that the issue of free speech through community television is also of fundamental importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I see no inconsistency between community access television and the need for educational television. I am sure that provision could be made&mdash;even by legislation if necessary, but I do not think it would be&mdash;for the necessary time on community access television for educational programs. Of course, the Committee made the point that educational television is not in a position to make sufficient use of the channel at present. A relevant and reasonable question is: when will it be? I do not think anybody has an answer to that at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also said that rapid technological change will facilitate the entry of many new players into the market. It has the potential to increase diversity of ownership and diversity of news and views and opinions. I certainly applaud that. The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . given this, community access television on the 6th high power television channel supported by the taxpayer is not cost-effective and is not supported by the Committee;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not see how the Committee can say that about community access television but not consider the same proposition in relation to educational television. The Committee also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One option canvassed in the Options/Issues Paper issued on 18 June was to auction or call tenders for the rights . . . in order to determine whether the channel should be used for commercial or non-commercial services. This is a decision the Minister should make.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally disagree with the Committee in that particular area. I do not believe that the Committee should be suggesting that the Minister should be in a position to make a decision on whether to opt for auction or for tender. I believe this channel must remain free from commercial interest and should be available for community and educational sources. Therefore, I have to say a very definite no to that particular point made by the Committee. I believe there should be a forthright statement that the sixth and last high power television channel should be available for community services, community broadcasters and education. Let us have both. I think they are compatible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, as it says, was faced with two choices. One was to recommend deferral of the decision. It did not do that, and it has gone ahead and made a recommendation. I applaud the Committee for having the great good sense to make that correct decision and for making a recommendation that the channel should be available immediately for community access television using low power transmitters on a continuing trial basis until 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was right: that is the correct choice, as far as it goes. I note that the Committee's finding No. 3 on technology at page 37 of the report made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are no technical obstacles to the 6th TV Channel being utilised to broadcast non-commercial television services via high power transmission once decisions are made on the funding and installation of transmission infrastructure. Low power transmission presents some technical and planning obstacles but it is possible for it to be used to transmit non-commercial television services.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is true, and it applies to the question of both educational and public TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that public TV has already committed those involved to a high educational component. Five years down the track the optic fibre digital compression will increase the possibilities for interactive educational TV. The Committee has come forward with a tremendous report and I congratulate the Committee members, but I must make the point that the five years given to community TV is not enough. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister responsible for the Opposition's communications policy, I want to make a few remarks about the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on the possible uses of the sixth high power television channel. There have been a major series of reports, and some comment, this week about communications issues, of which the Standing Committee's report about the sixth channel is one. The others include the report yesterday of the inquiry into pay TV by a special committee of the Senate, the decisions by the Government with regard to spectrum management and Asian television and the involvement of the ABC, and finally the decision to recognise journalists' privilege in the recently passed Broadcasting Services Act. They are all matters that point to dramatic change taking place in communications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has just outlined in considerable detail some of the difficulties that were faced by the Committee in reporting about the use of the sixth channel. On behalf of the coalition parties, I indicate that I followed the report very carefully as it was being prepared. I particularly commend the good work of my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the detailed analysis that has been undertaken by the Committee relating to the very difficult technological questions, as well as the philosophical questions, that had to be addressed, as was alluded to by my colleague the honourable member for Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also emphasise the value of utilising technology, whatever it might be, in promoting education. We like to talk about the clever country, so we must make sure that these technologies, new access arrangements and availability modes do enhance not only entertainment opportunities but also educational opportunities for Australians. I think it would be remiss of the Parliament not to explore those possibilities in conjunction with commercial interests as well as publicly funded broadcasting. There are funding implications and the Committee tried to grapple with those as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill, which I have just presented, will amend a provision of the Parliamentary Privileges Act which has the potential to cause great injustice. The Parliamentary Privileges Act was passed in 1987. It represented a turning point in the history of the Australian Parliament because, for the first time, the Parliament enacted comprehensive legislation as provided for by section 49 of the Constitution. This exercise in law reform followed a comprehensive review of the law relating to privilege and contempt conducted by a joint select committee which reported in 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many features of the 1987 Act were to be admired. The Houses established statutory provisions for the protection of witnesses who give evidence to parliamentary committees. Doubts about the powers of the Houses to impose fines were removed. A threshold definition of contempt was established to help winnow out some of the more trifling matters which had concerned the Houses over the years. A limited right of review was established where a House had committed a person to prison for contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Act was deficient in one important respect: subsection 16(3) provides that witnesses in courts or other tribunals cannot be questioned or examined about evidence they may have given to a House or a committee. This provision has the effect of preventing the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses as to prior inconsistent statements given to a House or a committee, such as had taken place in the trials of Mr Justice Murphy and Judge Foord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this provision carried the reach of parliamentary privilege too far. I presume none of us doubt that honourable members and others who take part in parliamentary proceedings, such as committee hearings, should be protected from being sued or prosecuted on account of what is said in the course of these proceedings. I also accept that a person who is actually on trial for an offence should not be able to be cross-examined about statements he or she may have made to a committee. But the 1987 Act goes too far in preventing a person who is not himself or herself the subject of court proceedings from being cross-examined about statements made to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I adopt unreservedly what was said by Mr Spender, QC, the then shadow Attorney-General, in the House of Representatives debate on 5 May in 1987. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us take a hypothetical case in which a witness comes before a parliamentary committee and gives evidence which is quite untruthful and which amounts to a charge of serious criminal conduct against a third person. That third person is charged. The same witness is called and gives different evidence but the evidence is vital to the case, for example, vital to the prosecution. Should it not be open to the accused person to say, `The evidence he is giving is untruthful. What he says now is different from what he said before the parliamentary committee.'?</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, that is the effect of the existing legislation&mdash;one is prevented from asking those questions. Other honourable members and honourable senators had reservations on this point. It seems, however, that they did not wish to delay the passage of the Bill with its other many worthwhile reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present state of the Parliamentary Privileges Act on this point carried parliamentary privilege further than is necessary or desirable. It has the potential to prevent the giving of evidence that may in some future case be vital to the rights of a person on trial. We can and must remove this obstacle. I believe we can do so without causing any harm to the parliamentary institution. Indeed, the very possibility that a person could be questioned later about answers given to a committee could help to encourage a person to give truthful evidence in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recognise the scholarship of Sir Clarrie Harders, who has devoted a good deal of time to researching this matter and whose comprehensive paper titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privilege&mdash;Parliament versus the Courts: cross examination of committee witnesses</EMPHASIS>, published by the Parliamentary Research Service last October, prompted me to take up the issue. Sir Clarrie is present in the gallery today and I thank him for that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition initially advanced by Sir Clarrie and incorporated in this Bill is not inconsistent with the law we have inherited. Perhaps more importantly, it is a recognition that the perceived needs of a parliament should not be allowed to ride roughshod over other considerations, such as the administration of justice. My remedy recognises these considerations, and it will not harm Parliament's interests. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that honourable members will take the opportunity to study this measure and I will welcome their comments on it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill seeks to amend section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act, which deals with offences in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As the explanatory memorandum says, section 299:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . contains subparagraph 1(d)(ii), which provides that a person shall not, by writing or speech, use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. To contravene this subparagraph is an offence punishable upon conviction by a penalty of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)in the case of a natural person&mdash;$500 or imprisonment for 6 months, or both; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)in the case of a body corporate&mdash;$1,000.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill seeks to have 1(d)(ii) omitted from section 299. I first introduced the Bill to the House of Representatives on 8 November 1990 but it lapsed without a second reading due to lack of Government support. I then reintroduced the Bill on 16 May 1991, when once again it lapsed without a second reading through similar lack of Government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old saying `Third time lucky'. So on 4 June 1992, I reintroduced the Bill for a third time. Due to a recent High Court decision relating directly to this Bill we are now debating my Bill and I trust we will move to a third reading and royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at stake is freedom, in this instance freedom of speech and freedom of the press. I have dealt with freedom of association in another Bill which is also before this House but which has now lapsed for lack of Government support. I must say this Government does not appear to be overtly concerned with the issues of freedom and the rights of the individual in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of section 299 (1)(d)(ii) are a clear denial to this nation's citizens of their inalienable right of free speech in our democratic society. They are likewise a denial of our assumed right of freedom of the press&mdash;a freedom critical to not only the dissemination of information but also the active debate of all public issues in a free democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my original first reading speech, I argued that I had informed my learned colleagues who are members of the legal profession that the word `calculated' in essence means `likely'. In the context of the related clause, then one could read that clause as saying `by writing or speech, use words likely to bring a member of the Commission into disrepute'. It is my view that such a statement, such a provision, gives the Industrial Relations Commission a measure of protection not given to a court of law, to the Parliament or to a member of the wider public&mdash;in fact, a freedom or protection from even the truth. If that is so, then one might say or write in the press that a member of the Commission is a terrible tennis player. This might be true but such a statement might well be likely to bring the commissioner into disrepute. In such a circumstance, a journalist writing that a member of the Commission is a terrible tennis player in fact makes himself or herself liable, under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, to prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 August of this year, the High Court brought down a judgment in favour of Nationwide News Pty Ltd. This judgment reversed a lower court decision that Nationwide News had contravened section 299 (1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act by publishing an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> written by the late Maxwell Newton which was critical of the Industrial Relations Commission. The High Court found that section 299 (1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 is not a valid law of the Commonwealth within the provisions of the Constitution. A report of the High Court decision in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 29 August said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the appeal to the High Court, Nationwide News argued that by suppressing comment on, and criticism of, the Industrial Relations Commission in such wide terms the Federal Government went beyond the powers granted to it under the constitution to legislate in relation to conciliation and arbitration. The High Court ruled the disputed section of the Industrial Relations Act was not a valid law within the provisions of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not charge this Government with originating this iniquitous section of industrial relations law. Similar words were contained within the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904 so we have lived with this provision for a very long time indeed. However, I am highly critical of the Government and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for not acting to nullify a bad law when brought to their attention on 8 November 1990, when I first introduced this private member's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government also failed to act on recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report No. 35 on contempt, presented on 3 June 1987. That report suggested section 299 (1)(d)(ii) be replaced with other words which would give the Commission and commissioners a form of protection against defamation and slander less onerous than the offending clause. So the Government has before it two recommendations that it deal with this subparagraph. The first recommends revision and the second, this Bill, recommends its removal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In framing my original Bill, I gave due consideration to the Law Reform Commission recommendations but, on balance, I concluded that the members of the Industrial Relations Commission are given adequate protection to right of defamation action in common law. In coming to that conclusion, I noted that the Industrial Relations Commission and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in earlier times have been highly selective in using this section of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr H.R. Nicholls, editor of the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, was the first recipient of the Arbitration Court's arbitrary and selective use of section 299(1)(d)(ii) as it appeared in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of that time, as it sought to have Mr Nicholls charged with contempt in 1911. Records also indicate that the section was used in Bell v. Stewart in 1920 and in Howard v. Gallagher in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has come under vociferous and sustained criticism since its decision in April 1991 to reject accord mark VI between this Labor Government and the ACTU. These sometimes blistering attacks have been made by members of this Labor Government's front bench, ACTU paid bureaucrats and various union officials. The Commission has been accused of lacking ability, of having obvious bias and of hypocrisy, impropriety and incompetence. The Commission's decision has been described as sickening but it was said that the trade union movement would not eat the vomit. The Commission has been told that it is just a cog in a very big machine and that, if it is feeling a tooth or two out of alignment with other cogs, then it is feeling it correctly. The Commission has been told that its membership includes mainly incompetent and underqualified people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attacks on the AIRC have been highly public and widely reported. It is clear that, in the public's mind, the Commission has been marginalised and its membership brought into disrepute. Nevertheless, the Director of Public Prosecutions has been unwilling to use the provisions of section 299 to discipline Government Ministers, ACTU officials or union officials. It is indeed strange that those most enamoured of the retention of our highly regulated and bureaucratic industrial relations system have been the ones to slight the umpire. For as long as we retain the award system it is, in my view, imperative that we retain a truly independent umpire that has the total support of both the Australian community and the industrial relations players. Nonetheless, an inequitable law will not solve the Commission's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are amongst the most basic guarantees in a free democratic society. Parliament has a responsibility as a legislator to ensure that we do not&mdash;even unintentionally&mdash;challenge, demean or degrade these basic rights. If we have a bad law&mdash;and I have believed for a long time that this is such a law&mdash;then it is incumbent on us to remove it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision upholds the stance that I have taken in this place since 8 November 1990.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subparagraph proposed to be removed by the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill is a standard provision mirrored in State legislation around the country and it is there for good cause. As a practitioner in industrial relations myself for more than a decade in State jurisdiction in Queensland under a Bjelke-Petersen National Party Government, I can assure honourable members that there were more than a few occasions when I had serious disagreements with the outcomes of those decisions and the benches involved. Nonetheless, the provisions in the Act to protect the Commission from public criticisms were respected by and large by all involved&mdash;and so they should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see here today in this recycled Bill before the Parliament is part of a broader plan adopted by the Opposition&mdash;adopted by the Liberal Party&mdash;to reduce the influence of the Industrial Relations Commission, to destroy its position in wage fixing in this country. Indeed, the Fightback policy as a whole bases its economic forecasts on zero wage growth till the year 2001. That cannot be accomplished if the Industrial Relations Commission is allowed to stay in place. That goes to the heart of the real issue pursued by the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July this year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), under the  headline `After Slashing Youth Wages Howard Sets Sights on Adults'. It is clear that that is fundamental to their economic forecasts throughout this decade if they win government. A short time after that, on 29 July, the Opposition detailed some of those plans of the shadow industrial relations spokesperson when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it wins government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, if the Liberal Party wins government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the coalition intends to use pay rates up to 50 per cent below the award minimums specified in Australia's regulated wages system as a means for tackling unemployment amongst teenagers and adults out of work for more than a year.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition knows that it cannot do that while the Industrial Relations Commission is in place and it therefore seeks at every opportunity to attack the institution and to attack the people who are in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen here today is a more subtle but nonetheless direct attack upon the Industrial Relations Commission. I will refer later to some very direct comments which the honourable member for Bennelong made about the Commission and its composition. However, the Liberal policies in these areas are not even supported by major employer groups. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in June of this year referred to comments made by the Metal Trades Industry Association&mdash;a key employer group. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Metal Trades Industry Association slammed the Opposition's plan to encourage companies and employees to deal outside the Industrial Relations Commission, saying it would lead to an explosion of legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an outcome which I am sure the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who speaks after me, would enjoy, he being a solicitor practising in industrial law. He would be one of the few winners out of such a policy. Mr Bob Herbert, the Victorian Director of the MTIA, was then quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst thing they could do now is remove the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the worst thing the Opposition could do. That is what the MTIA has said. It makes no difference to the Opposition's hard core, ideologically driven policies, though the Liberal Opposition intends to persist. In fact, the debate we are having today is a re-run, in many senses, of the debates in this country at the turn of the century. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) quite rightly referred to legislation in 1904 and comments made by Mr Nicholls at the time&mdash;a person well revered by some in the Opposition, including the honourable member for Higgins, who was proud to write the constitution for the H.R. Nicholls Society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate we are having now is one that we have not seen in this country since the turn of the century. It is no longer a case of saying that unions are doing things wrongly, or that the Industrial Relations Commission is doing things wrongly. It is now a debate in which the Opposition says: `We do not believe industrial unions should be able to exist. We do not believe the Industrial Relations Commission should be able to operate. We do not believe there should be an umpire to which workers can go if they need to settle disputes'. That is quite plain in their policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will say that they support the retention of unions and the Industrial Relations Commission with a smaller role. Indeed, it is a much smaller role. Their policy quite expressly states that a person can go to the Industrial Relations Commission as a worker&mdash;a person can have recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;only if the employer agrees. A person can have recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission only if the employer agrees. Anybody who has been involved in industrial relations knows what a nonsense it is to say that, in a dispute situation, one can go to the Industrial Relations Commission but only if the employer allows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong is on the record on a number of occasions endorsing that proposition. To achieve that goal, which is critical to their Fightback package of zero wage growth for the next decade, those opposite know they must set about destroying the Industrial Relations Commission and attacking its very right to exist. In that respect it is important to have a look at some of the earlier comments that they have made. In April this year, the honourable member for Bennelong said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National parties will not guarantee the security of tenure of future appointments by the Keating Government to the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quite blatant threat to the appointees to the Industrial Relations Commission that their tenure would be under challenge were the Liberal Party to win office. There was no hiding behind the bushes when it came to that argument. It was a straight-out attack on the members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of hoo-ha about the composition of the Commission, and that needs to be put to rest. There are 15 presidential members of the Industrial Relations Commission. Five of them have a union background: one-third. That is in keeping with the traditional balance on industrial commissions throughout the country. Typically we find approximately one-third with a union background, one-third with an employer background and one-third from the public sector or the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a look beyond the presidential members of the Commission we find that the balance is decidedly in favour of the employers. The important decisions taken by the Commission are taken by the Full Bench of the Commission. National wage cases are not determined by single commissioners; they are determined by the Full Bench. The composition of the Full Bench from 1983 to the most recent bench demonstrates quite clearly the predominance of employer representatives. In September 1983 the Bench was made up of three employers, one union representative and three others. Two years later, in November 1985, it was made up of three employers, no union representatives at all, and two others. In March 1987 it was made up of four employers, two with a union background and one other. In February 1989 it was four employers, one with a union background and two others. The most recent Full Bench, in October 1991, had two employers, one from a union and two from another background. If we add up every single Full Bench since 1983, we find that 42 of those sitting on the Full Bench had an employer background, 14 had a union background and 25 came from some other area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nonsense peddled by the Opposition, the shadow spokesperson and by those who have entered this debate on the other side about the bias in the Industrial Relations Commission is a fiction which they peddle knowing it to be untrue. They should be ashamed of their performance, but they know they have to do that if they are to try to discredit the Industrial Relations Commission to achieve their Fightback target of zero wage growth through until the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Metal Trades Industry Association has published a booklet that points out quite accurately that we cannot relate one system to a particular outcome. Japan has company bargaining with a very productive record, America has company bargaining with productivity growth worse than Australia, and Germany has a very centralised system and an excellent productivity basis to its economy. One cannot be linked to the other in the mad, ideological fetish with which those opposite have pursued the Fightback package and the key industrial relations component of that package. This Bill is part of that attack, and I oppose it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Regardless of whether the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) had read the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill or understood it, he just took the opportunity to tell us everything he thought he knew&mdash;or that he thought the Opposition had said or believed&mdash;about industrial relations and to share in a blinkered, narrow and inflexible way all of the prejudices that he has about the industrial relations system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does one thing and one thing alone. It seeks to delete from the Industrial Relations Act subsection (1)(d)(ii). It seeks to delete from the Industrial Relations Act the making of it an offence to bring a member of the Industrial Relations Commission or the Commission itself into disrepute. I would have thought that the Bill was unarguable. The argument is unanswerable because the High Court has found that part of the Act unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court handed down a decision&mdash;as the mover of the motion said&mdash;in the case of Nationwide News Pty Ltd and Andrew Gary Wills, saying that that section of the Act is unconstitutional. Whether it stands in the Act or not, it has no effect. It is a dead branch. It is no more alive than the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was alive after the High Court declared it unconstitutional. That stayed on the statute books for nearly 20 years. But the High Court had declared it unconstitutional. Nobody could do anything under it. It had no effect in law. It was as if it had not been enacted. To stand here and oppose this Bill is to say, `We want to leave in the statute book a statute that has no effect whatsoever, can never be relied upon and has been declared unconstitutional'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument in favour of this Bill is unanswerable. There is no answer to the proposition that has now been put forward by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). As he rightly said, this question is as old as 1911, when a newspaper editor&mdash;Henry Richard Nicholls&mdash;was put up on a contempt of court charge for writing an article about what was then the Commonwealth Court, a court of conciliation and arbitration. In that case, the High Court said this&mdash;and it was a very great victory for free speech, even in 1911:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if any Judge of this Court or of any other Court were to make a public utterance of such character as to be likely to impair the confidence of the public, or of suitors or any class of suitors in the impartiality of the Court in any matter likely to be brought before it, any public comment on such an utterance, if it were a fair comment, would, so far from being a contempt of Court, be for the public benefit. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It would be for the public benefit. The courts then recognised that if one were to make a public comment&mdash;which was a fair comment&mdash;on a statement by a judge that was plainly wrong or impaired confidence in the institution, then far from being a contempt of court, or far from being a criminal offence as this unconstitutional subsection would otherwise make it, it is in the public interest. It is in the public interest to be able to scrutinise institutions and to know what they are doing and, where they are wrong, to point it out. It is absolutely in the public interest that this Parliament recognises that principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than leave on the statute books unconstitutional legislation that impairs freedom of speech, that inhibits the opportunity to evaluate the job that public institutions are doing, we ought to say&mdash;as the High Court has said in its recent judgment, as it said as long ago as 1911&mdash;yes, we believe in free speech. People ought to have the right to scrutinise the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;just as they ought to have the right to scrutinise the Parliament, just as we ought to have an informed debate, which we failed to have from the honourable member's speech.

We have only touched the sides of it so far. In their package they dedicate only half a page to industrial relations. A country can have good industrial relations or bad industrial relations. There is little doubt that, under the Opposition, we would have very bad industrial relations practices&mdash;practices which would do nothing to instil protection of the work force into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has provided, under the accord, one of the most stable industrial relations systems in this country for many years, particularly since 1983. It is something that we are justly proud of and something the Australian work force has been able to work with collectively and cooperatively. That would not exist under a coalition government. Australians have realised that fact, and the Australian work force realises that as well. The destruction of the industrial relations processes we have today and the imposition of some dreadful goods and services tax on Australians are something that the Australian work force will obviously reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that honourable members opposite are out to destroy the Australian work force. They have no respect for Australian workers. They just see them as some sort of a chattel that they can use. They are human beings, these people. I had to laugh when I actually read some comment from the honourable member for La Trobe in one of his first speeches here when he quoted one of his own constituents. I quote from his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of 4 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A constituent of mine in the electorate of La Trobe recently said to me that in her view the Liberal Party represented the individual and the Australian Labor Party represented institutions. How true.</PARA>
<PARA>He said, `How true', but how very wrong he is, because it is the Liberals that represent institutions and, on this side of the House, the Australian Labor Party Government represents the rights of individuals, and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He only needs to see what is going on in many industries in Australia. Honourable members only need to look at the Opposition's record in Burnie, Tasmania, with the APPM dispute to see just what sort of industrial relations attitudes and practices they would have. These attitudes can be seen in their support for the employers in their attack on the work force there. Honourable members could consider the shearing industry in Australia at the moment with the New Zealand shearers coming over here and exploiting the Australian work force. Once again, that is the sort of thing that the Opposition would put up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Opposition is not being genuine in what it is putting forward. It is just another one of its excuses to attack the Industrial Relations Commission, which has been one of those things that have provided good stable industrial relations in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House recognises the contribution the sugar industry makes to the economy of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to move this motion today, appearing in my name, to ensure that the House does recognise the contribution that the sugar industry has made, not only to Queensland and northern New South Wales but, indeed, to Australia. The sugar industry is one of our leading export primary industries and one of our leading industries. It not only employs thousands of men and women all the way along the Queensland and northern New South Wales coasts, but it has throughout our history created many of the provincial cities that we now have on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, one could say that from Grafton to Mossman the majority of cities that now exist are there because of the establishment of the sugar industry. While it is fair to recognise that in these cities there are other industries that we all applaud and welcome, the fact is that it was sugar that established these cities so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar has also had an historical effect, both romantically and politically, on this nation, and particularly on Queensland. It was the sugar industry to which wealthy plantation owners and companies brought slaves from the South Sea islands, and that is a bad blot on this country's copybook. There is a need for more recognition of the South Sea islanders who still live in our great State who are descendants of those people who were brought here against their will to work as slaves in the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, we saw expansion and development of the union movement through the lack of conditions because of the slave labour. Out of the sugar industry came the Sugar Workers Union which in 1913 amalgamated under one of the great Labor Premiers of this country, Ted Theodore, to form the Australian Workers Union. Those people fought for one thing: decent working conditions for Australian workers. The fight still goes on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is historically necessary to recognise the contribution of some outstanding people within the sugar industry, and in particular a great man and a great Premier, William Forgan Smith. Forgan Smith is the</PARA>
<PARA>man who, more than any other Premier in Queensland, established and broadened the sugar industry. While Bill McCormack, T.J. Ryan, Edward Theodore, Frank Cooper, and Ned Hanlon all need to be recognised, it was Forgan Smith who was the giant of the sugar industry. Indeed, during part of the period that Forgan Smith was Premier we had the contribution from not only John Curtin but, importantly in the postwar era, from Ben Chifley and the strategy that expanded our opportunities for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the same historical fact applies. We have in Ed Casey and Wayne Goss, the Minister for Primary Industries and the Premier, two men who are committed to the sugar industry. We have in the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Commonwealth Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) two men who are committed to the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see the two speakers who are going to follow on the other side squirming in their seats. The actual fact with regard to the sugar industry today is that the Federal Government has set up a committee of inquiry to investigate the recommendations of the Industry Commission report. I am pleased to chair that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a vested interest. I have a cane farm and I care about sugar. The real difference is that our Government is not going to adopt the IC report or bureaucratic recommendations. We are going to work with the industry to bring about the best results for the sugar industry. On the other side of the House we have the National Party being dragged along by the Liberals in implementing and supporting the Industry Commission report in its entirety with the elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said it three or four times: people such as Senator O'Chee and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when they go up north are not prepared to say it. It is here in table 4.1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. I will read it once again. Under the heading `Reform' there is `Rural and manufacturing assistance (IC)'. When we look at the measures involved it states, `Elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance'. It cannot be said any more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recognise that while the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) does not understand the difference between anti-dumping and tariff because tariff is a support mechanism, at least the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) does understand because he resigned from his shadow ministry on that basis. I do recognise that he did that on a point of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson has been quoted in the paper as saying what a loss there will be to the Mackay region as a consequence of the tariff cuts that have already come into place. What a loss there will be to the Mackay region with zero tariffs. I would like to challenge the Leader of the National Party to go to Mackay, to go to Proserpine, and to look those farmers in the eye and say, `Zero tariffs are not going to affect the farmers of this area'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time they have the hide to say that the abolition of these taxes is going to be really beneficial to cane farmers. I will go through them again, as I have in the past. There is the abolition of wholesales sales tax. We have already exempted wholesale sales tax from farmers. There is the abolition of payroll tax. Cane farmers do not pay payroll tax. It is about time the leader of the National Party went up and talked to cane farmers who are struggling to make $10. When the ACIL report was done about the effect of Fightback on four farms, the net incomes were $55,000 to $71,000, with no interest or redemption payments. There is not one cane farmer in this country earning that sort of money. It makes a mockery of Fightback, it makes a mockery of what the NFF did, and it makes a mockery of the way in which the report was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us go on to the others. Take the abolition of the excise on petroleum. They have not had the courage on the other side of the House to say how they are going to fund roads. But cane farmers do not use petrol, and I am sure that even the two National Party members who are going to follow me in this speech recognise that. Then there is the abolition of the training guarantee charge. Surely to goodness everyone recognises the need for a cleverer, smarter country. What we need to do is to ensure that our work force in the mills and our work force in the refineries are trying to work efficiently to maintain our position as the leading industry in the world in sugar. To abolish that training charge is stupidity. Then they are going to abolish the coal export levy. I am sure that the cane farmers are going to be really rapt about that! I do not know many cane farmers who dig up coal, I can tell you. They are going to increase the excise on tobacco, so when the cane farmer who is totally devastated by the Opposition's policy goes to roll himself a smoke on his tractor, he is going to have to pay 25 per cent more excise for the pleasure of doing it. More importantly, let us look at the other people in the sugar industry, the workers. Let us look at them. What is the Opposition going to do to the workers?</PARA>

They are going to abolish the award system, and they are going to bring in the Bjelke-Petersen style voluntary agreements. We will have bayonets on the wharves, as they want us to. They will abolish holiday leave loading. They will abolish over-award payments. I challenge the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Dawson to go to Maryborough sugar mill and the mills in Proserpine, the Burdekin and Mackay and tell all the work force there that they are going to take away their award conditions and they are going to have to bargain for everything they have gained over the last 80 years. I would like to see them go and have the courage to tell them that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work force in Mackay and the Burdekin are going to be told from here to election day that they are going to lose money out of their pockets under the policies of those people on the other side of the House. I am very pleased to see what has appeared in the papers right throughout the sugar belt of the State today. It says that under the Liberals and the Nationals, the sugar industry faces chaos and uncertainty. Farms will go, and thousands of jobs will be lost. Only Wayne Goss is committed to a strong and viable Queensland sugar industry. Read it and weep! There will be people like Mick Scriha in the State Parliament after the next State election. There will be people from the Burdekin on the Labor side. Frank Gilbert will be here with us in government from Dawson after the next election, and Judy Caplick from Wide Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition can laugh. They can run with the squatters. They can support the squatters who want to underpay Australian shearers, but they do not represent the battling cane farmers. The cane farmers do not earn $55,000 to $71,000 net. They have walked away from the real farmers of this country. They have run with the squatters and they have been dragged along with the Melbourne Club and the yuppies from the Liberal Party. On Saturday they will have to face the results of their actions. In Queensland the Nationals are distancing themselves already from the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It is interesting that both leaders have both campaigned heavily in sugar seats. They have campaigned all the way up the Queensland coast. Let us see the result on Saturday. Let us see what Fightback is really about when the figures come up on the tally boards. </PARA>

If the honourable member for Hinkler wants to talk about the workers in Queensland, ask him where the Labor Party stands in connection with the workers and 151,000 people unemployed at this time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return to talking about the things that affect the sugar industry at the moment. I believe that the sugar industry has the most conscientious and the most dedicated workers&mdash;they are people who attach themselves to their industry&mdash;of any industry in Australia and the benefits have been reaped by Australia in more ways than one. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can go back 10 years and indicate to honourable members that at one stage the sugar industry, together with the coal industry in the electorate of Dawson, supplied 4 per cent of Australia's exports and 26 per cent of Queensland's exports. That was a time when the sugar industry was encouraged. The sugar industry also has decentralised the population. It probably gives direct benefit to 20,000 Australians. With the flow-on effect, probably about 100,000 people throughout the breadth of Queensland and New South Wales derive their living in some way or other from the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the sugar industry has introduced some fine people to Australia. It is the best integrator of any industry in the world of the ethnics who have come to Australia, postwar and prewar. We talk about the Solomon Islanders: those people are part of the community; they are Australians and still involved in it. We talk about the Maltese and the Italians: they are integrated Australians brought together by this great industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the fortunes of the sugar industry in the last 10 years. I want to remind every person who is a cane farmer and who has been subject to those fortunes that I have just been attributing the blame to where it belongs. In the last 10 years the people in the industry have found out that everything the Federal Labor Government has stood for has been designed to knock not only the sugar industry but every rural industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the people who were directing that process at that time. We have had some great comments here today. We have had the comment about the Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland, Mr Casey, being a person who had an empathy for the sugar industry. Mr Casey is dedicated to deregulation and has implemented it. His experience comes from the fact that his carrying company was liquidated about 15 years ago and paid 13c in the dollar. That is the type of expertise that is being brought to the sugar industry by way of the Government's intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Federal Government's intervention. I have just talked about the honourable member for Hinkler. The Minister in charge of primary industry at the time, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), also was steeped in the Public Service more than he was in agriculture. The present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is steeped in the union movement but not in agriculture. When one talks about an understanding of the situation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) never had a real job in his life. On top of that, the Government has forced on to people the commissioners of the Industry Commission, who never leave the surroundings of Canberra and live in ivory castles. They can give a description of the sugar industry and what is good for it without even setting a foot on a cane farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen the devastation that has been caused by Labor&mdash;the devastation of the income equalisation deposits so that they are of no benefit whatsoever; taking away drought from the list of natural disasters; implementing more taxes, day by day, hand over fist; and high interest rates. I have compared Australian interest rates over the last 10 years with those of the USA, a major competitor in sugar, and on average the Queensland farmer has been paying about 14 per cent whereas in the United States the average has been about 7 per cent&mdash;all of this to prop up the dollar, and that itself tells against the industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition sees the Industry Commission report as part of its bible, an integral part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document known as `the gospel according to John Hewson'. The Opposition damns non-believers to the back bench, as is the case with the honourable member for Dawson. Opposition policy supports the Industry Commission report, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document in table 4.1 enunciates that very clearly. It mentions the elimination of tariffs for rural industries. Opposition members cannot contradict that here, but they do when they get outside. They will not negotiate; they will not talk to the sugar industry. The Leader of the National Party came up my way&mdash;not to my electorate, but to the next electorate. What did he do? He did not talk to the sugar industry people; he climbed Mount Warning. Let me mention a couple of examples. In the famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview, the Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well before you come to the tariff aspect, we are eight years off negligible tariffs. . . </PARA>

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, exchange rates will have a big impact on the practical level of protection. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is how honourable members opposite slip and slide around. They are not talking about negligible tariffs; they are talking about negligible protection through the exchange rate. They do not tell the sugar growers that the exchange rate can go up and down, so it could be plus or minus negligible protection, not zero tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a bloke up in Queensland, a fellow called Katter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion which calls for recognition for, and acknowledges the outstanding contribution of, the Australian sugar industry should have been an opportunity for bipartisan support for an outstanding Australian industry. But it did not take the mover, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), very long to ensure that it degenerated into a political debate; and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who is just leaving the chamber, could not find a single constructive thing to say about this great Australian industry. All he could do was give a series of criticisms of other people's policy, without recognising the primary role that Labor has played in the downgrading of the Australian sugar industry over recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar is indeed an important Australian industry. The importance of the sugar industry is not just a farm issue. At least 30 Queensland and New South Wales cities and towns are critically dependent upon this industry. It is a concentrated industry. It is a monoculture in many areas and there are few opportunities for diversification for those who are involved. There are many small farms. It is an integrated industry critically revolving around strategically placed mills, and so it is an industry that is very important to the areas where it is serviced. It trades in a corrupt world environment. Every other country has tariffs, quotas, import bans, subsidies or other measures which make the free trading of Australian sugar very difficult indeed. So this industry is entitled to recognition in Australia for its contribution, but it is also entitled to a constructive consideration of the difficulties that it faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion was introduced by the honourable member for Hinkler, chairman of the Labor Party's rural task force. That ought to be an important position, particularly in the Labor Party, which has no tradition of involvement in the rural sector at all. No-one is remotely interested in the affairs of Australian farmers. This is seen particularly in the fact that Labor has a Minister whose only contribution to the rural sector has been to organise strikes and disruption to the progress of our products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler often speaks with pride of his sugar industry heritage. But he is very quick to pass out abuse to farm leaders and others who do in fact make really constructive contributions to this country. He called the Cattlemen's Union `dills', the UGA `law breakers', the Burnett grain growers `clowns' and the cane industry `laggards'. Is it any wonder that there should be such a response from these industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattlemen's Union has passed a motion of no confidence. The Local Government Association in his own electorate has censured him. The Kilkivan Shire Council wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) asking for him to be removed and now on Tuesday, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS>, there is the headline `Farmers censure Courtice'. The Queensland Grain Growers Association has added to the list of those condemning this man for his total lack of consideration of the rural sector. As we look at the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS>, we see that Graham Pressland, one of those quoted, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Courtice's reply will be that we are National Party lackeys, just because we have no respect for him or the job that he was supposed to do.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it any surprise, then, that last night it did not take long for the prophecy to be fulfilled? The honourable member for Hinkler, in the adjournment debate, again delivered a tirade of abuse about Mr Pressland&mdash;who, I might add, lives in his own electorate&mdash;and not only called him a lackey of the National Party but also said that he was involved with the League of Rights, the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate Action Party. I wish he would make up his mind as to where these people might all be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is the kind of approach that we have from the leader of the Labor Party's primary industry task force. This is the gentleman who has been put in charge of the task force to develop a new policy for the sugar industry. Now he comes in here and accuses this side of politics of advocating a zero tariff policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at his own record. Let us not forget, firstly, that it is Labor that lifted the sugar embargo that had been in place for 50 years. It is Labor that welshed on the agreement for tariff reductions with the sugar industry. It is the Labor Party that has made every single reduction in sugar tariffs in the history of the industry and it is the Labor Party whose Industry Commission has made the recommendation that we should move to zero tariffs by 1997 and totally deregulate the industry. It is Labor's Industry Commission that has made those recommendations, not our side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the personal record of the honourable member for Hinkler. What does he think on this question? On 6 September 1989 in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) the honourable member for Hinkler, speaking about sugar tariffs, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the benefits of unilaterally moving to lower rates of assistance are immense. By going it alone, by not waiting for other laggards in the protection game, we increase the competitiveness of our own industries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the honourable member for Hinkler said. Again, on 8 May, he lauded the benefits to the sugar industry of cutting tariffs. On 4 September 1991 he still had not changed his mind. Speaking on sugar tariffs, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the best thing that ever happened to the sugar industry because it has given us a bit more effectiveness and competition.</PARA>
<PARA>He then advocated moving on to even further reductions of the sugar industry tariffs. That is his approach. He also favours getting rid of regulation in the industry. On 6 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains the case that the sugar industry is rigidly and tightly controlled. This control acts to diminish the efforts and returns of dedicated and competent growers . . . It remains the case that it is the individuals, the producers and the sons and daughters of producers who make up the sugar industry&mdash;who are clearly disadvantaged by the current industry structure.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the man who is in charge of the current industry task force, a man who consistently advocates zero tariffs and who consistently advocates deregulation of the industry. What comfort have the people in the sugar industry got? This man is conducting the inquiry by the industry task force. What hypocrisy for him to come out with this kind of advertisement today&mdash;that under the Liberal and National parties the sugar industry faces chaos and uncertainty. He says that farms will go. How many farms have gone under Labor? Thousands. He says that thousands of jobs will go. Under Labor thousands have already gone and the economy of the industry has been utterly destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should not think that there has been some miraculous change of heart by members of the Labor Party over recent days; that they have suddenly reformed on the road to Damascus; that they think that going from 240 per cent tariff down to 15 per cent tariff in the car industry is okay but to go any further is awful. Just in case there is any doubt, honourable members should listen to what the Prime Minister had to say at the Press Club luncheon this week. Again he reaffirmed that Labor was moving towards zero tariffs. That is its objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no comfort for the sugar industry in what Labor offers to the Australian sugar growers. Government members are keen to quote what Fightback says about the future of primary industry. Maybe they should quote what we will, in fact, do for the sugar industry. We do not have a one-arm industry policy like Labor. We do not believe in unilateral tariff reductions. We do not believe in zero tariffs and doing nothing, as Labor has been doing, to cut industry costs. It has failed to do anything about the enormous cost burden on farmers. Indeed, Labor has actually raised the taxes that farmers have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, under Fightback, farmers can look forward to enormous gains. The NFF said so. The Government's own Treasury documents put the figure for gains to farmers at over $1 billion. The cane industry will be a major beneficiary too. ASL said so and it rebutted every single word that the honourable member for Hinkler has said about that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what we will do for farmers. We will give them cheaper diesel and petrol on their farms and off farms. We will give them lower freight costs, on farm and off farm. We will abolish wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax that sugar mills pay and the training guarantee levy that sugar mills pay and that other people involved in the industry have paid. We will give them significant tax cuts and, because sugar industry workers are low paid people, they will get the biggest benefits from our tax cuts. The Government will give no tax cuts to people on incomes below $20,000. We will. That will benefit the cane industry considerably. We will give rebates on GST for farm and business imports. We will get rid of the WST monkey off the farmers' backs. We will increase family allowances. We will ease the assets test for people retiring on their farms. We will improve depreciation allowances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992 had its genesis in the demise on 5 May this year of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. The lack of understanding, interest and support to provide resource security to the forest industries is an indictment of decisions made during the past decade regarding these industries. Commitments were made and broken; made and broken repeatedly. Trust between the industry and governments, and not just the Federal Government, has reached rock bottom. This Bill gives us the opportunity to restore much needed confidence in Australia's second largest manufacturing industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to this Bill, Mr Bain of the National Association of Forest Industries has stated in a letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that this is the type of simple legislation that is required at the Commonwealth level to provide bankable resource security and lead to major industry development. I am sure its passage through Parliament would be welcomed by Industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The first object of this legislation is to facilitate cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to forest industries and, where appropriate, to assist in furthering the objects of relevant State laws by providing Commonwealth recognition of the responsibilities of the States in relation to land use issues and to facilitate investment in forest programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aim is to establish procedures and conditions concerning the granting of resource security, if necessary on a regional basis, to forest programs on public and private land and to prevent the exercise of Commonwealth decision making powers in relation to forest programs otherwise than in the exceptional circumstances provided for in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the 1991 Forest Conservation and Development Bill, this Bill represents a hands-off approach by the Commonwealth. The main features of the Bill are, firstly, that there is no limitation to the application of the powers of any of our present heritage or environmental legislation at the Federal level, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protection Act 1984, section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the Export Control Act 1982 or the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, resource security under this legislation would be available to projects large or small. Projects of less than $100m would be covered and the 1,200 sawmillers throughout Australia would, on application, be covered by this legislation. Thirdly, major projects, together with State or regional plans, could be submitted by State governments to the Federal Government where proponents were seeking resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, to ensure that applications for resource security are dealt with expeditiously, a reasonable period of 12 months is set for the Commonwealth to assess the application. During this period the application of all relevant Commonwealth legislation would be considered. At the end of the 12-month assessment period, the Commonwealth would either provide resource security or decline the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, to enable an efficient approach by State and Commonwealth agencies to processing the application and making the appropriate assessments, the Bill requires, as far as practicable, the coordination and integration of the processes of assessment by State and Commonwealth officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, once an application has been granted resource security, the only proviso that would trigger withdrawal of resource security would be the discovery of some previously unknown species and that continued forestry activities were considered a major threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the event that withdrawal of resource occurred, this Bill provides for compensation to be made. Such compensation would be such sum or consideration that, having regard to the circumstances, the designated Ministers determine is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the process for making an application for resource security. This legislation establishes a clear administrative process for proponents of a forestry development who seek Federal resource security. Application for resource security could be made for new projects or existing industries wishing to expand or extend their operations. An application could be made on behalf of a single proposal or on behalf of several operators. This would allow a group of small operators, for example, country sawmillers, in a particular region to come jointly and seek resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proposal for resource security would firstly be put to the relevant State government. The State government would then undertake all studies and make the appropriate assessments before formalising its application to the Commonwealth. It is here noted that an application could be made only by a State government. Land use issues are State matters and, clearly, conservation and development with regard to forests is a land use issue and, therefore, should be dealt with by State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering proposals, the States should be cognisant of possible Federal considerations and assessments and ensure that duplication of effort is minimised. In particular, where environmental impact studies are required at both State and Federal levels, then they should be completed jointly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon the States completing their assessment of the proposal, an application would be made to the Commonwealth. On receipt of the application for resource security, the Commonwealth would have 12 months to give consideration to approving or rejecting the application. It would be expected that a decision would be made within the 12-month period, but if the 12-month period expired and certain considerations by the appropriate agencies or departments had not been completed, they would be deemed to have been completed under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After consideration of all Commonwealth decision making powers and the completion of relevant assessments or the expiry of 12 months, an instrument in writing would be made if resource security is given. The instrument would specify the period for which it would be in force and would be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of the House after the making of the instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been extensive consultation in the preparation of this legislation. Within the forest industry there is a common view throughout Australia that this legislation is balanced and would provide the security that is desperately needed. It accommodates the concerns and difficulties that arose during the debate of the Forest Conservation and Development Act 1991, and takes into consideration the Resource Assessment Commission report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Forest and Timber Inquiry Final Report March 1992</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia could reduce its balance of payments deficit by 10 per cent if security of resource could be provided to the forest industries. Business confidence is at a low ebb, unemployment is unacceptably high to both sides of this House, and we all agree that our overseas debt must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this legislation would symbolise to business that legislators had found a balance between conservation and development and had the courage to make decisions that were in the interest of the great majority of Australians. In the first reading stage of this Bill, I sought a response for any improvements to this Bill from Government and Opposition members. Coalition members fully support this legislation and, as no suggestions for improvements have come from Government members, I trust that today we will see a bipartisan approach and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event of an election intervening before the passage of this Bill and the Bill lapsing, a coalition government on coming into office would resubmit the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wednesday, 16 September 1992, was a most significant day in Australia's political history. It saw the collapse of Margaret Thatcher's rationalist economic theories in Great Britain, demonstrating to Australians what they can expect from the Fightback package of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), which slavishly apes the policies that have brought Great Britain to economic ruin. It saw the publication by the Catholic Bishops of Australia of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Wealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS>, in which the Liberal Party's market dominated philosophy of `greed is good' was firmly rejected. This followed the analysis by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission that comprehensively condemned the Fightback package as immoral. Then we saw the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) of the Government's future tax agenda, which puts taxation forward as one of the major issues at the next election. Australians will now have a choice between a Keating government, which has on the table credible promises for what the Leader of the Opposition concedes are extremely generous income tax cuts for the overwhelming majority of Australians, and the Opposition's promise to punish them with a $27 billion goods and services tax which would equal 50 per cent of the current income tax collected.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Liberal's response to that move was the announcement by Premier Groom of proposals to mine the south-west conservation areas and to guarantee the mining companies huge compensation if, by chance, these areas received World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to this pitiful excuse for a Bill that the Opposition seeks to introduce into this Parliament today in some pathetic attempt to save the seat of Lyons at the next Federal election. I say `pathetic' because I believe that the electors of Lyons will not be fooled by the political posturing of either the Federal Liberal Party or the Tasmanian Premier. Moreover, the electorates of Denison and Franklin, which enjoy the most powerful green vote in Australia, will also be responding to the environmental vandalism inherent in this puny Bill, as will the millions of Australians in marginal seats around the country who will be ensuring that their preferences do not go to a political party whose objective is to destroy Australia's great national parks, be they in Tasmania, the Northern Territory or New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no second prizes in politics. In November 1991, when the Government introduced the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, the Opposition in combination with the Democrats defeated it in the Senate. That was not because the Opposition had any time for the Democrats' green position. On the contrary, the Leader of the Opposition was merely playing a rather transparent political game seeking to be all things to all voters. His excuse for defeating the legislation was that he did not like the title of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been clear for some time now that, while the Australian electorate is very concerned to protect and develop our industries, it is no longer prepared to permit the vandalism and desecration of our natural environment. Jobs are all important, but political parties which seek to sacrifice our children's heritage to gain some short term political advantage will be firmly rejected by the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians know that the Liberals' promises are totally inadequate when it comes to the protection of our endangered species. Native forests are an essential asset in maintaining the biodiversity that ecologists tell us is essential if large numbers of our plants and animals are not to face extinction. Those forests are already at great risk from woodchipping and other timber-getting activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that I was the greatest fan of the Government's Bill, but one of its features was that it took the first steps towards abandoning wood extraction from native forests in favour of making Australia self-sufficient in the production of paper fibre from plantations. This Bill will do nothing towards achieving the tremendous potential to exploit modern technology advances and so maximise yields from plantation material, instead of devastating our pristine wilderness areas. This Bill will do nothing towards maintaining the conservation values of our native forests or enhancing the tourist potential of those forests. It will do nothing to protect our soils and water values in the forests or prevent degradation by soil erosion, salinity or flooding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill represents the Liberal Party's jettisoning of the green vote. It is a blatant attempt by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) to save face with their bankrollers from the mining lobby and the timber lobbies for their appalling performance in the Senate on the issue of resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition earned the contempt and the scathing criticism of the Liberal Government of Tasmania as well as its political backers in the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania, which monstered the Opposition's actions in defeating the Bill in the Senate on a meaningless and totally trivial point. These Liberals and their supporters condemned their Federal colleagues for denying Tasmanians jobs. The contrast was clear between a government that was prepared to see the development of the new wood pulp industries&mdash;but only if our environmental heritage was protected&mdash;and an indecisive, politically inept Opposition which ended up adopting the worst of all possible options, roundly offending the timber lobby and conservationists alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of yesterday's decision by the Tasmanian Liberal Government to mine its national parks, what decent Australian could support the object of this Bill, which is to give conservative State governments completely open slather to despoil and desecrate our natural environment and Aboriginal cultural history? Such philistine behaviour is perfectly consistent with the Opposition's mining and timber policies generally. It is true that the Leader of the Opposition has backed off his threat to sandmine Fraser Island, but he is still committed to giving open slather to uranium mining&mdash;including the World Heritage area of Kakadu National Park. He is also committed to establishing a uranium enrichment industry as well as a nuclear power industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is really no end to the fanaticism and zealotry of the Leader of the Opposition. Here is a man whose life is totally committed to an obsession with free market economics.

Social values such as environmental protection do not figure in the Liberals' thinking. The use and philosophy of `greed is good' was comprehensively debunked by Australia's Catholic bishops in their statement delivered by His Eminence Cardinal Clancy yesterday.

That was a decision that was supported by all Australians at election time and the Hawke Government was resoundingly returned. </PARA>

Clearly, when the Government brought in a Bill to try to cover all the factions within the Labor Party&mdash;we have just heard the looney Left of the Labor Party give its particular biased point of view on the Bill and why the Government was not able to bring forward a decent piece of legislation&mdash;the Bill got thrown out because it was not workable and the industry did not want it; the industry gave no support to it. </PARA>

All these people recommended this Bill. All these people said it was workable and would invest in Australia for Australian jobs, and that is what we are on about&mdash;creating jobs and using our resources wisely to have investment in this country. </PARA>

Where is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) or the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr)? Where are they? Their electorates have got the big timber concerns, but we will not get one word out of them. Why not? Because they are embarrassed; they are embarrassed about the Government not supporting this legislation. That is why they will probably not be here after the next election. They know this legislation is about jobs. What the Government has quite clearly done by not bringing in decent resource security is to export jobs to Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines. That is where the jobs have gone; that is where the new pulp and paper mills have been built. </PARA>

Having witnessed the spectacle of the Opposition's performance on that occasion and having listened to the contributions by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) in the House today, I find it obvious that the Opposition is having the same degree of flexibility in this matter as it is having in its approach to its tax package, the Hewson tax package.</PARA></TALK.START>

This Bill before the House has serious deficiencies. Unlike the Government's Bill, which the coalition defeated, this Bill is a nothing. The Labor Party Bill provided appropriate safeguards to identify and protect endangered species. The Labor Bill provided the balance in the forest debate regarding which forests should be conserved and which should be managed for wood production.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember some years ago, when I used to go along to confession, I used to say not, `I am sorry'; I used to say, `Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill itself, in this perfunctory process in particular, is nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Braddon and his cohorts to save face after their appalling performance on the issue of resource security. Much has already been said and written about the issue of resource security. After the Opposition's acrobatic performance in the Senate on this issue, Australians have every right to scorn the Opposition for killing off the Government's legislation. The Opposition's vote against that legislation was a vote&mdash;and honourable members should listen carefully&mdash;against jobs for Australians.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)recognises the richness and diversity of traditional Aboriginal culture; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)determines that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure that Australia finally sheds any and all racist overtones in every sector of our society.</PARA>
<PARA>In March of this year, one more major instance of racism in Australia was blazoned across the media of Australia. At that time, New South Wales police force members screened two videos parodying black deaths in custody. That report gave many Australians pause for thought, and for many it came as a shock. But one does not have to scratch the Australian psyche very deep to discover that particularly with reference to our indigenous people there is a strong racist component to Australian community character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is past time that we asked the question: why is Australian society diminished by such racist attitudes? It is not because Australians have inherent qualities of nastiness or unfairness which lead them to discriminate thus. On the contrary, I believe that most Australian people are generous to a fault, ready to respond in an instant to any appeal to the heart or the purse strings in instances where fellow Australians or Africans or Asian people are in crisis situations. I also believe that the majority of Australians would angrily reject allegations of racism&mdash;even those who precede judgment made on the basis of race, rather than of personal knowledge, with the disclaimer, `I'm not a racist, but'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ugly head of racism within our society reared itself within my electorate about five years ago when an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sporting corporation was striving to secure a home ground for a football club run for the benefit of both young murris and non-Aboriginal children within the area. I supported that attempt. The result was devastating. It was an eye-opener to me. People whom I have held in respect&mdash;and still do, in other circumstances&mdash;grouped together against me. They were ringing me late at night, they were harassing me, and they were saying they would not vote for me, just because I supported an attempt for Aboriginal children to have sporting facilities within the local area. The supposition that murri children playing football with non-Aboriginal children within the electorate of Lilley would result in a virtual slums area, as large numbers of murris strove to come into our area&mdash;and they would be welcome&mdash;really brought home to me that when we are talking about reconciliation, when we are talking about recognition, we are not talking about more than 200 years in the past, we are talking about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that much of the blame for such a situation rests on the education system. The most infamous Big Brother act in Australian history has surely been the sanitising of the first 200 years of white history to cast the European invaders in the best possible light. It started in the eighteenth century and, in fact, it was preceded by the concept of the noble savage. It started with the perceptions of one white adventurer, William Dampier, who declared that the Aborigines of Western Australia were `naked, miserable stragglers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adverse effects of this statement would not be so pronounced had they not been compounded since then by the myths fed to Australian school children by generations of white observers, educators and historians. Australian history written as recently as in the last three decades clearly shows that the myths of peaceful European settlement of Aboriginal land in the Southern Hemisphere have been perpetuated by succeeding generations of white bureaucrats and historians. They have effectively denied Aboriginals a place in our history by refusing to record white actions and policies as they actually were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, when an early history of New South Wales declared that settlers had not established themselves by the sword nor willingly done injury to the aforementioned `naked, miserable stragglers', two inaccurate sets of so-called facts were firmly established for readers at that time. One was that the European invasion of Australia was peaceful and the other was that blacks were `miserable stragglers'. One led to a myth which denies, even today, the white destruction of the Aboriginal heritage. The other is part of a widespread defamation of the Aboriginal character which is part of a global pattern of racial stereotyping which was undoubtedly a factor in the riots in Los Angeles earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The myths have become part of the Australian psyche, denying a clear, unshuttered view of current social conditions and depriving generations of white Australians of the cultural richness and practical advantages of knowing Aboriginal people, their kinship system, their social organisation, their love of and care for the environment, and their history. So the misrepresentation of our history over two centuries has much to answer for. Bureaucratic action has compounded the effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we cannot lean comfortably back on what we believe our ancestors have done, quite often from a basis of misinformation. We have to come to terms with the fact that there was a European invasion. We must not gag on the idea of an invasion. We must not turn to gentler, more kindly interpretations, such as indigenous people peacefully stepping aside and allowing us to take over. We must move forward. We must go beyond the point of talking about and deploring the situation to ensure that we are setting in place programs that are looking at the changing of attitudes. We must start by recognising the injustice that has been perpetrated on murris and kooris so that it becomes the basis for enabling our own children to have the information in schools which will give them an understanding and an appreciation of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

It is a motion that I think most honourable members would support, but one of the eternal problems in this particular area is to be able to put flesh and real action on the thing that we all desire: to improve the lot of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came to this place 2 1/2 years ago with really no knowledge of the situation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. I think most, nearly all, Australians find themselves in that position. At the behest of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), I joined the Standing Committee for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Recently I became its Deputy Chairman. In the two years or so that I have been on that Committee, I have participated in the compilation of two major reports&mdash;the language maintenance report which the previous speaker referred to and one on a inquiry into support services for urban dwelling Aboriginal people which we are about to report on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most Australians, I am well aware of the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I think that brought the terrible situation of many of our indigenous people in this country home to a broader audience than probably any other single document in the history of this country. I have recently been appointed as the coalition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation&mdash;the only member of this chamber on that Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From all of these activities that I have been involved in and my travel, which has been very extensive, around the country on a number of these inquiries and such matters, I have seen some of the good things about our indigenous community and I have seen some of the very difficult and bad things that have been inflicted on it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three elements of this motion. The first part deplores the enormous injustice perpetrated on Aboriginal Australians at the time of the European invasion. Most Australians celebrate 26 January 1788 as Australia Day. We could look at it from a different perspective. If, today, foreign ships came here and bombed and shot us, occupied our land, stole our property, beat us, raped our women and killed our families, if they forcibly removed our children and forbade us to speak our own language, the nation from which they came would be condemned in the eyes of the world. We would all regard those who resisted as heroes. Even as time went by, we would not forget but would continue to resist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus it was for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. No treaty was concluded with the inhabitants 204 years ago, when the British came here, as it was in most other British colonies. There was no recognition that the indigenous people had been here for tens of thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an assumption that, because the culture was different, it must be inferior. Because the customs were different, there was an assumption that there was no need to recognise them. I have to say that, by the standards of the day, the British colonists actually did not behave all that badly in many ways. Today's descendants are not personally to blame, but we should recognise that it happened. We should recognise that whole communities were shot or forcibly removed from their land. We should recognise it in our lifetime&mdash;in my lifetime and your lifetime, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were still taking young children forcibly from their Aboriginal parents. We should recognise the impact that has had on parenting of the current generation. We should recognise the impact that has had on Aboriginal family life. We should recognise the impact that an alien and more powerful culture has imposed on our indigenous people. We should recognise the impact of the introduced diseases. The whole community in this country needs to understand what was stated in the preamble to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act which was passed in this place last year. In part, that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years, before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders suffered dispossession and dispersal from their traditional lands by the British Crown; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)to date, there has been no formal process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and other Australians. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second part of the motion is that this House `recognises the richness and diversity of traditional Aboriginal culture'. All culture is a living thing. It is not fossilised, and it will change over time. It seems to me that one of the things that have damaged our Aboriginal culture so badly&mdash;apart from that long list of things I have already referred to as continuing to damage the culture&mdash;is the impact of television. It is television that gets out to every far corner of this country and it is suborning indigenous culture in a major way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley referred to the importance of language. Two hundred and four years ago there were 260 different Aboriginal languages in this country. Now there are only about 20 that are spoken by any reasonable number of people. Remote communities tend to retain their language and their culture better. They tend to retain their ceremonies and dance. There are modern developments, and perhaps the best single example is Yothu Yindi. Because most of us do not understand the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture it does not make it any the less valid or relevant for the indigenous people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the motion today is that this House `determines that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure that Australia finally sheds any and all racist overtones in every sector of our society'. Should we have time in the debate, my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson)  will elaborate on this aspect of the motion in particular. I just want to say that it is sometimes suggested that Europeans did not invade, that we found an empty land, and that just because the inhabitants before the British came did not measure up in terms of our recognisable culture and civilisation there was nothing here and we could just walk into that vacant land&mdash;so-called terra nullius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Mabo decision has changed that, and on another day I will elaborate on that matter. As I said before, we would react very strongly if another nation came here with superior weapons and took over, moved us away, forbade our language, took our children away and so on. We would feel that was unjust. So does the Aboriginal community, because it happened to them, just like that, 200 years ago. Their treatment as second-class citizens has simply continued to this day in so many different ways. Our treatment of indigenous people has resulted in poor health, housing and education, high unemployment rates on a permanent basis and all the litany of other problems that have been articulated so often in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most telling statistic is that today in 1992 an Aboriginal person in this country has a life expectancy 20 years lower than that of any other member of this Australian community. It seems to me that summarises or encapsulates the whole problem. It has been continuing for a long time. The net results have been clearly demonstrated in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Yet we must remember it was only 25 years ago that the indigenous people were really treated like flora and fauna, not as people. In fact, we had a referendum to allow them to move around without passes, to allow them to vote, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is long and inglorious injustice in terms of the way we have treated our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We should deplore it and we should start to do something about it. It is manifested in health and education services, in job discrimination, in housing discrimination. A good example is the over-representation of the Aboriginal community in gaol. Of course, we have seen those quite disgraceful television instances the the honourable member for Lilley referred to. I have to say that among many in the Aboriginal community all of those injustices, both historical and continuing, still rankle. Frankly, if all honourable members were in that position it would rankle with them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion calls for Australia to finally shed any and all racist overtones, in every sector of our society. It seems to me that this is best done by education and persuasion&mdash;not just by legislation&mdash;and action at the local level. That is why I believe that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is so important. It has adopted a vision, and the vision statement for the Council will be `A united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and equity for all'. The goal of the Council is to prepare the nation to own the Council's vision by the year 2001. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has often been said by people, both in this House and in the society generally, that one cannot legislate to change social attitudes. I think that is quite incorrect, if one actually has a look at the evidence that has been demonstrated in this country, particularly over the last 20 years. The package of legislation that this Government has introduced over the last decade sends a very important signal to our community and to our society. We, as parliamentarians, are supposed to reflect the views, attitudes and will of the electorate. Parliaments throughout this country, through our democratic society, are supposed to be a reflection of the will of the society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, when this Parliament or any of the parliaments in this country put forward legislation which is designed to assist in the process of social change and in the changing of attitudes, that does reflect the will and determination of our society that we must address these issues. In the last decade, we have implemented some legislation along that path. I refer particularly to the anti-discrimination legislation, the equal opportunity legislation and, more particularly in this term of Parliament, the legislation that the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) referred to, for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things are designed to, in fact, make a change in social attitudes, to try to ensure that we do have a community that is free of discrimination, that is free of racism, and that does have a commitment to positive change, so that all Australians living in this society have some opportunity to have equal access to all of the benefits of our society. It is very important that we demonstrate a commitment to that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of a Federal Labor government and a State Labor government has caused not only the destruction of industry and jobs throughout Victoria but also misery to family after family. Probably the best example of that misery comes out of the debate on the car industry and tariffs. How close to home is this issue to me? Two members of my fire brigade lose their jobs this week. It is a small fire brigade and two members are to lose their jobs. Their jobs are in the car industry; they work for the Nissan company. I want to show you some figures on jobs later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distortion of the arguments that have been heard in this House over the last two weeks cannot go unanswered. The people of Australia are the ones who pay for the impost of tariffs on this country. The ones who pay are the Australian car buyers, from school leavers buying their first car to families buying a station wagon, to small businessmen buying a ute, a van or a business sedan, to the mining and agricultural sectors buying equipment and vehicles. All the tax imposts that this Government still continues to have on business across this country are stifling the opportunity for jobs. I am grieving because they are especially affecting my State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the people on the bottom rung of the social and economic ladder are hurt the most because their access to better educational and employment opportunities are necessarily limited and they are being locked into the despair of an increasingly permanent underclass. That should not be tolerated in a nation with the abundant natural advantages and wealth which Australia has and enjoys today. The people on the other side of the House have chosen to ignore the imposts on business and, therefore, the effects on jobs. They actually come into this House and berate the Opposition over a package called Fightback that is specifically designed to reduce the costs to business and the car industry so that we can compete with our neighbours and sell into Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that on 27 May 1992 the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice)&mdash;and I thank him for attending&mdash;said that after reduction of costs, chemicals and textile fabric will be imported duty free when used in the chemicals, plastics, book binding and allied industries. He said that this action would also assist the international competitiveness of these industries. He went on to say that one of the companies in his electorate, the Bundaberg Bag Co., was doing extremely well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This item will allow it to be more competitive in using some of these products and to value add and sell the finished product not only into the Australian market but also into the expanding Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is it that the honourable member for Hinkler does not realise that the cost of fuel excise and the cost of wholesale sales tax on every motor vehicle impacts on every part of the production process and is an impost on businesses? Why does the honourable member for Hinkler not realise that the cost of payroll tax to businesses is costing jobs in this nation? Yet he wonders why I am offended when I grieve for what has happened in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, on a recent occasion one honourable member brought a package of shopping into this House to show the taxes that were imposted. I know we are not meant to bring in things such as that, but I have brought in a graph. This graph in my hand is a graph of unemployment in Corinella. The honourable member for Hinkler, if he looks up, will see why I am grieving. This is the tragedy of unemployment in my electorate of Corinella. In 1990 there were just over 2,000 people. In 1992 there were nearly 12,000 people and rising, with another 104 last month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why am I upset about new tax and imposts on business? Because of what has just been announced on the 12 o'clock news on 3AW. Senator Button has admitted that car fleet sales may be affected by the extension of FBT. He said a bit earlier that businesses making fleet purchases will be the big losers because of the Government's decision to tighten FBT; so another decision yesterday, thrown together in 36 hours by the Government, impacts on the car industry. Another tax on the car industry comes right back into my electorate, and jobs go in my electorate. I could say to the honourable member for McEwen that there will be jobs missing in her electorate, too, because of this Government's imposts of taxes upon the car industry and upon every other industry in Australia. When are people going to understand that the Fightback package put together by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) takes costs from business and allows the opportunity for people to be employed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just those employed within the car industry that suffer from tax imposts; it is every other small business that those people deal with.

My heart was torn when I picked up this copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. `A plea from the heartland' is an article written by Glenda Lofts on 24 July. She made a plea from the heartland, a plea from the small traders and hard workers of this State to help understanding in difficult times. She kept a diary on the reaction. I reacted to Glenda Lofts, because I knew what Glenda Lofts was going through in her small shoe store. When I read it, I knew how she was being pressured by the bank. I knew how her sales had declined. I knew what her buying group was saying to her. I knew that she was having sleepless nights. When I read her `plea from the heartland' article, I had to put pen to paper. I wrote her a personal letter. She kept a diary of what happened, and she was thrilled enough to say, `More calls and letters, one from the Federal member for Corinella. He is a retailer and he understands'. Yes, I understand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other tragedy, in my view, is that we in Australia have been very slow to value add. Australia has always been good at digging things up and exporting them or growing things and exporting them, but we have been slow to take that next step of putting that extra value onto goods.

We should be putting extra value on and getting extra money for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess every honourable member could quote their favourite example, and one of mine is prawns. Prawns purchased in Australia, for a few dollars per kilo, are sent to Taiwan where they are wrapped in flour and breadcrumbs and imported back into this country by two of our major food chains and sold at ten times the cost. With due respect to Taiwan, I suggest that they could be wrapped in flour and have breadcrumbs sprinkled on them under much more hygienic conditions in Australia than they would in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in my electorate I attended an official function and on the table were bottles of natural spring water. My eye was attracted to what appeared to be foreign writing on the label. I brought this wrapper in. It is a bit squashed but I took it off the bottle. On closer examination I found that the water in this bottle which was at this official function was imported by Nippy's Fruit Juices of Arncliffe, New South Wales, but bottled by PT Tirta Manik Cemerlang of Indonesia. It was the sole exporter and distributor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a great admirer of Indonesia. I am a student of its history and culture, but one thing I would not do while I was in Indonesia would be to drink the water. I am sure that honourable members would be amazed, as I am, that in this country, where there is an abundance of water, we are importing water for drinking from Indonesia. One of the things that Australians are advised on departing for Indonesia is not to drink the local water. To say this is crazy is to put it mildly. There is the label on this bottle&mdash;we are importing drinking water to this country from Indonesia. It defies logic. I have written to the manager of Nippy's Fruit Juices asking what quantity of water for drinking purposes it imports each year from Indonesia, but to date I have not received a reply. I have also put a question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unnecessary import, in my view, is peat. Each year Australia imports almost 17,000 tonnes of peat, to the value of $2.5 million, mainly from Germany, New Zealand, Russia and Canada. The peat from Canada and Russia is dumped in Australia. Australia has an abundance of peat. Far be it from me to be parochial, but in my electorate, at Burrawang near Robertson, there is a huge deposit of peat, yet we import peat from Canada, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and what used to be the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This importation of peat from the Commonwealth of Independent States is a particular worry to me. In 1990-91 it was almost 3,000 tonnes worth $147,000. This dropped to 928 tonnes last financial year, worth only $70,000. But I understand that this peat that we import from the Commonwealth of Independent States called Novabolt is mined in the Chernobyl area. The peat that we are importing from the Commonwealth of Independent States comes from the Chernobyl area, and Department of Agriculture officers have privately expressed to me reservations about the use of this peat in mushroom growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to this chamber that there really is a certain irony in the fact that we are trying to promote our food products&mdash;and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) does a very good job at this&mdash;in Europe and the rest of the world and we provide it to Europe as Chernobyl free. That is one of our sales pitches, that it is free from nuclear fall-out. Yet, without any official protest, we could be importing contaminated peat. At the very least all peat that is imported from the Commonwealth of Independent States should be tested. If fact, it is a stupidity that Australia should be importing any peat at all. Why are we importing this, you might ask. Imported peat accounts for the majority of the Australian market. Why is it that so many Australians have a perception that imported is better? I really believe that if we are going to continue importing peat it should be labelled `This peat is imported'. Independent tests conducted by the Department of Agriculture, as well as trials conducted by mushroom growers and other users, have confirmed that our peat is at least the equal of imported peat, and the peat farm in my electorate could supply at least half of the Australian market. There is a 40-year supply of peat at Burrawang that we could supply, yet we are importing peat from all these countries all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will always need to import certain goods and I do not believe that we should develop local goods just for the sake of doing so. It is obvious that where there is a significant comparative cost advantage we should import, but there are things that we should not be importing. I have always opposed the importation, for example, of fruit juice or fruit pulp. I just cannot understand that at all. I think it is silly when we have got fruit producers here pulling out trees and we are importing Brazilian fruit pulp. I cannot understand it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have highlighted just two items. I have highlighted our importing drinking water from Indonesia, and I would challenge anyone on either side of the House to explain this one to me; I just cannot believe that at all. The final irony would be if as a gesture you gave to a friend who was going to Indonesia a bottle of water because they should not drink the local water, and you gave them a bottle of the imported Indonesian water. But, as I say, any honourable member who wants to have a look at this label is free to do so. </PARA>

He said he believed that we as a nation lack purpose and vision and that much of our incapacity to deal with the enormous problems that confront us as a nation springs from the problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The legacy of financial mismanagement left by Mr Everingham still dogs the Northern Territory today. In fact, when we look at the details of the infamous Northern Territory casino fiasco, it is no wonder he was eventually hounded out of the Territory and down to Brisbane. This deal, whereby millions of taxpayers' dollars were squandered to help a private consortium buy out Darwin and Alice Springs casinos, is the greatest financial scandal any Australian government has ever been involved in. There was no consent from parliament for the millions of taxpayers' dollars used in the exercise. The compulsory buy-out was initiated by Mr Everingham before he resigned and was blasted by colleague and successor, Mr Tuxworth, when he inherited the problem from the Everingham Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fund the casino deal, the Government raided the Treasury funds for $21m to help the consortium buy the two casinos. The Government chipped in $2 1/2m to meet the high compensation price asked by the old owners, but knew that the money could not be recovered. Further, the Northern Territory Development Corporation guaranteed a $26m loan raised by the consortium. The Government would pay an estimated $750,000 in interest on a $2m make-up loan to the consortium and waive the $1m in stamp duty. Then the Government waived the 8 per cent gaming tax, which had already been reduced from the 20 per cent paid by the former owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Everingham assured the public that their money would not be used, but two weeks after his resignation the Government was forced to reveal the details. The original owners of the casinos backed calls from the Opposition for a judicial inquiry into the affair. Despite the failure of the casinos and their forced sale, Everingham still had a grand plan for another publicly funded casino development scheme. The working title for Tuxworth's account of the post-Everingham era was `500 days of damage control'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only late source of funds that could be fuelling this unprecedented campaign by the Nats and the Libs is the infamous Kaldeal account.

It featured heavily in the proceedings of the Fitzgerald inquiry. The Nationals have now decided to share the proceeds of this Joh brown paper bag money with the Liberals.

Mr Deputy Speaker, there is one individual in particular involved in the Liberal Party campaign who needs to have the spotlight turned on him&mdash;and that is Mr Paul, Porky, Everingham. He is the Liberal Party President in Queensland and is responsible for much of what has gone on in the Liberal's campaign. He was the one who unceremoniously dumped Denver Beanland from the Liberal leadership and installed Mrs Sheldon some time ago. His assumption was that Denver did not have the stomach for the sort of dirt campaign that he intended to pollute Queensland politics with&mdash;and pollute the campaign he has.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His record as Chief Minister in the Northern Territory speaks volumes for the sort of disregard he has for the facts, ethics and even honesty. For example, in 1983 in the Northern Territory he masterminded a gerrymander that would make even old Joh Bjelke-Petersen flinch. Following his redistribution, there were seats in the Territory that were up to 20 per cent over quota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a Northern Territory money scandal which has Mr Everingham's prints all over it. While a member of this House, Mr Everingham received a $20,000 retainer from a Brisbane law firm to advise on events in the Northern Territory.

When this was revealed, Mr Everingham resigned his consultancy to the Brisbane firm. </PARA>

He was forced to resign in disgrace. Mr Everingham found him a job with the Liberals in Queensland. The Territory Ombudsman delivered a report on the event which implicated Mr Everingham and blasted him for failing to cooperate in the investigation.

I did not hear him say one single word during that debate. Obviously, he is not as interested, as he says he is. He often comes into this House and makes outrageous allegations on the run, and clearly he has lost his bearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise today to represent the constituents of the Federal seat of Moore, in particular the constituents who reside in the city of Wanneroo which is the second fastest growing municipality in Australia and the fastest in Western Australia. This area includes the new Joondalup city developments&mdash;a huge infrastructure cost to the local council&mdash;and tremendous residential developments in Clarkson, Currumbine, Quinns Rocks, Burns, Kinross and elsewhere in the city. In fact my electorate office is situated in the heart of this development and from my office window one can see the scenery change in front of one's very eyes. I deliberately chose the position for the office not only because it was at the centre of the electorate geographically, but it also made for much greater accessibility for my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wanneroo is an area where because of its residential character there are fewer opportunities for employment. This is particularly so in the bleak months we have seen of the recession that we have had, the recession that we were told we had to have by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the former Treasurer. In the four quarters for the financial year 1991-92, the average number of unemployed was 8,755 out of a labour force total of 90,717. This represents an average rate of 9.7 per cent. But there is a particular extra impact of unemployment in my electorate because of its residential nature&mdash;there are large numbers of families with children and people who have large mortgages settling into their first homes. That means that the loss of the breadwinner's wage into the household represents a much more significant blow to my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have raised the issue of the large number of unemployed is that in the recent Budget the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced the $350m local capital works program. It was alleged to be designed to allow councils in areas experiencing high and protracted levels of unemployment to undertake capital works projects that they may have the need for, but not the financial capacity to see through. In making the detailed announcement of the implementation of this program, the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) talked of the broad national coverage of the program and how the formula for allocation of funds was designed to identify and target council areas that have recently experienced higher than average rates of unemployment. Unfortunately for many of my constituents who would have expected to see the benefits rightly flow to their local municipality of the city of Wanneroo, because of the application of the formula they have seen their city receive absolutely nothing&mdash;zilch. With almost 9,000 unemployed within the boundaries of the city it has received not a cracker from this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local capital works program has been labelled as a pork-barrelling exercise in a Budget that was put together hastily as a desperate measure to try to win a few extra votes for the now discredited Keating Government. If one were to analyse where the money from the capital works program has been allocated in Western Australia there are some remarkable coincidences. For instance, in the key marginal seats of Stirling and Canning, both of whose sitting members are expected to be defeated by Liberal candidates at the next election, over $7m has been apportioned to each electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seats of Swan, Brand and Perth where sitting Labor members&mdash;or, as in the case of Perth, into which WA Inc. player and Keating apparatchik Stephen Smith has been slotted at the expense of the sitting member&mdash;$3m, $4m and $3.9m respectively have been earmarked for capital works. One does not have to be a cynic to draw the conclusion that the marginal Labor seats have been targeted. But the counter argument is that in leaving out the city of Wanneroo the seat of Cowan is affected. That, of course, is another marginal electorate which is expected to fall to the Liberal candidate Richard Evans at the next election. However, it has to be said that a large section of the electorate of Cowan does fall without the city of Wanneroo and this would be covered by the generous grants to neighbouring councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes back to the system used for the allocation of funds, there are three categories of recipients. The first uses Australian Bureau of Statistics regions and Office of Local Government regions in rural areas with a regional labour force of not less than 60,000 and four-quarter average unemployment rate September 1991 to June 1992 equal or greater than 10.9 per cent, with the June quarter at greater or equal to 11.1 per cent. The second category includes councils that satisfy the unemployment rate described in category 1 as individual councils but which are in regions that do not qualify in the first category. The third category targets councils that have had four-quarter rates of greater than or equal to 10.6 per cent with a June quarter 1992 greater or equal to 10.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must point out that the figures that are used for the assessment of eligibility are based on estimated breakdowns of the unemployed data from the CES offices in the various council areas. The city of Wanneroo fails to qualify under the above rules, notwithstanding the fact that it had an unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent over the four quarters. The city of Canning, on the other hand, in the marginal seat of Canning, with an unemployment rate of only 7.7 per cent over the four quarters, received $1.62m in the allocation from the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Travelling around the country, the municipality of Berwick in Victoria, for instance, with a comparable rate of 9.3 per cent over the four quarters, received $2.1m. The town of Melville in Western Australia, which includes parts of an important marginal State seat as well as parts of the electorate of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), was apportioned $1.7m, with a rate of unemployment of 6.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of Wanneroo is the only local authority in Australia which did not receive a grant and which had greater than 5,700 persons unemployed, based on the average over the four quarters. In fact, its 8,755 unemployed figure exceeds 5,700 by over 3,000 people. Municipalities with comparable numbers of unemployed on that basis are Logan City in Queensland, which received $3.3m; Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, which received $5.1m; Newcastle, which received $4.8m; Broadmeadows, in Victoria, received $4.8m; Sunshine, in Victoria, with $4.8m; and Salisbury, in South Australia, which received $4.2m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the view&mdash;and that is a view that is shared by the city of Wanneroo&mdash;that the methodology used in assessing the eligibility of local government authorities is flawed and has led to the exclusion of the city of Wanneroo from the program. I am no expert, but surely it would have been possible, in this day and age with the type of facilities and resources available to the Government, to model the application of various different formulae nationwide and to come up with a formula which divides up the funds in a much more equitable manner. In fact, I would have thought that, under the circumstances, such a modelling exercise would have been absolutely vital to the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My questions to the Minister for Local Government are as follows: was there any such modelling undertaken before the announcement of this program? If not, why not? If so, how many formulae were tested, and why did the Minister choose a formula that excluded the city of Wanneroo, one of the most deserving municipalities in the country? Was it possible to assess from the modelling the likely flow-on benefits to marginal Labor seats around the country and, if so, was the formula chosen by the Minister seen as the one that most assisted the ALP in the next election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a modelling exercise would involve only a fairly simple spreadsheet model, and could have been done well in advance of any announcement. However, if one were to choose between inspired effort on the part of those responsible and a stuff-up made on the run, I would probably go for the latter. The Budget was cobbled together on the run. It was a document inspired more by short term, cheap, electoral ploys than the long term interests of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the Minister to reconsider the case of the city of Wanneroo and to share the funds more equitably in the program or at least to consider and approve the Council's independent submission for important capital works programs within the city. Finally, I would like to commend the Mayor of Wanneroo, Councillor Rob Johnson, for his efforts in representing the ratepayers in his city, by immediately making the effort to represent the interests of those ratepayers to the Minister concerned.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to look at the disastrous effect that the goods and services tax would have on tourism. The 1992 Federal Budget represented the biggest ever boost to regional tourism development. The Hunter Valley, as the prime tourist destination, will be a big winner. So will all tourist destinations. Not only will we see a massive boost of tourism infrastructure, but we will see the generation of many job opportunities, particularly for young Australians. Reforms in the aviation industry mean that we will see more overseas tourists, more export earnings and more jobs. The forecast inflation rate of only 2 per cent this year will ensure that the Australian tourism industry performs more strongly in an environment where our competitors have much higher inflation levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one dark cloud on the horizon is the effect that a goods and services tax would have on the tourism industry. The tourism industry would lose massively, because all travel products and services would no longer be exempt from taxation, but would be subject to a 15 per cent tax. The GST package would add to the cost of the tourist industry by hundreds of millions of dollars per year, even after allowing for the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. Hotels, motels, air fares, bus fares, conference venues, restaurant meals, tourist guide charges, rail fares&mdash;the list is endless&mdash;all these things would be slugged with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, when the Swedish Government extended a similar tax on tourism, there was a massive 13 per cent fall in inbound tourism numbers. Sweden was forced to reduce the rate, from the beginning of this year. The GST would encourage Australians to holiday overseas rather than in their own country. This is madness. If one flies anywhere in Australia, one will pay a 15 per cent tax. If one buys a loaf of bread one will pay a 15 per cent tax. However, if one flies for a holiday to Hawaii, one will pay no tax on that air fare, no tax on that accommodation and no tax on that food. </PARA>

They can grow their own vegetables but our Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was so moved that he had to point out that gardening would become an expensive exercise indeed. With the GST, there would be a levy on gumboots, gloves, seeds, sunhats, water, fertiliser and manure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few matters I would like to speak to in this grievance debate today, but first I must take umbrage at the Member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). It is interesting that he talks about the tourist industry and how the GST, which he seems obsessed with, is going to affect the tourist industry. Unless this Government or a government in the future makes radical changes, we will all be tourists. We will be leaving Australia in droves, and it will be the last person out who turns off the lights. He is only talking about the GST, of course. He is careful not to mention Fightback too much, because the GST is just one part of the Fightback package. He mentioned pensioners. I think it is shame that the Labor Party has a scare campaign going on amongst pensioners. Under Fightback their pensions will be increased by 8 per cent, they will have access to private health care, and there are many other benefits that will be acquired by pensioners. I think the pensioners are one of the main winners in the Fightback package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I would like to speak about today is the recent Budget brought down by the Government. Most Australians were waiting for a good news Budget. They wanted to know how the Government was going to do something about the million unemployed&mdash;a million according to statistics, but we all know there are a lot more than a million people unemployed. They wanted to know how the Government was going to make it reasonable for people first of all to save and to invest; how it was going to make it reasonable for people to work. They also</PARA>
<PARA>wanted to know how the Government was going to assist small business, whether it be the small businesses that we know in small communities, in small towns or in large cities, or the farmer, who in effect is a small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we looked at the Budget, what a fizzer it was. The only people who really said anything good about the Budget were the sycophants, who always say what lovely clothes the emperor is wearing. We all know the emperor has got no clothes on. Until they realise that and tell the Australian people that, this country is going nowhere. I see the member for Hunter over there smiling. Until people like him start to realise that and start to tell his leadership that, this country is going nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that Budget, despite $9 billion additional expenditure, there were no real jobs created. It talked about having 27,000 jobs, but&mdash;and I would like this to be refuted&mdash;I heard there were another 2,500 going into the CES trying to find jobs where there were no jobs available. I may be wrong, but that is the figure I heard. Perhaps someone could fill me in on that. There was nothing in that Budget that created real jobs in Australia&mdash;permanent jobs, to get people off the dole queues. The only thing it did was to get those dole queues educated in one way and another. It had training to try to hide the actual unemployment figures, but the Australian electorate is too smart for that. They could see right through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) speaking about the job creation schemes in the various local government areas throughout Australia. Many, of course, missed out. We only have to look at rural areas to see that one of the problems there is that most of our young unemployed people have left. They have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that most members of Parliament would have had young teenagers in their families. It is very depressing when, for whatever reason, they leave the home. The home becomes empty. It becomes a place where one misses those people. All these small communities throughout Australia are missing their young people as they move towards the coast trying to find work. In many cases they cannot find work in these rural areas, but that is no reason why governments should not spend money in those areas to try to create employment and to try to get people back, if they are going to do it at all. Of course, most of the schemes&mdash;though I am not saying all of them&mdash;were mickey mouse schemes. I am really after the Government to do something about creating real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation we face in Australia is that in June 1992 we have a $150 billion net foreign debt&mdash;an absolutely incredible figure&mdash;with a public debt of $47.9 billion and a private debt of $102.1 billion. The Budget deficit is at $13.4 billion, but we all know that is closer to $20 billion. The sad thing about the Budget, I believe, was the deception of it. It was based on rubbery growth figures. We all knew that it could not be sustained, but some of the commentators did not take any notice of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) did mention that there were going to be some hidden taxes down the line, and that they would work out what they were. Of course, they already knew what they were. A little bit later on these taxes were announced. They were brought forward as a form of damage control. We heard here in the Parliament just recently that the fringe benefits tax was going to be widened and also that there was going to be greater effort by the Taxation Office to raise taxes, because it believed that there was great tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our Fightback package, when we mentioned tax evasion and the black economy, we were told by the Government that it did not exist, yet the Government is going to raise, it says, billions of dollars by getting this black economy money. We have had many attacks on the Fightback package and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has been part of a sustained campaign to attack the Fightback package. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was at a Press Club luncheon and all he did there was attack the Fightback package. He said nothing constructive about how he is going to provide jobs, how he is going to get small business going, how he is going to increase exports, how he is going to save the wheat industry&mdash;there was absolutely nothing constructive about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the main part of the Fightback package that the Prime Minister attacks is the goods and services tax. But who is the greatest advocate of the goods and services tax? I heard the honourable member for Hunter say that there is no way this Federal Government will introduce a goods and services tax. I have got news for the honourable member for Hunter: his leadership is not telling him everything, and he had better get in there and have a yarn to his leaders. There is no way this Government can sustain the economy without a goods and services tax. Already, of course, the Government has a consumption tax: a hidden consumption tax that most Australian people do not know about. If the Government is going to keep this country and provide all the tax cuts that it talks about, it will have a goods and services tax&mdash;I aim this comment at the honourable member for Hunter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to read some of the things that the present Prime Minister has said about a goods and services tax. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government wants to grasp the nettle of tax reform because it is long overdue, it is urgent and it is crucial to the continuing improvement of Australian living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>He says the tax has to be broadly based and, of course, the tax he is talking about is a consumption tax. The Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister most directly responsible for the Government's campaign against inflation and unemployment, let me say that if I believed the proposed switch to a consumption tax would have such dire consequences I would not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA>On another occassion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High tax rates provide disincentive to work, save and invest.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that is only too true. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lower rates are essential to keep the Australian economy healthy, competitive internationally and growing rapidly. There is no more  glaring example of this than our existing tax system. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best way of making these taxes operate effectively and efficiently is with minimum exemptions and with a single rate. That is a lesson which comes from all over the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister goes on and on about the consumption tax that he really wanted to have. But at that time the ACTU, that really runs this Government, was telling the Prime Minister that it did not want any of his consumption tax because it would not be popular. It said, `We will go onto accord mark X'&mdash;I forget which one it was at that time. Certainly we have had a few of those accords and they have not done too much for the welfare of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am a little upset about those people who go around saying the coalition really has the same policies as the Labor Party. I think that is an insult to our intelligence, an insult to everyone's intelligence. As has been said by my friend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), at the first whiff of grapeshot the Prime Minister changed his tune on the tariff debate when he was arguing in the recent by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure our policies are basically the same on tariff reduction. Also, as I have just explained, our policy for a broadly based consumption tax&mdash;a goods and services tax&mdash;is the same. I know the Government is thinking of that. Whatever happens after the next election a goods and services tax will be bought in: one can bet on it. It does not matter what the Government is saying now; there is no way with these rubbery figures that this Government is going to be able to sustain this economy. I am sure that is what it is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hewson) his due, when somebody asked in the party room whether it was a good time for a goods and services tax, he said to us, `When a consumption tax comes in to make a complete change of the system, we have got to be totally honest with the Australian public. We want a mandate to bring this in. We believe we have the right policies for this country'. In comparison, we see the Prime Minister get up here daily and dodge and weave around the place. We hear speeches by the honourable member for Hunter over there, trying to evade this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that whichever party is in government after the next election, it will be bringing in a broadly based goods and services tax. We are up-front with it, we are telling the public what we are doing, but we are bringing in a lot of other concessions. The present Government offers no hope to save, no hope to invest, no hope for those people who have no job, and those people who have a job today are looking around and thinking whether they are the next ones to go. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of my constituent, Mr Ian Findlay, coach of Glen Housman who won a silver medal for Australia in Barcelona recently. In a grievance debate last week I outlined how my constituent was being victimised by one Don Talbot, head coach of Australian swimming, and how new criteria for the awarding of the high performance centre grants had led to him being dumped from that funding program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I faxed a letter to Mr Tom Brazier, President of the board of Australian Swimming, urging him to discuss Findlay's reinstatement to funding assistance at an unscheduled board meeting to be conducted by telephone tonight. This morning I was attacked by the management of Australian Swimming in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> for not knowing what I was talking about. Let me say that I would not be saying the things I have said about Don Talbot and the administration of Australian Swimming if it were simply my personal view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I talked about gun to the head tactics used by Australian Swimming Inc., particularly Talbot and Simon Allatson, the Executive Director, in the way that they dealt with both coaches and swimmers. For Talbot, this approach is nothing new. Let me quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toronto Star</EMPHASIS> entitled `Coach Assails Talbot's Olympic Swim Policy', dated 26 November 1987, when Talbot was in charge of Canadian swimming. In that article, and there are others from around that time, a top Canadian coach called Chris Givens says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my opinion that no one person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>namely, Talbot, head coach of swimming Canada at the time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should ever have total authority and unequivocal power. In this case, the temptation for personal edification has proved too great. Accountability keeps organisations honest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why I have constantly stated that there should be an independent appeal system within the Australian Sports Commission so that situations like this do not have to be aired in public. Givens goes on in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toronto Star</EMPHASIS> to criticise Swimming Canada's schedule of competitions and training camps, which he feels are a hindrance to the athlete's home based training and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exactly what led to the fall-out between Findlay and Talbot, when pressure was placed on Glen Housman to swim in an unsuitable meet prior to the Olympic Games. Givens is quoted as saying the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where, I ask you, are we headed with Talbot's dictatorial regime?. . . I would like to draw your attention to the very threatening letter directed to a few of our athletes who are unable to meet some of the demands imposed on them from the national office. This letter advises some of our elite athletes that unless they comply fully with the whims of the national office, not only would their national funding be revoked but also any grants earned by their successful performance would be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not Con Sciacca talking. This is a top coach, and there were others, speaking out through sheer frustration against the methods of Don Talbot almost five years ago. Where are we now? Obviously there is a sense of deja vu. </PARA>

<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I suspect he was very close to cracking.</PARA>

Athletes first, coaches second, and administrators last. I think Australian Swimming is working from the opposite approach.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have had two separate cases in which our children and our community in general have come under threat. First, some months ago, someone proposed to open a sex shop in Strathfield. This establishment proposed to sell not only hard core pornography but also a variety of so-called sex aids. It would have been in walking distance of a dozen local schools. It was horrifying for our community that the proposal came a few months after Wade Frankum, a user of hard core pornography, mercilessly gunned down our neighbours in Strathfield Plaza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there are three separate proposals to open up pool halls and so-called amusement centres within walking distance of each other in Burwood.

We could have a mini-Kings Cross on our hands in just months. Again, we must act as a community to drive these people out. I am writing directly to the proposed operators and sending them a clear signal that they are not wanted by our community.

If there is one group in Australia which has a particular siege mentality, it is the Queensland National Party.

For instance, there are Kay Elson in the seat of Broadwater, Bob King in the seat of Nicklin, Bruce Davidson in the seat of Noosa and Andrew Schuller in the seat of Currumbin, to name just a few. But I suppose the most incredible transformation we have seen is that of Don Lane. Don Lane was a Liberal Party member who became a National Party Minister and then ended up in Boggo Road gaol for a brief period of time. Don Lane has resurfaced again as the campaign director of Santo Santoro, the Liberal Party candidate for Clayfield. This is an incredible situation, since the Liberal Party used to treat Don Lane with absolute disdain at one stage due to his turncoat actions. But that is not all. Not only does Santoro have Don Lane as his campaign director, his campaign is apparently being funded by the League of Rights. The League of Rights has even been attacked by Senator Ron Boswell as being extremely conservative and negative and contrary to conservative interests in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Honourable members are testing that regularly. As stated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latitude permitted to Ministers has often been quite considerable in the House of Representatives. Speakers have ruled consistently that provided the answer is relevant and it is not couched in unparliamentary language Ministers may virtually answer any questions without notice in any way they choose. The interpretation of `relevant' has at times been very wide and in practice the word has been frequently accepted by the Chair as meaning relevant in some way or relevant in part, rather than directly or completely relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that there have been occasions when the Chair has upheld points of order contesting the relevancy of Ministers' answers, but these occasions have been rare. In 1986 the Procedure Committee of this House recommended changes to the Standing Orders in respect of answers to questions. The recommendation has not been adopted by the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These tax cuts the Leader of the Opposition is referring to are the tax cuts which provide mere compensation for the impact of the GST, which would not need to be there if the GST were not being applied. I know it galls the Leader of the Opposition that the public now understands that to secure a 30 per cent rate of tax on marginal income from the $20,700 level onwards is something which he was proposing, but only with a consumption tax, only with this monster of a tax, a $30 billion tax, a tax amounting to over half the total income tax of Australia. That is, the consumption tax raises over half the total income tax of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a massive impost on taxpayers, on families, on individuals and on women. Women particularly are the people who are going to feel the burden of the GST because they are the ones who generally manage household spending and shopping. They will find a 15 per cent addition to their costs. They will have to argue within their own families about a further transfer of income to themselves to be able to maintain their standard of living, and why? To secure a tax cut which the Government legislated for yesterday and which will be implemented without the need of a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, basically, it is dawning on the Opposition frontbench now that what it has got left are all the nasties in Fightback, all the rotters, all the rotten things, like the GST, like all those taxes on food and clothing and services and the rest. For what? Give it away. They will reduce the price of petrol, which is already cheap by world standards, and then they will impose a $4 billion road charge on registration fees&mdash;$17,000 to $30,000 on a truck and God knows what on each car. There is this enormous tax switch, taking $27 billion off individuals and families and giving $26 billion to somebody else. On top of that, they are supposed to fund the tax cuts but we find that only $1 billion of the $27 billion raised by the goods and services tax will actually fund the tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Leader of the Opposition is now getting very windy about the GST, and so is his frontbench. He is now down to the hard tack. Every time the Cole committee looks like responding to his reference they die of fright because he might end up taxing wheelchairs, artificial arms and all the other things like that. He has been giving a remit to see whether they are zero rated. Of course, these great lions of economic change are up to the barricades, trying to do rational economics properly, as he puts it. What does the Deputy Leader say? `Oh, they are going to have one too'. There is no basis for that; it is unsubstantiated. He is so weak he can only say, in defence of his own terrible proposition which he is so proud of but must then disguise, `They are going to have one too'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, at the first whiff of grapeshot they are in the trenches and on go the tin hats, except they are tin hats with our names on them. The fact is that these people are afraid of their own policies. What that showed, by saying that the Government is going to have a GST, is that Dr Hewson and Mr Reith, the Leader and Deputy Leader, are afraid of their own policies. When the honourable member for Barker says that the Government's policy on tariffs is the same as the Opposition's, he is afraid of his own policies. Not only him; he has had a talk to three or four of his backbenchers over the lunch hour about their views on car tariffs. And in relation to everything else, they are just the same as us. On industrial relations, we have the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Well, there is only an inch of difference between us'. So we have this great brave lion of social change, but once the shots start being fired, what does he say&mdash;`We are just the same as them; they are just the same as us; we are not any different; forget all that stuff about radical change; forget about being different; forget about trying rational economics properly; we are just the same as them'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying before I was interrupted by the honourable member for O'Connor that the result of this agreement would be one union in this plant rather than seven. Such agreements for cooperation would be cancelled automatically under the Opposition's policy of cancelling awards because the agreement has the status of an award. We would find that they would be replaced with contracts which would be enforced only with the slow and expensive procedures of the common law. In practice, we would see seven unions back in there protecting their members' turf. In practical terms that is what would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have one union by an agreement on the base award. The cancellation of Federal awards means the agreement goes with it, and what you get back is basically seven unions all scrabbling over their membership, not to mention the immediate lift of the $12,000 per car tariff on the importation of used cars, which the Opposition favours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker said last week, `I therefore recommend that the coalition oppose the tariff'. When I put that out, he said that I had held it up in Parliament and spread the contents all over the land. He said that, in other words, this country would find that the standard of behaviour would get lower and lower. This is for daring to tell the public that the Opposition actually wished to see imported cars. As the honourable member for Barker said in his own note:</PARA>

That is, the labour market today, notwithstanding the unemployment, is 26 per cent larger than it was in 1983.

There are new land care and environment action programs. Ninety-six thousand young people are being given training and employment opportunities.

If the honourable member looks through the proceedings of the House, he will be aware that honourable members have been permitted to take many points of order in these last few days, and the Chair will always ensure that that right is there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, without in any way wanting to reflect on your own performance, I think it is important that we begin discussion of this matter of public importance by recognising that in the last two weeks we have seen this Parliament's standing reduced to a new low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the total abuse of Question Time by this Government, with a series of dorothy dixers from that side and whatever questions we asked used as the basis for the most amazing misrepresentation and distortion in living memory of the facts that are to be a most important element of the next election campaign. It reinforces again that this Government is absolutely desperate. We have seen it in the way yesterday's tax package&mdash;I should say Budget mark II, four weeks after Budget mark I&mdash;was introduced: cobbled together overnight in about 36 hours, full of mistakes and riddled with inconsistencies. That is one example of the pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of the distortion in this debate about matters of considerable significance to the people of Australia I think pulls this House down to a new low. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has any genuine interest in this country&mdash;quite frankly, on the basis of his behaviour in recent days I doubt whether he any longer has a genuine interest in it&mdash;he will do his part to raise the standard of the Parliament and the contribution it should make to public debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing more disturbing to the average people in Australia, when they are being presented with some genuine and clear-cut alternatives, as they have from our side with the Fightback package, and where a lot of work is being done openly and honestly to address our problems and to provide the sorts of policy solutions that they know are right, than to see a government that has nothing left but a totally negative attack on us and a gross misrepresentation of just about every element of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. This attack probably reached its pinnacle in terms of the Prime Minister's Press Club performance this week, when he devoted the entire speech to a negative attack on us and a personal attack on me and did not once offer any answers to what is the worst recession in 60 years in this country. The Prime Minister has absolutely no answers, as is quite clear. It should not go unnoticed that this is the standard to which he is going to fall in order to get himself back into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally find that disturbing and disappointing, because in the earlier years of the Hawke-Keating Government this Prime Minister, as Treasurer, was making a genuine attempt to deal with the problems. But something has shifted dramatically during the last few years to the extent that he has now forsaken everything he ever believed in or stood for simply for the sake of getting the job first and then keeping the job in the circumstances of the worst recession for 60 years which he himself created and misrepresented to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I thought I would do today is concentrate on two elements of the current policy debate where this distortion should be exposed for what it is. One is the Government's attempt to argue that it can deliver the Opposition's tax cuts without a GST and that therefore it can bring us all the nice things in Fightback without the `nasties', as it has described them in recent days. This is a total distortion and misrepresentation of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, our tax cuts cost, in 1984-85 dollar terms, about $14 billion; the Government's cost $8.4 billion. Secondly, our tax cuts are fully funded; the Government's cuts are not fully funded, and they are not even partially funded on the basis of the information that was introduced into the Parliament yesterday. Overall, if one counts last year through to the middle of this decade, the Government is $50 billion short. It does not matter how the Government tries to dress it up and how far it goes to misrepresent that, the fact is the Government's tax cuts are unfunded. Thirdly, the Government gives no tax cuts to people who earn less than $20,700 per year. That is about 47 per cent of total taxpayers, and over two million of those people are low income earning women who are deliberately and knowingly disadvantaged under its tax cuts policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the way the tax has been structured. The Government has tried to say that one can have a 30 per cent tax rate, in terms of one of the essential elements of our package, but that 30 per cent tax rate only applies over a fairly narrow range. The Government does not lower the bottom tax rate from 20 per cent at all; we lower it to 16 per cent. The Government has 30 per cent from $20,700 to $40,000; we have 30 per cent from $20,700 to $50,000. From over $50,000 to $75,000 we still have only 36c in the dollar tax, which is significantly less than what is currently paid by someone who earns $21,000 a year. The tax-free threshold under the Government's proposals stays at $5,400, whereas under us it is increased to $7,000. This drops about 320,000 Australians from the requirement to pay tax. These are fundamental differences between the Government's tax package and ours, which should be recognised in the essence of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good to argue, as the Government tried to do today, that we are not looking at the total package. When we do look at the total package, it goes even more against the arguments the Government has been putting. Under the Government's total package, a person on $15,000 a year gets nothing. Under our package, that person will get about $12 per week in tax cuts alone, as well as a host of other benefits. A person on $28,000 a year, which is the number the Government has chosen, under the Government's package gets a tax cut of $11 per week. Under our package, that person will get a tax cut of $27 a week and a host of other benefits, such as the doubling of family allowances and access to private health insurance, that are deliberately and knowingly targeted to those people at the bottom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government forgets to mention that if we look at the whole package, so many benefits are provided when we eliminate things such as payroll tax, petrol excise and sales tax, among other things. This will provide not only jobs but also an appropriate cost base for industry in this country, so that we can go on and create wealth and create jobs, which is the only way we will get real and sustainable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that is probably most disturbing to most Australians is that they clearly remember that this Prime Minister in the position of Treasurer strongly advocated a broad-based goods and services tax as an essential part of tax reform. In fact, part of the Government's argument in the last few days in this Parliament has been that we do not need a GST in order to reform tax. I think it is important that we go back and have a look at some of the things the Prime Minister said when he argued this case in 1985. For example, in August 1985 the then Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always believed that an across-the-board broad-based consumption tax was the best tax option for achieving major reform of the Australian taxation system, and moving the weight of direct taxation onto indirect taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a clear-cut statement that it is essential, if we are going to have genuine tax reform in this country, to include a broad-based goods and services tax. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is why I believe that it is essential that the tax reform be pursued through a comprehensive package of measures which reforms both the income tax base and the consumption tax base.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another clear-cut statement that it is essential to have a package approach which includes the goods and services tax. Similarly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the switch in the burden of tax from incomes to consumption is desirable. Why? So that crippling marginal rates can be brought down.</PARA>
<PARA>The only way we will get lasting reform in terms of the reduction of those crippling marginal tax rates is a package that includes the goods and services tax. There has been quite a lot of focus on tax avoidance in recent days. The Prime Minister made this statement on that subject in June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a consumption tax, the fiscal dividend from avoiders and evaders is zero.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howard" NAMEID="ZD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Zero. That is a clear-cut statement that we need a broad-based goods and services tax as part of an overall tax reform package. To see the extent of the hypocrisy of this man, it is very important to look at some of the arguments he used in defence of that position. For example, in June of 1985 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the `too hard' basket for another 20 to 30 years at immense cost to the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the man who has inflicted the worst recession in 60 years on the people of Australia, and he is knowingly opposing a measure today that he once argued, if it were opposed, would be to the immense cost of the vast majority of Australians. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That cost won't be just a loss of net tax benefits offered to the majority of Australians by the Government's preferred approach. It goes beyond that to include the major loss in economic performance that will result from the continued distortion of economic decisions produced by a broken down tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear-cut statement not only that the tax and tax reform are lost, but that it goes to the very heart of our economic performance. On other occasions he pointed out quite clearly that if we are going to make our way in the world and be internationally competitive, that type of tax reform, including a broad-based goods and services tax, is absolutely fundamental. I think it is also important to recall some of the other arguments that the then Treasurer used in defence of that position which go to the very heart of what has been the basic character of his performance in recent days. He said, for example, in June of 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is increasing recognition of the need for a substantial package of reforms as the only way of providing lasting solutions to the serious deficiencies in the tax system. All of us, especially those in positions of influence have, I believe, an important duty to ensure that the debate on taxation remains on a higher plane. We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice, and we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this. It would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest common denominator. The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation. But the question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it is a very important question which I think should ring in his ears long and hard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such long overdue change.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very hard hitting statement made on that occasion by the then Treasurer. There are dozens of such statements putting a very strong case for a mature public debate when we are trying to make genuine change in this country in order to deal with the worst circumstances in 60 years. He went on to say, and I think it is also very important to note this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my view that no government, no political party, would survive a failure to embrace substantial tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly perceptive comment by that man in 1985. I am sure that that will be the outcome of the next Federal election. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see this as a first class chance to do something about the tax system which so many governments have failed to look at for as long as we can remember. Without a decent tax system you can't in the long run keep a dynamic economy and you can't keep a fair country if only some of the people are shouldering the burden. Let me just say to clear up the point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to re-emphasise his position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been basically in favour of this change well before the Treasury was ever given a brief on the matter. In fact, I was talking to people in the party and the trade unions in the middle of last year about this&mdash;well before we ever gave the brief to the Department after the election.</PARA>
<PARA>So in June 1985 he said that it had always been on his agenda because it was so fundamentally important to what had to be done in this country. Of course there was then the classic Keating statement, which goes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the end of this game, you have got to be able to put your head down at night and say, `Well, the things we did today were the right things'.</PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that he has not slept since and that that is why he is looking as drawn as he is. The situation is similar in regard to the tariff debate at the present time. This is the same Prime Minister who, in his earlier role of Treasurer, argued the case for zero tariff protection. He actually argued the case for zero tariff protection with no micro-reform as part of the package. He stood out there and said we should just abolish tariffs. He said that they are an insidious cancer on this country; that they should be abolished; and that we should get them down to zero by the end of the decade. In fact, he publicly chastised the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who he said did not go hard enough and fast enough in the tariff debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, of course, when it suits him and when he thinks he has a marginal seat strategy to run in parts of Victoria and South Australia to frighten people about tariffs, he will knowingly and willingly cost them the opportunity for a larger car industry in Australia&mdash;a car industry that employs more people in Australia and one that offers people cheaper and better quality cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course he attacks me, as he did today, and says that I am inflexible. Too right we are. We will continue to stand up for the interests of the people of Australia. We will give them the car industry they deserve. We will give them the economic climate they deserve. We will give them the opportunities they deserve so they do not have to face the problem, as the situation stands under this Government, of leaving a lower standard of living to their children than they in fact enjoyed themselves. That is the bottom line of this lot: they do not care; they will say or do anything; they will misrepresent anything; and they will undermine anything in order simply to ensure their political survival. If there is one plea addressed to this Parliament, it is that we get back to the issues of jobs and reform in this country which are absolutely fundamental to the concerns of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Spencer Tracy was asked what he looked for in a script, he is alleged to have replied that he looked for the days off. That is what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has been looking for during this last two weeks. He cannot wait for the days off. He has had a terrible two weeks. Under the guise of saying that he wants to get back to an orderly debate&mdash;a debate about the issues&mdash;what has he done? He has spent the better part of his speech doing exactly what he complains we are doing: being personal. He spent the whole of his speech attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is what he was doing. Where were the positive contributions that he had to make in the course of that speech? Of course, there were none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition engaged in what he said was our greatest crime&mdash;that is, distortion. What he did was to go back and try to use, out of context and out of time, some remarks of the Prime Minister about tax policy. The extent of this distortion is clear, because he did not bother to go on and actually say what the Prime Minister did when he brought in his major reform package as far as the taxation system was concerned. Of course, he did decide to abandon a broad-based consumption tax, but he did not decide to abandon the reform of the taxation system. He decided that there were other things which could more generally improve the taxation system and more generally benefit the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never seen a more desperate group of people sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition. They looked miserable&mdash;utterly miserable. What we saw was an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition apparently to justify himself and his leadership. Leadership is back on the agenda because of the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, particularly over the last two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that matters of public importance, like Question Time, are opportunities for the Opposition. Matters of public importance can be brought before the Parliament by the Opposition to raise issues of concern to it. But Question Time is also an opportunity for it to raise matters which it believes are important. How many questions did we have from the Leader of the Opposition this week? Just two. One of them was that absurd question where he got up and said, `Why don't we have an election'. I bet he wishes that he had never asked that question, when he reflects on the answer that he got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen just one attempt to ask a question this week, and that was today. On two other days of the week, the Opposition actually brought Question Time to an early close because it went on to move some matter of censure or some matter to suspend the Standing Orders. The Opposition has been like a fish out of water this week. It has not known where to go or which way to look. The reason for that is that the Opposition Leader has in the last two weeks got what he wanted; that is, some serious scrutiny of policy issues&mdash;only the serious scrutiny was of his policy and, I might say, of him and his style of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He is now complaining because he does not like it when people examine his policies, when his policies are put under the spotlight, and when he is put under scrutiny. That is essentially what he is complaining about today. He says, `Why is everyone being so hard on me? I am just an honest person trying to bring before Australia something which I think is good for it'. But does he really think he is entitled not to have those policies scrutinised? Does he believe that it is not our responsibility to examine in the most minute detail what he is proposing, and what the implications of that will be for the ordinary working men and women of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he expects, of course, is for us just to say `Well, here is this great thing called Fightback which you have delivered, and we should all accept it at face value', to just give it a tick&mdash;and roar on the time when he can be given the opportunity to implement it. It just demonstrates what a rank amateur he is in this business. He swanned into this Parliament a few years ago, took over the leadership of the Party, and believed that he could do what he liked, say what he liked, and simply be given a dream run into government. Well, that is not how democracies work, and it is certainly not the way that democracy works in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition Leader is really complaining about is that, in the course of these last couple of weeks, there have been more and more flaws exposed in Fightback and more and more flaws exposed in his character. I do not want to get into the business of character assassination, but when somebody puts himself up here, particularly in the way in which the Leader of the Opposition did in his speech today&mdash;in a sense, craving sympathy and saying, `Why is everyone so hard on me?&mdash;it is worth while to examine what other people have to say about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reading this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of 29 August about the Leader of the Opposition recently attending a dinner:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the entree, the chairman tapped his glass and asked whether Dr Hewson wanted to say anything to the board. He did. He held up a copy of Fightback and told the business leaders they should have one and should have read it because nothing in it was going to change. End of discussion. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directors were taken aback and the silence was only broken when one said sharply he hoped Dr Hewson had enjoyed his meal, which had only just gone beyond the entree stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman said virtually nothing to Mr Hewson during the remaining courses.</PARA>
<PARA>This is something which more and more people are picking up about this person. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some company bosses, it is the difference between dealing with a professional who understands the real world, and with an amateur politician who draws his policy from text books.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the essential character of the Leader of the Opposition, and that is the essential approach he wants to bring to the government of this country&mdash;total inflexibility, something which he said today he was actually proud of. What does inflexibility mean? Inflexibility is to say, `I have read the textbook, I have the answer, and I don't give a damn what you or anyone else says about it. You take this policy without change and I will accept no criticism of it from within my Party or, indeed, from within the country'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the total antithesis of the democratic process and it is the antithesis of the way in which policy should be developed for the circumstances of Australia. It is the antithesis of the way in which this Government has gone about its task of governing for all Australians over the last 10 years. We have not been doctrinaire, we have not been inflexible; we have been prepared to listen to and to work with people in the community because we happen to believe that we cannot run this country simply by passing laws through this Parliament or by issuing edicts from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is not a command economy. This is not an economy where people should be expected to do as they are told. This is an economy where we expect the participation of intelligent and well-motivated people who have a concern about their nation, who have a concern about what is needed to make this nation great and who also have a concern for the national interest. We believe that the Australian people are intelligent, clever and capable, and the whole of our approach has been to encourage them to become involved in the great process of transformation of this economy away from the lazy Liberal days when those opposite wanted to hide behind tariff walls and bounties and subsidies and work towards a world in which we can hold our heads up high, paying our way in the world, competing with anyone, taking anyone on and winning, and that is the approach we have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approach cannot be controlled from Canberra. It is an approach which cannot be implemented in the dictatorial style which the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe he could engineer in this country. It depends upon the decisions and the actions of managers and working men and women in Australia. It is their actions which determine our success. What we do here in Canberra does not matter that much. What is much more important is how people respond to it and whether they actually embrace the idea of Australia becoming more competitive and more successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He stands here and says, `I am inflexible: you will take Fightback and I will ram it down your neck whether you like it or not, and I will change nothing in it. I will listen to none of your ideas; I will take notice of nothing you have to say about what should be done to improve this country'. That is the difference between his approach and ours, and that is why the people of Australia, I expect, are beginning to have very heavy reservations not just about the content of Fightback but about the very style of government which he threatens to impose upon this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years we have examined the things which have held this country back so as to identify them and to explain them to the Australian people. We have already been through a period of great change, great reform and great improvement. But it has been reform and improvement which people understand and which people are prepared to get behind. We have not tried to dictatorially insist on certain things; we have tried to get people to work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What could be a more important difference in approach than the difference in our approach to industrial relations? In industrial relations under us we have not said that workers are overpaid in the way the Opposition has; we have not said that they should just do as they are told by their bosses. We have said that they have a part to play in improving the circumstances of their particular place of work. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sensible managers in Australia have taken into their confidence and included and involved workers in the changes and improvements in their places of work. It has been a participatory process. It has been a process of getting sensible people together to work out sensible ways in which things can be improved at the level of the factory, at the level of the farm, at the level of the school or the laboratory or any other level. The managers and those who work with them have got together and worked out better, more efficient and more competitive ways of doing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been done in a way which I do not think has been equalled anywhere in the world. If we look at the United States we see that the United States is yet to really face up to the great challenge it has before it. The American economy has become inefficient and uncompetitive. It does not matter how much rhetoric is poured all over these problems in America; unless the real issues are dealt with, America will remain uncompetitive and unable to address the issues in the way we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of models the Leader of the Opposition so wishes to emulate in the world, the United States and Great Britain, are two countries which were either unfair to start with or have become increasingly unfair as a result of the implementation of the policies which he so highly regards. We have not taken that approach because we believe that all Australians have a contribution to make, and we want them to make that contribution in a sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been, I think, a very poor performance on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. In the first place he complains about the diminution or the lowering of the standards of the Parliament on the very day that the Opposition's greatest rabble rouser, its greatest misbehaver in the form of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), has been thrown out again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have employed a concerted campaign of disruption, of challenging the rulings of the Chair, of interrupting members on this side of the House, and then the Leader of the Opposition had the gall to come in and say that it is our responsibility to improve the standard of the Parliament. Then he makes this pathetic plea for him to be extended some sympathy in the context of his policy. As far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned the only thing that needs to be done is for us to scrutinise in exquisite detail what he is saying, what he wants to do and how he wants to do it. That is precisely what we have been doing in the last two weeks, and that is what has hurt him most. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Keating); Jellyback Mark II. What he did during the last two weeks in relation to the wheat market was an absolute scandal for this country. He should be ashamed of himself. We have not seen any leadership, initiative, or compassion from this Prime Minister. All we have seen is a manic display of hatred for everything this country stands for; a manic display of hatred for our past and a manic display of hatred for any single person who says one thing that he does not agree with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has such a manic hatred for Fightback because he knows that it is the only recipe for this country's future. He knows that is the only thing that is going to work. How dare he walk in here and shed crocodile tears for low income earners; how dare he shed crocodile tears for women. His tax package of yesterday does not give the low income earners a red cent, and not a thing for the 60 per cent of women in this country earning less than $20,700. What have we seen from the Treasurer? Again, nothing else. The only thing that man has ever had to struggle for was his university degree. He has been riding home on the pig's back since he was born. How dare he speak about the plight of low income earners in this country. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say that we are inflexible in relation to one thing, and I am proud of that inflexibility. We are inflexible in relation to our passionate commitment to those people who fought and worked for this country. We have a passionate commitment to those people who are struggling to get through the worst recession in 60 years; and we have a passionate commitment to those people whom we want to encourage to get us out of the worst recession in 60 years. If that is inflexibility, then count me in as one of the numbers up the top. That is what the Australian people want. They do not want to see a debacle such as we have had in Question Time over the last two weeks, when the democratic process has been tossed out with absolutely no regard for this Parliament or the people who put us in here. We have seen gross abuse of Question Time. We have seen points of order taken in relation to relevance. And have we had one relevant answer to a question during the week? Not on your sweet Nellie. We should have a standing order not in relation to relevance but in relation to the truth. If we started getting a bit of truth in Question Time, we might see something being delivered to the Australian people, because they most certainly have not had anything delivered to them in the last two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some things the Australian people want, and they are fairly basic sorts of things. They do not particularly aspire to being millionaire pig farmers or part time Prime Ministers. I do not think they particularly aspire to being a Treasurer who is a capitalist wrapped in socialist clothing. I think they have some fairly basic instincts about what they want this Parliament, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer to start respecting&mdash;that is, a job; the ability to put a roof over their family's heads; the ability to have some self-respect; the ability to feed and clothe their children. There are one million people in this country&mdash;7,200-odd in my electorate&mdash;who are battling to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are families that have been forced out of their homes; there are families that cannot afford three square meals a day; there are families that have suffered and continue to suffer because of a Government that has failed to provided any economic leadership&mdash;a Government that has taken this country into recession and has absolutely no idea how to get out of it. The debacle we saw a month ago called the Budget was finished before the Treasurer sat down. They were rushing out of the press gallery to damn it, to condemn it. It was all over before the Treasurer sat down. Then, not more than 30 days later, there is this half-hearted attempt by the Government and the Treasurer to fix up this big hole&mdash;30 days later! This is the Government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has got people spread from one end of the country to the other to assist in doing its job, but 30 days later what does it get? I will tell honourable members what the people of this country will get. They will start getting a bit of honesty in Government again. They will start getting from Prime Minister Hewson&mdash;and, have no doubt, he will be there; and it will be sooner rather than later&mdash;someone who is prepared to call it as it is; not someone who hides in the bunker down at the Lodge; not someone who hides down there and won't get his head out of the bunker. We will see someone who is prepared to call it as it is and invite the Australian people to be part of what is so desperately needed in this country. We will start rewarding a bit of incentive; we will encourage initiative; and we will start giving back to the Australian people that thread of self-respect that has been severed by both the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, and Treasurer Dawkins. They have cut that thread of self-respect in the most callous way. They have kowtowed to the trade union leadership. They have lost the right to represent the working men and women of this country&mdash;that is long gone&mdash;because they do not give a damn about the person at the bottom. `Our people', they call them. They have forgotten about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, no one under $20,700 receives any tax cuts. How about a bit of honesty with the Australian people in relation to the payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise levy? Why has the Government not got the intestinal fortitude to stand up and tell the Australian people that the meat, the green groceries, the milk, the bread and the butter are subject to taxation? When it has the guts to tell the Australian people that, then we will start talking about taxation reform and getting into a proper debate. The Australian people have some fairly basic desires. Those on this side of the House will make sure those desires are satisfied; the other side of the House can never do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About the only thing that can be said about the speech by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is that it was better than the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It has been a bad week for the Leader of the Opposition, a bad fortnight for the Leader of the Opposition, and we had a pathetic matter of public importance speech today which indicates that the pressure is showing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ballarat has said how concerned he is about the families in his electorate who cannot feed and clothe themselves. I suggest that he study that Fightback package very carefully. I also suggest that he look at the analysis that has been done on the Fightback package which shows the impact that it will have on families in his electorate. Seventy per cent of the families in Ballarat and 70 per cent of the families in Fairfax and all of the other electorates are going to be worse off. They will be worse off because those opposite will impose a new 15 per cent tax on bread, milk, telephone bills, water rates and  everything else. It is very clear that 70 per cent of those families that the honourable member for Ballarat is concerned about will be even worse off than they are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition came in here and said that we need a mature and proper debate about Fightback and the Opposition's consumption tax. I give the Leader of the Opposition one suggestion, one piece of advice: hold a press conference in Canberra. He has not been brave enough to hold one since November last year. He is very keen to hold doorstops both here and in other capital cities where the ambulance chaser journalists and others do not have the competence or the training to put the Leader of the Opposition to the test.

Today is the last sitting day for a couple of weeks. Even if he has a bit of a problem at this press conference, no-one will pay too much attention for the next two weeks. He should have some guts and call a press conference today. Let this be the first day that he has held a press conference since November last year. It will be interesting to see when he finally decides to call a full and proper press conference to allow journalists to put questions to him about Fightback and all of the other proposals that the Opposition is putting up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition appears to be very sensitive. He will not countenance any criticism whatsoever of Fightback. It is as if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> booklet were like the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments on them that were handed to Moses. It is as if no-one were allowed to criticise Fightback without retribution from the Leader of the Opposition. Businesses are not allowed to criticise Fightback without being called liars. A member of his own Party is not allowed to criticise Fightback without being declared persona non grata. It is very clear that we have a different sort of Opposition today&mdash;an Opposition that will not listen to the community or to alternative viewpoints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity members in the gallery were not here two days ago when we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) sum up in one sentence the Opposition's whole philosophy today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a conviction in our inflexibility . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Opposition's policy today: `We won't move an inch. It doesn't matter how good your arguments are and it does not matter how ridiculous our consumption tax proposal is, we have a conviction in our inflexibility and we won't budge an inch'. That is the Opposition's policy today, and it will result in the Opposition being routed at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at the alternatives the Opposition has been putting forward for the last few years. What was its view when interest rates started to come down, when the Government started to ease the brakes and when the Government said back in January 1990 that interest rates had been too high for too long? At that time, the Leader of the Opposition was saying, `It's too early to relax interest rates'. The Leader of the Opposition was saying back in 1990, `We shouldn't relax interest rates'. It was the Leader of the Opposition who attacked Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, for allowing interest rates to fall. It was the Leader of the Opposition who was saying, `There's a conspiracy between Bernie Fraser and the Prime Minister', because interest rates were falling. So imagine what unemployment would be like and how deep the recession would be if the Opposition were pulling the levers. The Opposition has a policy of putting up interest rates as often as it can and leaving them high. The reason is that the Opposition knows that its consumption tax proposal will blow prices through the roof and inflation will skyrocket. That is why there will be high interest rates under a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we also remember that it is the Leader of the Opposition who has been running around the country holding these doorstop interviews&mdash;because he will not do a press conference&mdash;trying to create the impression that there should be a currency crisis as interest rates fall. How does that help the nation? How does that help economic recovery, when the Leader of the Opposition is going around saying that the dollar will plummet? How does that help the nation? When the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was running around saying things such as this, we did not care because everyone knew that he knew nothing about economics. However, it is absolutely reprehensible for the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;someone with some understanding of economic issues&mdash;to run around trying to create a currency crisis for the nation, and I am sure the Australian people will judge that at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the parties is that this Government has a strategy. We are trying to give the economy a kick-start; we are trying to boost business confidence. In February this year, the One Nation statement outlined a whole raft of national proposals to improve our rail system and the road network. The Opposition's response was, `That's a terrible thing. We should sit on our hands. We shouldn't have these infrastructure projects creating jobs out there in the community'. What was its response a month ago to the Budget proposals to create jobs in our local councils through the local capital works proposals? The Opposition was totally opposed to any extra government spending to create jobs. The Opposition's view is that we should cut government spending back even further and produce higher unemployment. Higher interest rates, less government spending and higher unemployment are a recipe for putting the economy back into a much deeper recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the Opposition's policy is the same as Max Walsh's opinion in February 1992 when the One Nation statement came out. I am sure you remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as soon as the speech on One Nation was finished Max Walsh said that One Nation was a terrible proposal and that it was terrible to be spending all this extra money creating jobs because the economy was already recovering and the economy was about to overheat. Max Walsh has since changed his mind, but the Opposition is still stuck in February 1992 Max Walsh mode. The Opposition is still saying, `There's too much business activity out there. The Government should sit on its hands. The Government shouldn't be out there trying to give the economy a kick-start'. I am sure the people in the gallery and the Australians who are listening to this know what has to be done. They know that it is right for the Government to be trying to kick-start the economy and boost business confidence. I do not understand why the Opposition has not reconsidered its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is worse than that. If one reads the detail of Fightback, it is a recipe for a national catastrophe for Australia. The Opposition's policy for zero motor vehicle tariffs will wipe out the Australian car industry. At the very time when automotive exports have doubled and reached over $1 billion, at the time we are exporting Ford Capris to the United States and car components to Europe and at the time we are about to export the Magna station wagon to the United States and Japan, the Opposition says that it is time to pull the rug on the Australian motor vehicle industry. The Opposition is saying that Bill Johnston from Toyota is a liar. The Opposition is saying that it does not matter that Mitsubishi might put $600m of investment at its car plant in Adelaide on hold and that Bosch Australia will not invest $50m to create jobs until the Opposition changes its mind. The Opposition is determined to drive the Australian motor vehicle industry and the car component plants right around Australia into the ground. The target the Opposition has is zero  tariffs  and zero  Australian  car  industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Its policy will destroy jobs and the Australian car industry. The Opposition is targeting not just the motor vehicle industry; it is also targeting the price of petrol and the cost of fuel. The Opposition is running around saying, `We're going to give you cheaper petrol and that will compensate you for the higher price of bread, milk, telephone calls and everything else'. But it is only when we read the fine print that we see that the Opposition is proposing a secret road user charge. It will not tell us how much it will be. It tells us that it will have something to do with the mass and distance which the motor vehicle or truck will travel, but it will not tell us how much it will cost. Is registration for a truck going to cost $17,000 a year? How much will it cost us to register a motor vehicle in Australia under the Opposition's proposals? It will cost a fortune and it will certainly ensure that Australia's motorists and truck drivers are worse off. There is a clear choice at the next election. The choice is between an Opposition determined to increase the price of basic commodities of life, determined to wipe out Australia's manufacturing and automotive industries and determined to drive the Australian economy through the floor and the Government, whose alternative is to the give the economy a boost and give the place a kick-start.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not usually speak on expediency motions, but I wish to clarify a number of points raised by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) following the tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Public Works on this work on Tuesday, 15 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the valuation of the building at the completion of refurbishment, it is acknowledged that the current valuation is below the cost of $32.2m which the honourable member mentioned. However, this is true of almost all buildings in the Perth CBD at present. A period of 3 1/2 years is forecast to deliver the project. To this should be added a number of years for tennant uptake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of the building is forecast to increase to $41.5m after 3 1/2 years. This figure was forecast by Richard Ellis in response to a specific query by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Richard Ellis also forecast that 6 1/2 years after refurbishment the building's value would be $54.7m&mdash;I appreciate that these are projections. The brief for the project is to refurbish the building so it can be functional for the next 20 years. It is therefore considered appropriate to refurbish it, notwithstanding that the current valuation is lower than the building costs. I provide these points for the honourable member's information. We have to look not just at the cost at the completion of the work, but at the forward projections as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the scope of the works, it is important to note that it is driven by the essential need to remove asbestos from the building for safety reasons. The building cannot continue to function in the long term without this problem being addressed. Asbestos can be removed only by gutting the building back to its basic structural shell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also expressed concern that only advice from Australian Construction Services was being relied upon. While not conceding that this is necessarily a matter of concern, I should point out that in this project the Reserve Bank has appointed an experienced private consulting practice to project manage the works. The design and construction will also be carried out by private firms of consultants and contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank advised the Committee that the time taken to complete the works is considered to be a responsible estimate of the duration necessary, including allowances which should be made on refurbishment work for minor disruptions. The construction duration has been calculated by the project team consultants and compares favourably with times taken for other similar restoration projects. Also, construction work cannot commence until the Family Law Court moves to new premises early in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultant quantity surveyors engaged by the Reserve Bank have carried out detailed cost estimates over the past six months and consider that the costs per square metre of the Perth Reserve Bank refurbishment are compatible with other refurbishment costs for similar projects. I extend an invitation to the honourable member that any time he is in Perth, or on any other project, he is more than welcome to attend the Committee hearings and briefings on these projects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the report of the Standing Committee on Public Works and the request to proceed, I think the point still needs to be made that the valuer put a value on the building of $14.4m as of April 1992 and we are going to spend $32m on it, which will bring it to a total of $46m. By the Government's own admission, after we have done all of that it will still be worth only $20m. The building is only 19 years old and the scope of works is not extensive. I am concerned that every time we need to justify something we run out the bogey of asbestos related problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we do need to remove asbestos from buildings, this project really only had a minor fire service upgrade&mdash;some electrical fittings to be changed; an extension, as I mentioned, of the fire service; a facade and foyer upgrade; and, of course, the removal of some asbestos. To spend $32m on a building and have it still be worth only $20m is, by anyone's assessment, a blatant waste of money. It also proves that building values in Perth have fallen by half. The building valuer in April 1989 put the building value at just on $28m; today, it is worth only $14m. A prudent person would probably buy a brand new building&mdash;and there are plenty of them in the Perth CBD&mdash;for a darn sight less than the work on this building will cost. The point I am making is that this Government is not property wise, and this is an example&mdash;we are spending a lot of money, $32m, on a building which, when it is finished, will be worth $20m. That makes about as much sense as the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the other week. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like, however, to address my comments to the building program. First, I acknowledge the response by DASET to the recommendations in the report which was brought down by the Committee. As far as I am concerned, as the member representing the people of Christmas Island, it is very encouraging to see the very positive attitude which has been adopted by DASET to the recommendations, and the undertakings that it has given as a result of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) addressing the House this afternoon to advance processes to try to get additional funds to complete road works and additional housing. I think that is very important and it is something which will be appreciated by the island community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to understand the nature of the infrastructure currently on Christmas Island. I think it needs to be appreciated that the existing infrastructure was built to meet the needs of a phosphate mining operation and its workers in a situation which, not to put too fine a point on it, was very colonial and quite repressive, so that the living conditions for many of the workers were well below par. The sorts of activities which have taken place on Christmas Island, until a very active union was formed in the late seventies, are legendary, and the people who worked in the phosphate mine were not given appropriate conditions. That is reflected in the nature of the infrastructure which remains on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in general, it is not built to meet current regulations. Bearing in mind that the law which operated on the island until July of this year was Singapore law, it reflected the colonial administration of the British. So the sorts of standards which we regard as acceptable and appropriate in Australia were not present on the island and are only just being implemented on a gradual basis as a result of the body of Western Australian law applying to the island community. That took place as of 1 July. Those laws will be introduced progressively, but it will mean that any new buildings and other construction activities which take place on the island will come within the ambit of the laws of Western Australia in relation to work health and safety, and building requirements. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be acknowledged that the reason why this building program, announced by the Government as costing $132m over a period of time, is so important is the poor state of the infrastructure stock on the island. As has been acknowledged by the Minister, the work encompasses all types of services, maritime works, foreshore development, new buildings, alterations and additions, upgrading of buildings and demolitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The design allows for a population growth from the present 1,500 people to a maximum of 4,000 residents and visitors. The rebuilding program is a commitment to the future of Christmas Island, but it springs from the past dedication&mdash;and I think this is most important, and you would know that, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a previous Minister responsible for Christmas Island&mdash;of many people to ensure the future of the island. I would like to acknowledge some of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is Gordon Bennett who, sadly, passed away last year and who was the Secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers; Lai Ah Hong, who is the current President of the union, and a very active businessman in the community; Tracey Lim, who worked with the union, and has done so for many years; and Terry White, an administrator who works with what is now the shire council but who was a Commonwealth Government employee previously. He is moving on to a job in Japan, and I wish him well in that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as those I have mentioned, there are all those other people who have been actively involved in the union's activities in particular. There is Seet Choy Lan, of course, who is currently the Union of Christmas Island Workers' liaison officer, and who was previously the General Secretary of the union, and Lillian Oh, who is the current Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also demonstrates the commitment which has been evidenced by what is now the shire council, and what used to be the Union of the Christmas Island Assembly, under its Chairman, Peter Goh. Its members have taken a very impressive interest in ensuring that the needs of their island community have been addressed properly by government. They have made continual representations to a number of Ministers, and I am sure those representations would have been made to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record that the response from the Department has been very good, in my view. The role of the administrators has been very positive&mdash;those people who represent the Commonwealth's interests on the island. I must again acknowledge the very positive and encouraging responses I have had from the number of Ministers I have had dealings with since I became the member for the Northern Territory in 1987, looking after the interests of the people of Christmas Island. I would like to commend all of those people for the very active work they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to appreciate the demographic make-up of the island. A vast proportion of the community are of Chinese origin and many of them have lived on the island for four or five generations. Under the old colonial regime, the wealthy mine owners and the managers lived in very nice colonial houses, but the accommodation for the workers was very shoddy. That is now being addressed and will continue to be addressed as a result of this $132m program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important to understand that the future of the island revolves around a couple of very important issues, both of which could not be profitably advanced without this infrastructure development. One is the continuation of the phosphate mine on Christmas Island. It was closed down as a result of what I think was a very poor decision in 1987, but it is now reopening and should keep functioning for at least another decade. The other is tourism. The best example of that in the present context is the establishment of a casino on Christmas Island to the value of in excess of $40m. That is quite remarkable and the visitors will provide a focus for tourism to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that this infrastructure is fundamental and important to the lives of the people who live on the island. I know the Chairman of the Public Works Committee shares the view that without this infrastructure development it would be totally inappropriate for the Commonwealth to say that it is looking after the interests of the island community. I think we can honestly say that this commitment of funds by the Commonwealth and the way in which it has been advanced by the Government is a demonstration of our bona fides to the Christmas Island community and is an expression of faith by the Government in the future of the community. I thank the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) for his role in making sure the funds were made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some people have not been so positive. I want to place the name of at least one of them on the public record. The CLP senator from the Northern Territory, who, surprisingly, represents&mdash;or is supposed to represent&mdash;the interests of the Christmas Island community, questioned the efficacy of these proposals on the public record on 13 April 1992. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government must justify the cost of this massive outlay . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the great majority of the proposed expenditure&mdash;in fact, $95m of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . invites speculation about the hidden agenda of the Federal Labor Government, particularly Labor Senator Bob Collins and Federal Member Warren Snowdon.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not apologise for having high up on my agenda the proper and appropriate representation of the Christmas Island community in ensuring that it has an adequate and proper standard of living and that it has access to the same level of infrastructure and services that are available to other Australians. If he has a problem with that, he ought not to seek to represent the interests of the island community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put Senator Tambling's mind&mdash;I guess there is a huge assumption in that&mdash;to rest. As I just reaffirmed, the residents of Christmas Island should have, as far as possible, given the obvious disadvantage from which they suffer in living a lot closer to Jakarta than they do to the Australian mainland, the opportunity to enjoy the same standard of living as the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, we normalised the legal regimes on the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands so that the Indian Ocean Territories now both come within the framework of the Western Australian body of law. That is very appropriate. An enormous amount of money and energy has been poured into the development of these plans, particularly the housing policy. This has been an issue of great contention. I know the issue was raised before the Public Works Committee while it was on the island. It is an issue which has been high on the public agenda of the island community, not only in the assembly and the union but in the island community generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that although there was a great deal of debate, and a great deal of frustration which was expressed by the community at various times, the fact that the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) has now released a policy which has been given widespread applause and support within the community speaks volumes for the capacity of this Government to listen to the concerns of the community and make sure they have been addressed properly and adequately. I again put on record my thanks for the way in which the Minister has dealt with that issue. The fact is that we had this senator, who masquerades as representing the interests of the people of the Northern Territory, making these outrageous statements attacking the rebuilding program&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very soon after Senator Tambling made his outrageous statement attacking the building program, he received a letter from Mr Eddie Turner, President of the Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce and yet another island resident committed to the future of the community. I think the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) who is from Western Australia, would know Mr Eddie Turner. In a detailed letter to Senator Tambling, Mr Turner pointed out just how uninformed the senator was about the realities of life on the island, even though he purports to be one of the senators who represent the island's interest. Mr Turner concluded his letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have deliberately gone out of your way to make political capital out of the unfortunate position of Christmas Islanders. We are extremely angry at your insulting remarks and liberal voters will undoubtedly show you their feelings at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure they will. Senator Tambling is not a representative of the residents of Christmas Island; he is a whingeing spoiler, and his attacks on this Government's attempts to lift the standard of living on the island deserve our fullest condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, I want to address another issue which was taken up by the Public Works Committee&mdash;that of training. Very recently, I visited the community and discussed with it a training program which was put in place in the first instance by the Treasurer in his former role as Minister for Employment, Education and Training and, prior to that, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) when he was the Minister responsible. We have put in place a program under the office of labour market adjustment designed to address the very things which have been brought up in the recommendations of the report. I understand it has been satisfactorily addressed by the island community. When we presented our proposals to the community, it was extremely grateful for them. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992 that have been passed in the Senate are acceptable to the Government. The amendments would achieve the following things:  allow for the making of a joint declaration by a builder and the purchaser of a pool; provide that a declaration can be made by a purchaser where the builder has ceased to exist, cannot be located, is refusing to make a declaration or for any other reason is not lodging a declaration; and allow the Commissioner to make decisions in relation to this category of declarations, subject to appeal to the AAT by a builder or a purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will also ensure that the purchaser is entitled to interest for the period he or she did not have use of the money. They will require the payment of an administrative fee to compensate builders for costs incurred preparing a declaration and that will result in a refund being made to a purchaser. The fee will be paid out of the purchaser's interest entitlement. It will be $100 or, if the entitlement is less than $100, the fee will be equal to the interest payment. The amendments will also extend the period available for the making of a declaration for two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was hotly contested by the Opposition in this House. It is, nevertheless, a Bill to expedite the refunds of tax collected in a way which was held by the High Court to be incorrect. This Bill will provide for the refunds to be made. The problem has been to ensure that the refunds actually go to the people who paid the tax in the first place. Some helpful suggestions have been made by the Senate, particularly by those Australian Democrat senators. I quote what Senator McMullan had to say about this process:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the Democrats for taking a constructive approach. The Opposition, by contrast, has been quick to criticise but their only amendment proposal is to simply hand builders a windfall gain at the expense of purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been the problem with the attitude of the Opposition all the way through. It wanted to ensure that these refunds were made to people who had taken this matter to the High Court regardless of whether they were the ones who had actually borne the tax. Where the pool builders had in fact passed on the cost of the tax to the pool owners on whose behalf they constructed the pool, the tax was effectively paid by the pool owner. The Opposition wanted those pool builders to in fact enjoy the windfall gain of receiving those refunds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has not been the Government's objective. The Government has wanted to see that the refunds actually went to those people who bore the tax in the first place. This is a complicated issue because it does require the cooperation of the pool builders in order to determine how much tax was in fact paid and who in fact paid it. I just hope that the pool builders will cooperate with this process to ensure that these refunds can be properly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the amendments requested by the Senate have essentially been put together by the Democrat senators and the Government. They are intended to facilitate the process of getting the refunds to those people who are entitled to them. I hope that this request, and therefore the amendments, will receive the speedy approval of this chamber so that this Bill can be assented to, the provisions within it put into effect and the refunds made as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is correct to say that the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992 was hotly contested by the coalition when it was before the House of Representatives. The reason for the heat in the contest, if that is an accurate description of our approach then, was that the measure as drafted by this Government&mdash;this incompetent Government when it comes to legislation&mdash;would not achieve the principal end to which the Treasurer has just referred. Clearly, those who ultimately paid the sales tax on in situ or in-ground swimming pools were and should be the people who were entitled to and would receive a refund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that the Bill has to be amended in the Senate to achieve that end is testimony to my contention that the Bill would not have done it in the first place. We would not be having these amendments if the Bill would have done what the Treasurer just said, and claimed credit for; that is, making sure that the refunds went to those who bore the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put this matter in a better context. Swimming pools were originally taxed in 1986. Subsequently, in November of 1990, the Australian Taxation Office entered into an agreement&mdash;freely&mdash;with the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia whereby, because of legal advice the association had obtained, the moneys were to be paid into a trust fund on the clear understanding that if the ultimate High Court decision went in favour of the association the funds would be refunded to it. I tabled the letters in the Parliament as evidence of that agreement when I spoke during the second reading debate. The letters are there for all those who may be interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the High Court found that the tax was illegal, and that it was illegal from the date of inception some time back in 1986. Another reason why we hotly contested the legislation when it was previously in this chamber is that the legislation did, and still does, set out to abrogate that agreement which was freely entered into by the Commissioner of Taxation and the association. In other words, it facilitates the Commissioner of Taxation ratting on a legal agreement freely entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the reason that the Government was not prepared to accept our amendment to take that aspect of the legislation out of its ambit and thereby oblige the Commissioner and the Government to honour the obligations set out in that agreement? Senator McMullan had this to say in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the High Court of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has interpreted the agreement in an unacceptable way so we are legislating to overturn it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how this Government goes about ratting on agreements. Nothing more scurrilous could be imagined. In his evidence to that Committee, Mr Winter, the solicitor for the Precision Pools Group, whom I will come to in a moment, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is the product of the most disgracefully dishonest or deceitful conduct by the Australian Taxation Office that I have witnessed in acting for and against government agencies in all my years of practice. I say that the conduct is more disgraceful because the deceitful activities of the Australian Taxation Office have apparently been systematic rather than isolated. They appear to have started in 1990 and they continue today with this Bill, which raises expectations of consumers that they are going to get money back when, in fact, as it will be seen, there will be virtually no money forthcoming from Consolidated Revenue for anyone.</PARA>
<PARA>That might be said to sum it up, but it does not really. The dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee, to which I have just referred, noted, amongst other things, that the Government had adopted the attitude to deliberately move to legislate out of existence a formal agreement between the Swimming Pool and Spa Association and the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;the agreement to which I referred, which was entered into in November 1990. This Committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attitude of the Government in deliberately moving to legislate out of existence a formal agreement, voluntarily entered into by the parties in good faith, will set a dangerous precedent that can only undermine public confidence in future agreements between taxpayers and the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA>I made this very point at length during debate at the second reading and committee stages of the legislation when it was in this chamber before it went to the Senate and before it was considered by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the measure was being debated here, I was able to advise the Committee that there was a decision to be handed down the following day in a case involving the Precision Pools Group. Subsequently that decision became available. It was found by a Federal Court of Australia judge, Mr Justice Spender, that the Australian Taxation Office had indeed acted illegally in that specific case involving the Precision Pools Group. He said, amongst other things, in his judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commissioner were an ordinary citizen, it would, in my view, be unconscionable for him now to decline to do which he promised to do in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the Federal Court; that is on top of the High Court's ruling. Yet this Government insists on legislating in this way to deny the decisions of both the High Court and Mr Justice Spender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we will find many precedents of this sort of behaviour in this Parliament since Federation. It is not a question of whether the transactions which were effected subsequent to the agreement made in 1990 should come under the general provisions for earlier transactions whereby the one who bore the cost of the illegal tax imposed should receive the refund. Of course they should up to the agreement in 1990. But the agreement in 1990 between the ATO and the Association specifically provided that the taxes collected&mdash;illegally, as it turned out&mdash;would be kept in that trust to be refunded to the pool builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be any clearer than that: if those pool builders, if not prima facie but essentially, bore the cost in that way and paid the proceeds into a trust fund, the proceeds should be paid out to those people. Yet this legislation sets out to break that agreement in the most scurrilous and reprehensible way. We in the coalition will not add our name to the action of either the coalition members or the Democrats in the Senate who have acted in the way that they have. They have acted thoroughly reprehensively, in my opinion, and in a way, as I have said, unprecedented in the history since Federation of this Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I will try harder. This debate began on 8 September when in this House we debated the Bill. At that time I made a few points that are pertinent to what we are discussing this afternoon. I made basically three points. The first is that this Bill should have been split into two parts. There are in fact two time spans involved in this consideration, the first being from 1986 to mid-1990, during which time many&mdash;and probably most&mdash;llegal pool builders collected tax from their clients and passed the tax on to the Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second time span involved is from mid-1990 until February 1992, the date of the High Court of Australia decision that said that this whole thing was a heap of rubbish. During that time span, an agreement was made between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia. That agreement has now been found binding in law. Yet here we are in the House of Representatives to pass a Bill to obviate a High Court judgment, a Federal Court of Australia ruling, and the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation to honour his agreement with a member of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look briefly at the very first of those two issues&mdash;that being the time span between 1986 and mid-1990. It is my view that the amendments that have been made to this Bill are purposeful and will yield a positive result. One of the points that I made&mdash;and you may well recall it, Mr Deputy Chairman&mdash;was that many pool builders no longer exist. Because of this recession that the Government side of the chamber does not seem to want to address&mdash;or does not have the capacity to address&mdash;many of those selfsame pool builders who collected tax from their clients and passed that tax on to the Taxation Office are no longer with us as viable operations. The proposed amendments to this Bill help to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that on 9 September the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) rose in his place and, in a brief contribution to the committee debate, said that perhaps the Treasurer ought to listen to the honourable member for La Trobe because perhaps the honourable member for La Trobe had made a few valid points. I do not think the Treasurer did listen. I will tell honourable members what happened: in that committee debate we tried to have this matter sent to a Senate committee so that somebody could work out some sensible arrangements for mechanisms to ensure that pool owners who had paid the tax got the tax back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, as I read the amendments before us today, that these amendments operate properly so that pool owners who no longer have pool builders will be entitled to a refund. Those pool owners who have a pool builder will be entitled to a refund directly from the Taxation Office, thus bypassing the need for the pool builder to be involved now in additional interest and overhead expenses&mdash;a strong point I made to this House on both 8 September and 9 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to my last issue. From mid-1990 until February 1992 there was a legal contractual arrangement between the Taxation Commissioner and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association. The Treasurer has the gall to stand in here and abuse the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) because he thinks the Commissioner of Taxation ought to honour that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable members why there will not be any windfall gain to pool companies. It is because pool builders were in such a tight competitive situation by 1990: many of the non-reputable pool builders were not collecting or paying the tax and many of the pool builders had gone from the scene because of the recession. They sought legal advice. That legal advice said, `You will win if you take this to the High Court. This tax is not a tax'. So they made an agreement with the Commissioner of Taxation&mdash;it was a valid agreement&mdash;which, in effect, said, `We will not collect any more tax from our clients because we can't compete if we do, but we will take part of our earnings and send it to you in escrow and you give it back when the High Court makes its judgment'. The Commissioner said yes. On Friday, the day after we left this House after the committee debate, the Federal Court in Queensland brought down a decision in Precision Pools Pty Ltd and the Queensland Pool and Spa Construction Pty Ltd v the Commissioner of Taxation. One of the things the judge in that case said was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the present case the Commissioner was asserting that there was an obligation to pay sales tax, which obligation was disputed on the other side. In those circumstances, pending the authoritative resolution of the competing contentions, a sensible arrangement seems to me to have been struck: an arrangement to the effect that the Commissioner accepts that if the contention of SPASA is right, the moneys paid to him plus the statutory rate of interest will be refunded, but if the Commissioner's contention is right, the pool manufacturers will have complied with what the Commissioner has insisted all along is their obligation.</PARA>
<PARA>The pool companies were right. The judge further found:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold that the applicants are entitled to judgment in respect of the claims for payment made from 31 August 1990 and interest pursuant to the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments) Act 1983. In my opinion, this entitlement is pursuant to the agreement evidenced by the correspondence between Ernst and Young and the Commissioner in November 1990. In my view, the applicants are also entitled to recover the amounts claimed as money had and received, the circumstances being such that the payments were not made voluntarily but under compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the judge found that the Commissioner has no plausible basis for not honouring the agreement, yet we now have Taxation Office officials and the Treasurer still attempting to defy the legal system in this country. The court has clearly said, firstly, that the tax was not a tax and, secondly, that commercial arrangements entered into between the Commissioner of Taxation and the pool builders were legal and should be upheld. The Commissioner has a moral obligation to uphold that agreement. The Treasurer has a moral obligation to uphold that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that was required was for this Bill to be split into two pieces and for the sensible amendments that had gone through in the Senate to be accepted in order to make viable what we tried to tell the Government in this place back on 8 September and 9 September. We said there would be real problems in trying to administer a flawed Bill which had no effect&mdash;that is, a tax that was not a tax. </PARA>

But I have to say that the Treasurer was stubborn and did not listen. He is still not listening today. </PARA>

The agreement that was entered into in November 1990&mdash;freely entered into by the association and the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;was to avoid the very circumstances which we are now confronting in debate in this House. It was to avoid the possibility of complicated litigation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The almost universal reaction that I have met in my electorate to this Government's most recent Budget has been one of extreme disappointment; most particularly, disappointment at lost opportunities. My electors are disappointed because their interest is in jobs. They are astute enough to recognise that, beneath all of the optimistic projections and rhetoric from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) about the future, there was nothing in the Budget that offers worthwhile job opportunities either now or into the immediate future. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), who is at the table, of what I said: what they are really interested in now are jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to say that individuals were disappointed is nothing compared with the disappointment that was expressed by small business. I think small businesses have been more effectively crushed by this Government than by just about any other previous government. They have been totally ignored in this most recent of the Government's economic forays. It is one of the great mysteries to me how a government could be so short-sighted, in the midst of such a serious recession, as to ignore the fact that small business is the very backbone of Australia's economic activity, particularly in terms of employment activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as small business has had to bear the brunt of the recession, it also has the potential to play a vital role in the recovery process. Instead of tapping that potential, the Government totally ignored it. It was not mentioned in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. If there are some minor budgetary changes mentioned in the detailed Budget Papers, they are so obscure as not to warrant a mention in any of the indexes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general response to the Budget from big business and other significant organisations was also one of disappointment, because the Budget turned its back on responsible economic management by failing to offer policy initiatives that are so essential if Australia is to remedy its major structural problems. There is no mystery as to what those problems are. They are discussed day after day in the media by all of the major commentators. They are discussed in this Parliament by my coalition colleagues, and even occasionally in the corridors by some of the braver Labor members of this Parliament. The Government simply cannot claim ignorance of those structural problems in the face of near universal agreement as to their nature, their severity and the broad policy directions needed for their remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say again, in language that should be understandable to this Government: there is widespread and near universal agreement as to the fundamental problems facing the country. Yet, after 10 successive Budgets, it is widely acknowledged that the Labor Government has failed to address adequately the urgent need for micro-economic reform; overseas indebtedness, which is already at near Third World levels and continues to rise; a deficit prone current account that may well not be able to sustain us through even a modest period of economic recovery; unacceptably high levels of long term unemployment; and capital spending by private business, which is at such a low level and has been over such a sustained period that we suffer the twin dangers of seeing an actual erosion of our infrastructure and of an inability to significantly lower our unemployment through the next economic upswing. There are unsatisfactory levels of personal and public savings and, in the context of such a severe and sustained period of recession, a loss of both consumer and business confidence in the ability of this Government to manage Australia through both the immediate recovery period and subsequent restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I take you back now to my opening remarks about the general public being disappointed with the Budget. That disappointment centred, I believe, on its failure to create worthwhile employment opportunities, and its failure to provide effective relief to the growing numbers of long term unemployed, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a calamity in itself that Australia's unemployment rate has been in excess of 10 per cent for 12 consecutive months, and now seems stuck at close to the 11 per cent level. We all know that the actual figures are far in excess of that. But behind those figures is the human tragedy of over 950,000 unemployed men, women and young people&mdash;the breadwinners, spouses, partners, singles, young people and the not so young. The great majority of them want to work, are searching for a job&mdash;any job&mdash;and cannot find one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's own Budget projections acknowledge that high levels of unemployment will persist into the foreseeable future with perhaps in excess of 900,000 being jobless as far out as 1995. It means that hundreds of thousands of people will face the demoralising effect of long term unemployment&mdash;a destructive loss of human dignity for those people, and a staggering waste of human resources for this nation. It is estimated by the Australian Council of Social Service that the number of long term unemployed now exceeds 340,000 people, and that the rigidity of this recession could take this to 400,000 within two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About half the extra spending announced in the Budget is on job creation and training programs, particularly in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. I have no argument with the great bulk of that assistance going to those States. After all, they are seriously depressed areas. Although they were taken to such a state of collapse by Labor governments, we have a national responsibility to target those areas for special assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what is open to criticism is the apparent lack of long term value in the Budget's job creation and retraining schemes, and the continuing imbalance in the assistance being given to youth and adult unemployed. What is abundantly clear from any consideration of these various employment and assistance outlays is their superficiality and lack of effectiveness in providing full time, permanent employment. The only worthwhile assistance in the longer term for unemployed people is to create real jobs by encouraging effective economic growth. On that count, this Budget is a disappointing failure, to put it at its mildest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Warringah, I have created a Warringah employment task force to try to harness a community effort to bring the attention of the employers in my electorate to the levels&mdash;at the local level&mdash;of long term unemployed, particularly, and unemployed youth. Operating within the assistance schemes which are available at the present time, we are seeing what we can do to generate employment opportunities within the businesses, particularly the small businesses, which are found within Warringah. I am very pleased with the response of employers to that task force work. But what we are essentially saying is that the only real way of assisting the unemployed is not just to retrain them and retrain them. There is no sense in that if, after the retraining, there are no jobs for them to go to. What we are about is providing real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not have to be stressed, but apparently it must be, that a key requirement in achieving international competitiveness will be the skills base in our work force. When we talk of unemployment being a major structural problem in this country, we are really talking of two quite separate but related problems. On the one hand it is obviously a particularly serious problem that we face a period of sustained high level unemployment, but the other side of the coin is of even more concern for a significant proportion of that unemployment represents long term jobless who may fit back into the work force only if they are retrained into appropriate and needed skills and if the jobs are there when they are retrained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister deserves the criticism levelled at him for the economic mismanagement that has created the tragic boom and bust of the 1980s and almost one million jobless, he deserves outright censure for his failure to provide worthwhile retraining for the more than 300,000 Australians who may well be unemployable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned my concern that the small business community, which I believe is the economic dynamo of this country, was ignored in the Budget, not warranting even a word of encouragement. This Labor Government has forgotten that there are over 700,000 small businesses in Australia which provide two million jobs, or about 48 per cent of private sector employment. Stack that up against the treatment small businesses receive from this Government. The small business community's requests for meaningful taxation reforms have been ignored, as has their very reasonable request for urgent attention to simplified business regulations. Instead it has been subjected to increasing costs, such as the superannuation guarantee levy, at the very time when bankruptcies have escalated from&mdash;and this figure should be noted&mdash;16,507 in 1989-90 to 27,166 in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of all that, the Prime Minister snubbed small business in his July 1992 unemployment summit in much the same way that the Treasurer has snubbed it in this Budget. My work with the Warringah employment task force has convinced me that in turning its back on small business the Government really has missed a key opportunity to kick-start the process of economic recovery. It bears reflection that a modest stimulation or concession to small business that might cause all 700,000 organisations to put on just one additional employee would wipe out Australia's unemployment problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the subject of the remaining structural problems facing the country&mdash;micro-economic reform, foreign debt, the current account, business investment and savings. As I have already mentioned, responsible commentators and analysts give almost daily comment on one or more aspects of these matters. In view of that exposure and the wide acceptance that they pose a legitimate concern for the long term well-being of the country, it is astonishing to read the Reserve Bank's recently released annual report. Its introductory chapter is entitled `The Focus of Policy'. I would have expected a thorough and thoughtful analysis of current economic policy, with particular reference to the bank's charter in relation to full employment and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. Instead of such an analysis the bank seems mesmerised with one single factor: low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introductory chapter runs to about 5 1/2 pages, and the first three are almost totally concerned with the achievement and advantages of low inflation. It is almost as though low inflation is some omnipotent policy objective towards which the Reserve Bank and the Government have been directing all their resources, and having achieved that goal they now believe the major battle has been fought and that both recovery and sustainable growth are just matters of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider a quotation from the Reserve Bank's report. Having talked for three pages about the virtues of low inflation, it admits that the slow pace of recovery reflects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ongoing adjustments made necessary by the excesses of the 1980's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . other structural changes have been occurring throughout the economy as businesses have adjusted their work and management practices in an effort to become more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is it. There is no discussion of the ongoing adjustments made necessary by past excesses and no discussion of the adjustments by business to remain competitive. I think it is talking about micro-economic reforms, but having mentioned the word `adjustment' the bank considers that that alone is sufficient attention to this subject and goes straight to this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The positive side of these adjustments is that important fundamentals for the Australian economy are moving in a favourable direction.</PARA>
<PARA>What fundamentals? The bank makes the quite incredible disclosure that business profitability is relatively good, that lower interest rates have reduced debt burdens, that the financial system is well capitalised and, once again, we have low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After such a probing analysis of just what are the important fundamentals in our economy and their favourable direction, the bank takes another gigantic leap forward and concludes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, although overlaid with some immediate difficulties the Australian economy now is structurally very much stronger than it was when Australia was emerging from the recession of the early 1980's.</PARA>
<PARA>I imagine the Reserve Bank is asking us to accept that micro-economic reforms, foreign indebtedness, our balance of payments and private capital spending levels can be described as `some immediate difficulties', and that each of those structural problems is of lesser significance today than it was a decade ago. It is obviously blatant nonsense, and an insult to an organisation that has as its charter a concern for full employment and the prosperity and welfare of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the bank's report, I think one must be forgiven for believing that it is just another arm of government, praising past achievements, sliding over difficulties and pointing with optimistic caution to the future. In saying this I do not deny for a moment that low inflation is a worthwhile achievement. It is, and its maintenance offers enormous advantages for Australia's competitiveness. What I object to is the implication in the bank's report that low inflation has been a, or even the, targeted goal of past economic strategies. The truth is that it was an unexpected result from a recession that got away from the Government and took this economy into its worst situation in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, inflation might well stay low while we work our way through this painful period of depressed economic activity. The more important question is whether this Government will be able to sustain low inflation once the recovery process is well advanced. The OECD for one has some doubts, but I will say more a little later about its observations on the management of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that Australia has had to pay too high a price for low inflation. The share market crash, the property crash, the employment crash and the confidence crash have all made a contribution to low inflation but at the unacceptable price of about 100,000 jobless for each percentage point of inflation, and an economy that is staggering along the bottom of an economic trough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If given the option, I do not believe there is any doubt that this Government and the Reserve Bank would have preferred half the level of unemployment in return for perhaps two or three additional percentage points of inflation. But this is not the case, and instead we see Australia's central bank trying to justify the only worthwhile benefit to come from this tragic recession as though it was part of some grand strategy that has succeeded in setting the stage for sustainable economic recovery. Clearly the bank does not believe this. Its actions indicate some concern for greater responsibility than that suggested in its report, and I can only assume that the present political climate demands a diplomatic show of support for its political masters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this alters in any way the reality facing Australia&mdash;that bad policies, sustained for far too long, have not only caused the most serious economic and social disruption in over 50 years but also still leave us with the task of addressing those structural problems that stand in the way of sustainable long term recovery. If I had to prioritise those problems I would suggest that the related areas of business investment and productivity are the key to our long term prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality we face is that new private capital spending has dropped by 30 per cent in real terms in the past three years. Despite some optimistic projections in the Budget, there is still no evidence that this free fall has been arrested or that we may have entered a recovery phase. The significance of this devastation in business investment does not appear to have been appreciated by the present Labor Government for it was sidelined in the Budget almost to the point of being ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Government justify such an attitude when the Economic Planning Advisory Council estimated a year ago that sustaining an economic growth rate of 3 per cent would require total fixed investment of around 25 per cent of gross domestic product? The latest statistics available to me show that ratio to be below 20 per cent, and that has been below EPAC's 25 per cent target for all but five quarters in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, Australia is not investing at a sufficient rate to employ both its growing work force and its unemployed. What this means is that without major attention to, and a substantial reversal in, present business investment trends we face the prospect of continuing high levels of unemployment and slow economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgent need in this Budget was to take constructive steps towards restoring business confidence and the investment climate. We needed a clear signal to the business community that the Government believed that the health of the private sector remained essential to the strength of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a disguised plea for a return to handouts or protectionism. It is simply an observation that this Budget lost the opportunity to improve business confidence. This could have been achieved so simply&mdash;an acknowledgment that the Government would give greater attention to structural and micro-economic reforms, and perhaps some meaningful changes to the host of regulatory requirements that make investment projects such a discouraging process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, for far too long this country has borrowed too much, invested unwisely, been too slow in adopting new technologies and new ways to work, and we have paid ourselves too much in relation to our productivity. As the influential Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests in its 1991-92 report on Australia, it has doubts about the Government's ambitious projections for the coming year; it criticises the slow pace of reform in the labour market, our poor productivity performance and the Government's handling of monetary policy; it casts doubt on the Government's ability to hold the gains offered by low inflation; and it indicates that the Reserve Bank of Australia should have a greater degree of independence from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it is the OECD, CEDA or a host of other respected analysts, the identification of and response to our essential structural problems are spelt out over and over again. What has happened? They are so effectively ignored in the tenth Labor Budget that it is more than just a reflection of a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who have subordinated economic management to their political agenda&mdash;it reflects a political party that does not have the will nor the philosophical strength to carry through these politically sensitive reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Budget of 1992-93 and we are concerned with the appropriations that are made at this time to ensure that the Government's commitments, as outlined in the Budget documents, can be met. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) has raised one or two issues which are worthy of response. The first issue relates to the present economic conditions. Twelve months ago when one sat down with someone from the business community of Australia and said, `What would you like to see in the Australian economy to enable your business to develop further?', invariably the answer was&mdash;when I spoke to them at least&mdash;`Sustainable low inflation'. We now have an inflation rate of about 1.2 per cent and an underlying inflation rate of just under 3 per cent&mdash;one of the lowest in the OECD. Yet we are now hearing from business, or at least those people who purport to speak for some businesses in the community, `Yes, that is fine, but it's really not enough; we needed some further incentives in the Budget, something to stimulate our interest and stimulate business confidence'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing one would have to ask is: what is likely to affect the investment potential for business? What is going to stimulate business to invest in plant and equipment and in the Australian economy and thus create jobs? I guess the answer would be, `I suppose it is the cost of borrowing money, that is, interest rates'. What is the prevailing interest rate regime at the moment? As far as Australia is concerned it is at a 30-year low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have sustainable inflation at 1.2 per cent, the overnight bill rate at about 7 per cent at the moment and we have a dollar value which is reasonable in anyone's terms. So the macro conditions are supposedly right for business to grapple with; therefore confidence should return. But it seems that that is not happening, or at least not according to some commentators. I guess we have to look a bit further and ask, `What else is required?'. When we talk to some people, they say, `We need to have something of a begging bowl mentality; we need to have rationalisation of fees and charges; or we need to have some other taxation changes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is to forget all of the work that this Government has done by way of micro-economic reform. In the taxation area, which is a classic example of micro-economic reform, there has been a massive change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debates of this type it is very easy for honourable members on both sides to say, `We need more', just as it is easy to say that the Government has put considerable resources into retraining and into kick-starting the economy by putting forward a major capital works program. Those criticisms are unjustified for a number of reasons. Firstly, retraining people and putting them in real jobs is a very important dimension of what this Government has aimed at, not only in this Budget but in all the others before it, in mini-Budgets, May statements and a number of other programs that have been announced from time to time during the last eight years. It is interesting that people stand up in here and say, `Retraining is no good because we want real jobs'. But that is where it stops; no-one then says what those real jobs are or in what industries they are located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compare the situation in the electorate of the honourable member for Warringah, on the North Shore in Sydney, with that in my electorate on the south coast of New South Wales, the industrial city of Wollongong. The major industrial base in my electorate is heavy industry in the steelworks. In 1983 BHP employed directly 23,000 people. At the moment it employs approximately 7,800, and it is about to offer further voluntary retrenchments to people to get its work force down to 6,000. As I have remarked during debates in this House before, that has had a devastating effect on the local economy. It has had a devastating effect because, firstly, many of those people who took voluntary redundancies during the reduction of that direct employment established themselves in small businesses. They really had no training in how to operate a small business and so they failed. It was not the fault of government or anyone else. It was simply the fault of those people who took voluntary retrenchment, took the golden handshake, took the money, and said, `I can become a small businessman'. They went out and invested in something, and failed because they had no training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retraining and reskilling in those situations is very important, just as it is important in the broader concept of how Australia is changing. We are becoming a more sophisticated and highly technical society. The days of the dead-end jobs, as the Prime Minister indicated some weeks ago, are long gone. In Australia these days we do not find people employed in offices as office boys or office girls, or people who make the tea and so on. Those jobs just do not exist. These days the basic requirement for many people being employed is computer skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training is an important component of what this Budget is all about. Once the jobs in the steel and related industries in the Illawarra region disappear there is, nevertheless, still a pool of skilled employees. The question is: where do they go? How do we attract other industries to the region to soak up that unemployed base? That raises the whole range of micro-economic reforms referred to by the honourable member for Warringah. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been major changes on the waterfront. People say that nothing has happened on the waterfront in respect of micro-economic reform, yet there has been a 47 per cent reduction in manpower. Turnaround times are almost world best practice, and in some ports they are world best practice. Yet people constantly throw up that subject because it was mentioned at some stage in the past as needing addressing. Earlier this year the One Nation statement tried to address some of the other intrinsic and basic issues such as infrastructure improvements&mdash;road and rail systems&mdash;so that freight could move around this country. If that is not a micro-economic reform, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two ways in which governments can properly operate, and this Budget covers both avenues. Firstly, they must build on the micro-economic changes that exist in the economy; and, secondly, they must look at the macro-economic consequences that flow from that. I have mentioned the macro-consequences&mdash;inflation under control and interest rates at a 30-year low&mdash;they are out there for business to grab hold of and create real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a micro-economic sense, the Government can help stimulate the economy, as it has chosen to do in this Budget, by putting money into capital works programs. Lest people forget, and think that this is the only level of government where this has happened, I remind them&mdash;and I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from New South Wales, would be well aware of this&mdash;that the New South Wales Budget, delivered earlier this week, followed exactly the same strategy, in that money was set aside, largely for capital works programs, to put people in jobs now. That is exactly what this Government has sought to do. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the local capital works program we have seen a very large injection of funds directed at that level of the community where it can do the most good&mdash;the local government area. Importantly, the funds are coming from the Commonwealth to the local government areas for them to administer and put in place job creation programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow, the Lord Mayor of the city of Wollongong, Alderman David Campbell, and I will have great pleasure in announcing the first approval of projects in Wollongong under the local capital works program that was announced in the Budget. Under this very important program, $7.5m was made available to Wollongong for a number of these projects which will be announced tomorrow. Wollongong City Council was the first to get its list of projects in for approval, and that is why they are being announced tomorrow. It was part of a broader $12m package of funds directed to the Illawarra region in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some criticism from certain sections in the Illawarra when these moneys were made available. Largely, people wanted more. It was a question of putting the hand out and saying, `It's not enough'. On the basis that certain criteria had to be met, and considering that the unemployment rate in the Illawarra generally is about 14.8 per cent&mdash;although, naturally, one finds higher and lower pockets throughout the area&mdash;it is appropriate that moneys be directed to the region, and that is exactly what has happened here.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget not only directed moneys through that local government program to assist in building cycleways and training people in a range of other activities associated with these local job creation programs; it also made available money to the tune of $5.8m to the University of Wollongong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That money is to go towards some very important projects. As was indicated at the time, a $2m allocation for a multi-media and open learning facility is to be constructed at the university commencing in 1993. The university will provide matching funds, so that the total cost of that project on campus at what is fast developing as Australia's leading university, will be a total of $4m.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Interestingly, that program will directly create 40 jobs and an additional 60 indirect jobs. The university will also benefit from $3.864m for capital works provided through the annual operating grant and the university's planning arrangements. That will result in an additional ability to stimulate the construction industry in the Illawarra, more jobs being created and, with a multiplier effect, a local boost for the entire economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when one adds to that a further $12.25m that has come from labour market programs for the Illawarra in this Budget, our region has done pretty well out of this Budget. It has been suggested by some that the Federal Government does not know where the Illawarra is. I totally refute that. When one looks at the allocation of funds that has come from this Budget, it certainly puts a lie to those sorts of claims. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $12.25m will go to a whole range of local programs. It will go towards providing assistance to employers to take people on. It will go towards a range of job skill programs, and so on, which are desperately needed. We will see a continuance of funding for a number of Skillshare projects which exist throughout the city and the region. All of these projects are geared towards training people for real jobs which can ultimately be created. They are being very carefully targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to tap into that confidence factor that the honourable member for Warringah mentioned. We must ensure that, through the interest rate regime and the inflation rate regime that are operative, and the stimulatory measures that the Government has particularly targeted at disadvantaged regions such as the Illawarra, we do find that things improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest people think that the present difficulties in Australia are confined simply to us, I implore them to look more widely around the globe. The honourable member for Warringah also quoted a number of OECD publications and talked at length about some of the projections that were made. I can relate a little story to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Earlier this year, representing the Government, I attended the United Nations Conference and had the opportunity to talk to senior officials from the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I told them what the inflation rate was in this country, they said, `We did not know this'. When I told them about the reforms in the labour market area, they said, `We did not know this'. I said, `I know you didn't know this because you've just released your 1991-92 report on Australia and you've made some criticisms about what has happened'. Therefore, I do not think those criticisms were fair, and I said as much. They undertook in their new survey to have a closer look at what is happening here. I think that is a very important point. There have been major changes in Australia that, perhaps in some people's eyes, have not been as significant as they are, and I think we need to highlight that from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had the opportunity recently, in my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to visit a number of overseas countries&mdash;OECD countries, I might say, at that&mdash;to compare and contrast economic conditions. Every one of those economies are wrestling with exactly the same problems, and have been ever since we have since this recession started. They have been wrestling with the same levels of unemployment. They have been wrestling with the calls for very low inflation rates. Their treasuries have been giving advice and saying, `This is really what it's all about'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have also seen interest rate reductions, although, of course, not all of them. Last week Sweden&mdash;and heaven help us if we do the same thing&mdash;increased in one fell swoop its interest rates for mortgages and so on, from 16 per cent to 24 per cent. But that was just the good side. On that same day, for its overnight cash rates, it raised its interest rates to 75 per cent. It would be a bit of a worry for a businessman in Sweden, would it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to look a little further afield than Australia and understand that a lot of the difficulties that we are experiencing are just the same as those being experienced elsewhere. When one looks at the trade relationship between us and many of these other countries such as Japan, the United States, the Asian economies and Europe, who are our major trading partners, one sees problems there and they have contributed to the malaise that we have in the Australian economy. But this Government, through this Budget, has taken appropriate steps to address the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;and I know this again will interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because you too are a member of this particular group&mdash;one of the aspects of the Budget which always interests me from time to time is the amount of money which we spend on the ABC and the amount of money that is directed towards it. This money is directed towards the ABC for particular programs and it enables that government funded service to provide much needed programming and services throughout Australia. I was shocked and horrified at the decision by the board of the ABC that, as of next year, it will no longer televise nationally rugby league, which it has done throughout Australia for the last 20 years. The argument being advanced, that it is simply a two-State code of football, is absolute nonsense, and I do not know who was advising the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rugby league is played in every State and Territory of this country. We are trying to get a team from Western Australia into the Winfield Cup. There are moves afoot also&mdash;and we have seen the New South Wales and Australian Rugby League in the last two years play to absolute packed houses&mdash;to have test matches and State of Origins in Victoria. We have also seen club football matches play to packed houses in South Australia and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the secretary of the all-party parliamentary rugby league group and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are also a member of that august body. I am sure you feel most aggrieved that the ABC has decided it will no longer televise this sport to all of Australia. I have lent my support to a letter&mdash;of yesterday's date&mdash;which the chairman of our group has sent to the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr David Hill, calling for the matter to be reviewed. Of course, Mr Hill has an interest in rugby league and I hope he does everything in his power to influence the board to change that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We give funding to the ABC so that sport, arts, culture and so on can be made available to everyone in this country. After 20 years of broadcasting rugby league to the outback areas of Australia&mdash;to those parts of this country where people thrive on this sport&mdash;I think it is absolutely outrageous to take this decision. I qualify my comments by indicating that I am a director of the Illawarra Steelers Rugby League Football Club and, therefore, some might claim I am biased in this matter. But, as an avid supporter of the code in any case, I think that decision should be reversed. However, on the whole, this is an outstanding Budget which is in line with others delivered by successive Treasurers in this place. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with much of what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), has said&mdash;particularly his latter remarks about rugby league&mdash;but I am afraid I cannot agree with his final glowing comments about the effect of this Budget. In fact, Labor's final Budget, which we are debating this evening, cannot be called a real Budget at all. It is in fact Labor's third mad spending spree in less than a year. It is a monument to the fiscal incompetence of the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major feature of this Budget is its $13.4 billion deficit. Few people really believe the Budget deficit will be only $13.4 billion. After all, last year the Labor Government was $4.6 billion out in its estimate: the deficit was $4.6 billion worse than it had predicted. In the previous year, it was out by $6.2 billion. How many billion will it be out even with this appalling projected figure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Achieving $13.4 billion will be critically dependent on a significant range of asset sales. No Labor government has ever before achieved its asset sales target. Unfortunately, these asset sales will not be used to retire debt, in spite of the fact that our country now has a disgraceful international debt figure of around $160 billion or more. The Government will sell Qantas and Australian Airlines to pay unemployment benefits in order to balance this year's Budget expenditure and spending spree. It will be selling off the family silver to patch the leaky roof. We will not be getting any long term lasting benefits as a result of these asset sales; we will be merely paying today's bills. That is the sad and sorry state to which our country has degenerated financially in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every Australian needs to be aware of the legacy of debt that this Budget will leave behind for future generations. It is the biggest deficit in our national history. In effect, a $13.4 billion deficit means that, as a country, we will be running at a loss of $1.5m for every hour of the year. Every Australian worker will, in the future, have to pay at least $2,000 in extra taxes just to pick up the bill for this year's deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deficit is bigger than the entire Federal Budget during the height of the big spending Whitlam era. This year's Budget deficit is greater than the accumulated deficits of the first 75 years of Commonwealth government. The Budget deficit would build 12 new Parliament Houses. The deficit amounts to an average bill of $835 for every man, woman and child in Australia which will have to be paid some time in the future. The deficit is equivalent to seven entire Australian wheat crops, five wool clips, or 20 years of sugar production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To eliminate the Budget deficit, the Government could have trebled fuel taxes, increased personal income tax by a third, or increased sales tax by 150 per cent. Alternatively, it could have halved all pensions and welfare benefits, abolished all health expenditure, or abolished all payments to the States and local government. These horrific statistics demonstrate the enormity of our country's economic strife and illustrate the legacy of debt that the Federal Labor Government is passing on to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who will be a part of the next Government of Australia, I am also concerned that that is a legacy of debt with which the incoming coalition government will have to deal. We will be left with a $13.4 billion deficit from this Budget&mdash;and probably a good deal more than that&mdash;before we even start to look at the kind of reform program we need to put in place. This is indeed an irresponsible financial mess which is being handed on to future generations. This Budget lacks any sort of fiscal responsibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when our current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer he boasted about how important it was to have balanced Budgets. He boasted about his own financial surpluses on one or two occasions. But now that he is Prime Minister it seems that he is going down the same old path that was followed by Cain, Wran, Burke, Bannon, Kirner and so many other heroes of the Labor cause. We are following a spending path to economic ruin. As a country, we cannot continue to have Budgets of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) admitted in this Budget that he will be providing a range of new tax measures. In the Budget he actually referred to the need to boost revenue so that he could deliver tax cuts at some stage in the future. But there are tax increases even in this Budget document&mdash;the new car park tax, another attempt at taxing swimming pools, and talk about taking into account in means tests the interest and unrealised share gains of pensioners and the like. The fact is that we will need at least $20 billion in additional revenue to fund the expenditure programs contained in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, there is still a secret tax agenda, in spite of the mini-Budget that was introduced yesterday. Only 30 days after the Budget was brought into this House and while we are still debating it, the first mini-Budget arrives on the scene. Despite three weeks of denial that there was any kind of secret tax agenda, the Government produces the legislation to introduce a new range of taxes&mdash;$4 billion worth of new tax revenue to be raised even before the ink on this Budget is dry. There is a draconian new fringe benefits regime and a whole stack of extra paperwork for small businesses in an attempt to beat out of them money they clearly do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This extra $4 billion still leaves the Government with a gaping $4 billion hole in funding its proposed new tax cuts&mdash;tax cuts which of course provide nothing to the poor or to anyone with a taxable income under $20,000. They are merely attempts to match some of the tax cuts which we will be providing through Fightback and for which we do not need to introduce these kinds of draconian measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP fiscal policy has clearly degenerated to a Bankcard philosophy: `The Budget you have when you don't really have any commonsense or any proposals in mind to fund what you are proposing to spend&mdash;buy now, pay later'. It is the Budget a government introduces when it knows it will not have to pick up the bill; when it knows it will not be in office when the consequences of its financial spending spree are felt by ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget and the proposals introduced into this House earlier this week are not the end of Labor's secret tax agenda. It is already speculating about a range of other proposals. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Department of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), is talking about a new tax on private home owners to help subsidise rental for renters. About two weeks ago there was talk in a newspaper of a proposed new tax on food and clothing to help pay for environmental damage allegedly caused by farmers. Of course, other ALP members are still proposing death duties, a super-Medicare levy, a range of wealth taxes and other measures to add to the burden being met by hard-suffering Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public has a right to know what options the ALP is still considering to make up for the enormous deficit that it is delivering to the Australian people in this Budget; the enormous additional taxes it will have to raise in the future to cover the expenditure that is not funded in this particular proposal. Let us bear in mind that this is, in spite of the enormous deficit, the biggest taxing Budget in our national history. In nine years, Labor has more than doubled personal income tax; it has trebled company tax; it has trebled the wholesale sales tax; it has multiplied fuel tax seven times over; it has introduced dozens of new taxes; and it has introduced taxes that did not exist previously which now raise billions of dollars. This is the kind of regime it has delivered in the past, yet clearly it has still been unable to fund this sort of Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very high price will be paid by future Australian generations for the fiscal irresponsibility that is delivered in this Budget. When we look at the appalling performances of Cain, Wran, Burke, Bannon and Kirner and others who have delivered destruction to their States, it is quite obvious that the Keating Government and this Treasurer are taking Australia down the same path to economic ruin. Let us not forget also that the Goss Labor Government in Queensland is behaving in a mirror image of those who have delivered such wreckage to other States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday, Queenslanders will have the opportunity to deliver early judgment of the Goss Government. Let us remember that the Goss Government is delivering the same sort of taxation policies, despite its promises of no new taxes, that we have seen in other Labor States around Australia. In just three years in government, the Goss Government has almost trebled land tax, doubled taxation on gambling, almost trebled collections from licensing and permits and increased payroll tax significantly. Does that not make Labor's current promises to implement payroll tax concessions so empty? It has increased payroll tax during its term in government, so its promises to make reductions in the future are clearly empty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Labor governments in other States, it is already robbing the reserves of statutory authorities to try to prop up its own spending spree. In spite of the difficult economic circumstances in Queensland, each Labor Budget has delivered major new spending expansions of 7 per cent or more. Despite its election promise of no new taxes, taxes have indeed risen enormously under the Goss Labor Government. There have been thousands of significant increases in taxes. We are now coming to a new election where Labor has actually ditched its `no new taxes' promise. On the first day of the election campaign the Goss Labor Government announced a 150 per cent increase in taxes on tobacco, and, despite repeated questioning by journalists and others, the Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, and the Premier, Mr Goss, have refused to repeat Labor's 1989 election promise that there would be no new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that if Labor were to be returned in Queensland there would be a wide range of new taxes. There will be not just the new tobacco tax but a new fuel tax. Indeed, the Road Transport Commission, with the help of the Federal Labor Government, is obviously smoothing the way towards the introduction of a fuel tax in Queensland. There will be a financial institutions duty. The once proud boast of Queensland as the low tax State will be lost. Queensland, once the glamour State in Australia, has an economy which has already stalled. The ALP disease is already spreading to Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No new tourism or development projects have been announced since the election of the Goss Government. The only cranes operating in Brisbane at the present time are those on government projects. Even in the mausoleum of Victoria some building activity is going on. That is not happening in Queensland. The Goss Government has already brought that to a halt. It has stopped so many exciting projects: the China steel deal has been lost; the Gladstone alumina refinery has been stalled for at least three years and maybe permanently; and the Cape York space base seems to have been lost. This is the sort of government that Labor delivered in southern States and is now delivering also in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goss Government was elected on a promise of `jobs, jobs, jobs'. When it was elected in Queensland we had an unemployment level of 97,000. That was an unacceptable rate. But in spite of the Goss Government's election promise of `jobs, jobs, jobs', in two years it has delivered an unemployment number of 165,000. Unemployment has almost doubled under this Government which claims to be concerned about jobs. It is interested in jobs all right, but only jobs for the boys, jobs for its union mates, jobs for their party hacks and jobs for the failed bureaucrats in the southern States who flocked to Queensland to find a place in our burgeoning Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Communist Party<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Vanguard</EMPHASIS> newspaper records in its latest edition that the number of public servants in Queensland has grown by 16,400 during the time that we have had the Goss Government&mdash;the only growth industry in the whole of the State. Indeed, the public sector has grown significantly since the election of the Goss Government, stacked up with failed bureaucrats from the southern States. Do honourable members know who Wayne Goss appointed as his financial adviser? It was John Bannon's failed financial adviser. The man who delivered the State Bank of South Australia fiasco has now been appointed to the staff of Wayne Goss to deliver similar disasters to our State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in South Australia recently people were talking about a new $2 a day tax on every South Australian to try to help to pay the interest and redemption on their State Bank bill. Is that the sort of financial advice that Wayne Goss is receiving in Queensland? In its last 2 1/2 years in government in Queensland, the National Party created 196,800 jobs. In its first 2 1/2 years, the Labor Government created just 5,900 jobs. That is in spite of 16,400 new positions in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goss Government has been a tragedy for Queenslanders. It would be a tragedy if all that was achieved under so many years of progressive government were to be lost. Already our growth has slowed; interstate immigration has slowed; and our lifestyle has deteriorated. Queensland could well be left with the only Labor Government in the whole of Australia as the Labor pawns fall all around our country. When he was trying to get elected in 1989, Goss pledged that all he wanted was one term. He said, `Just give me one term to straighten this mess out'. Let us hope that Queenslanders make sure he has only one term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP's behaviour during this election has been disgraceful. It is trying to run it like a union ballot, full of vote stuffing. It rushed the election in the shortest possible time. Even today we get the quite disgraceful revelations that ALP representatives in the central Queensland town of Moranbah have tried to bribe the Independent candidate to secure his preferences on a how-to-vote card. The ALP has been caught red-handed corrupting the election process. The CJC has been provided with a transcript of a conversation between ALP representatives and the Independent candidate in the marginal seat of Charters Towers. This is the way the Labor Party thinks an election should be run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the fiasco of unmarked ballot papers being found in the dumps around the Gold Coast. What sort of way is this to run an election?  It might be good enough for unions, but it certainly is not the kind of standard one would expect in a civilised democracy; yet this is the kind of behaviour Labor considers is appropriate in an election. We can only hope that Queenslanders will be spared any more of this punishment. The only difference between Queensland and Victoria is another term of Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cain did not ruin Victoria in one term; it took him a couple. It took Bannon a couple of terms to wreck South Australia. It took Labor a couple of terms to wreck Western Australia. In spite of the great resilience and natural strength of the Queensland economy, in spite of the tremendous financial state in which the Nationals left that State and delivered the treasury bench to Labor, it will take only a  short period of the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that we have seen in this Federal Budget and that we have seen from the Goss Government to bring Queensland to the same kind of economic ruin that has been delivered to other States around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Queensland do not want more taxes. We want a continuation of the idea of us being a low tax State. We want a continuation of progress and development. We do not want obstacles put in the way whenever any project is proposed. That, of course, is the Labor philosophy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that can be said about this Budget deficit is that at least it is out in the open; it was not hidden in the back pocket during the election campaign like the former coalition Government Treasurer did when he did not have the guts to admit to the Australian people that the Budget deficit he had run up in the infamous family Budget was significantly higher than this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the honourable member's attention to the reaction of the money markets. If it was such a disaster, why did they take it in their stride?  If it was such a disaster, why did Japan have a Budget deficit about one and a half times as big as a percentage of its GDP? Is the honourable member criticising the Japanese for doing the same thing for essentially the same reasons as we did?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member talked about low taxes and high taxes. The message was that the Labor governments are high taxing governments, but Liberal governments are low taxing governments. How come Australia is the third lowest taxing country in the OECD? If we are such high taxers, why are we not further up the scale? Why are we not up at around No. 1 or No. 2?  That shoots down the honourable member's arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned this week's Queensland election and some of its irregularities. One thing we did not do was run some of the most scurrilous ads ever seen in Australia, borrowed from the Americans&mdash;the Willie Horton blood-on-your-hands-type advertisements which target families who have already suffered and use that suffering in the ads. That must be a low point in political advertising in Australia.

While other countries were out building factories, we were sticking a lot of our wealth into the CBDs of our major cities and the glut of office space we have now. Instead of using that money in a way that was constructive for Australia, they stuck up more high rise buildings in our major cities. I think it is a good sign that we have got rid of those cranes. I think it is a good sign that at last some of the investment is going where it is needed&mdash;into factories; for example, the $600m factory in Adelaide and another $700m in Melbourne, which the Opposition's tariff policy would get rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member wants to talk about hidden taxes, let us talk about some of the hidden taxes the blokes opposite have. The most obvious are the road charges. In an address to the National Transport Federation's annual conference at Surfers Paradise, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had this to say, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason we haven't specified the details as to the appropriate form of road user charges is not to duck the issue. If I stand for anything since I've been Leader of the Opposition it's been for my willingness to be open and honest and tell you the way it is.</PARA>
<PARA>Repeatedly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has put to the Leader of the Opposition that we would like to know how the Opposition will raise the extra $4 billion to maintain roads in Australia. We are not the only ones. Yesterday the National Farmers Federation also joined in asking the Leader of the Opposition to detail to its members how the Opposition will raise those charges. Until Opposition members do, I think they will be hounded, and rightly so, to tell Australians what they should know about the charges they will face if they are lumbered with a Federal Liberal government after the next election. If the honourable member wants to talk about hidden charges and hidden taxes, let us start with the Opposition's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is about jobs and reducing our unemployment. In the Australian community a lot of people put too much emphasis on what governments can do. Governments can play a role, but they cannot do everything. I think it really is a partnership between governments and the private sector. It is the vitality and initiative that is shown in our private sector which will solve the unemployment problem rather than anything governments can do. But governments can play a role. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget this year we did not let Australians down. There was $350m allocated to local councils to help solve unemployment problems. I have noticed the reaction of Liberal members in Western Australia&mdash;I am not sure about other States&mdash;who sceptically called it pork-barrelling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Absolutely', says the honourable member for Maranoa, indicating the sort of mentality that is out there. I take it from the honourable member's interjection that he would not have had a part of that $350m. In fact, I know that is true, because the Leader of the Opposition said that we should not have a deficit of $13 billion and that he would chop off $6 billion to $7 billion. I wonder what that would do to unemployment. I wonder whether unemployment would go up or down under such a policy. My guess is that it would go up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help the unemployed, the Budget provides an extra $87.8m for Jobstart wage subsidies, including subsidies linked with training programs, to help an additional 33,000 adults gain work experience and skills over the next three years. This will mean that Jobstart will help a total of about 104,000 people over the next 12 months. Jobstart rates will be adjusted to boost employment, particularly for the long term unemployed. It is expected to assist 19,500 long term unemployed people in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional funds have been allocated to Skillshare community based assistance of $22 1/2m in 1992-93 and $96.3m between 1993 and mid-1996. Additional accredited training places for adults at TAFE or other institutions will be $16.9m in 1992-93, with an additional $67.6m over the next two years. In total, the Government will provide $1,150m in funding for labour market programs in 1992-93 compared to expenditure of $598m in 1991-92. That is what governments can do to assist long term unemployed, and I think it is a responsibility of government to do it. Of course, under the Opposition's policies, it would not get anywhere near that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area in which governments have a responsibility is income support. We know what the policy of the Opposition is on that: after nine months you are out&mdash;no support.

Somehow I think it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I am saying that in the role that governments can play, this Government has done what it can and what it should do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In actual fact, in part, the honourable member is right when he says that it is our fault. What we have done is made the Australian economy more efficient. We have internationalised the Australian economy. The growth in manufacturing exports is testimony to that, because currently we export more in manufactured goods than we do in agriculture. But that has been a deliberate shift of policy and we have been endorsed at the ballot boxes four times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a few examples of what this Government has done which has created unemployment. We have brought in better work practices and have unions actually work with bosses to turn out better products at a cheaper price so that we can sell them overseas. The Ford Motor Co. had about 26,000 people working for it, and its work force is down to 6,000. Our micro-economic reform on the waterfront has halved the work force down there. These are just a couple of examples which show the way in which the Australian economy has shifted over the last eight or nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been deliberate policy and it was long overdue. It is a policy which should have been implemented years, if not a couple of decades, ago. But at least it was done. In part, the shift in that policy has led to the high unemployment rate that we now have. There is no doubt about that. The other cause of the high unemployment rate is the high participation rate&mdash;historically high, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker. If we had the participation rate that the last Liberal Government had, we would now be looking at unemployment rates somewhere between 6 and 8 per cent instead of 11 per cent. That is a reflection of the number of people who have come in and started looking for work&mdash;we have a participation rate of around 63 or 64. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of causes for the unemployment rate being pushed up, but out in the wider community what is seen is just the single figure. I contrast that figure now with the figure 10 or 15 years ago, although I do not think we can class unemployment in the same way as we did back then. There are more part time jobs and more women, in particular, who want to join the work force now than there were some time ago. That is reflected in the participation rate. It is not fair to compare the unemployment level nowadays with what it was. That is not an excuse; it is an explanation about where we are. Of course the rate is too high. If people in Australia want jobs, it is up to governments and the private sector to provide those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is not helped by some of the pronouncements we have heard from the Opposition. One that is causing a lot of concern is wages policy, which does have a direct impact on employment. The last thing Australia needs now is to go into a situation where we have a wages free-for-all and where the bosses and the unions start slogging it out again. I was intrigued to look at what the Leader of the Opposition had to say about wages policy before he became a politician and, eventually, Leader of the Opposition. Back in 1985 he wrote an article for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. In the 4 October edition of the BRW, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An accord is essential. . . The economic achilles heel of the Fraser Government (and of the Whitlam Government) was its failure to develop a viable and relevant wages and incomes policy of that sort.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the accord. He stated in another BRW article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Liberals really need to recognise the wages area as their achilles heel and to come up with an alternative. At the risk of being accused of heresy, might I suggest that it may be desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord-type agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Leader of the Opposition before he became a parliamentarian and free of all the pressures that he has now from the people who sit with him. I think he was right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the accord has been one of the strengths of the Labor Government. It has allowed the Government to sit down with the workers of Australia and work out a policy by which we can guarantee them income security through the social wage and avoid industrial disputation, which is of great assistance to the employers of this country. It also gives employers a predictable outcome as to what wages will be next year and the year after that, so that they can actually sit down and plan their businesses in a way which will not see them upset by having the sort of free-for-all that existed prior to the accord being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes left to me I want to touch on the area of Medicare, and it does relate in part to the wages policy I just mentioned. The Leader of the Opposition has some very strong views about youth wages and wages for the Australian work force. His policy on youth wages is well known: he wants them to get $3.00 or $3.50 an hour depending on their ages. For the Australian work force, the Leader of the Opposition does not believe that the national wage case should go ahead and that they should slog it out in the marketplace. This really means that the strong do well but the weak do particularly badly and, in fact, could go backwards under such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting to see the health policy of the Opposition and the figures provided to us by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. According to the Department, if the Opposition's health policy were to be implemented, the total moneys collected by the private health insurers would be $2,113m by using carrots and sticks to get people back into private health insurance. But what is surprising from the Department's figures is that, of the $2,113m, $1,591m goes straight to the doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the Parliamentary Library have a look at those figures and give me a breakdown on how that $1,591m would be split up. Before I give the figures to contrast the $3.00 wage for youth and nothing for workers with what this would mean to a very privileged group in society, I will read the preamble from the Parliamentary Library. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90 Medicare income of medical practitioners in private practice amounted to approximately $3,362.4 m.. Of this figure, 7.24 per cent went to `part-time' doctors, i.e. $243.4 m., leaving $3,119.0 m. going to `full-time' doctors. Assuming the same ratios and proportions as applied in 1989-90&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the first assumption: that extra money going to the medical profession will fall in the same ratio as it currently does&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$1,476 m. of the $1,591 m. claimed by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services as `additional payments to doctors' under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> proposals would go to `full-time' doctors, an increase of approximately 47.3 per cent over 1989-90 Medicare income levels. This increase results in the following incomes:</PARA>
<PARA>It is staggering to know that the medical profession of Australia will get a 47 per cent pay rise from a policy enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read a few examples: an anaesthetist who received $142,000 in 1989-90 from Medicare, under Fightback would get $210,000, which is an increase of $68,000 a year; and a dermatologist who in 1989-90 under Medicare received $279,000, under Fightback would get $411,400, which is an increase of $132,000 in one year. Not a bad little pay increase when one thinks about it, for a very privileged group in society. I draw that to the attention of the House to show the impact of the income distribution in Australia resulting from the policies which are being enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Wide Bay say that this is the tenth and last Budget of this Government; let me tell him, it is not. We will be back again next year after the election because there is no way that the people of Australia are going to cop a 15 per cent tax on everything they buy and every service that is provided to them. I am quite confident that when the people of Australia sit down and have a look at the Opposition's policies compared to our policies, they will react in the way in which I know they are reacting now. I do listen to the people in my electorate, and I have not met one person who supports that 15 per cent goods and services tax. That, above everything else, will ensure the election of the fifth Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I say that this 1992 Budget is a bit like the 1991 Budget&mdash;yet another bitter disappointment. In fact, it seems to have sunk almost more quickly than the 1991 Budget did; hence we have seen the Government's desperate attempts to try to revive interest in its need to increase taxation. The 1992 Budget really shows that the Government no longer has any answers to get us out of the mess that it has put us in. In other words, the recession that `we had to have'&mdash;the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was Treasurer, took such delight in inflicting on this nation&mdash;is now becoming an albatross which I do not believe this Government will ever get rid of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of such concern is the fact that the Budget comes on the heels of the February economic statement, the one that was supposed to solve our problems and has clearly failed, and it seems to be going the same way. In other words, we are seeing the recession prolonged because the Government does not seem to have any answers. Worse than that, what we have seen in the February statement and again in this Budget is that Australia is being put further into debt to try to shore up jobs. Unfortunately, those jobs are not those of the one million Australians who cannot find work; they are the jobs of the Ministers who cling so desperately to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, to show just how difficult the Government is finding it in trying to manage the economy, that this Budget is the seventh economic statement since February 1990. On top of that, we could include the new taxes that were announced yesterday&mdash;taxes that must have set an all-time record as being announced only four weeks after a Budget. Surely that must be something unique and something that shows just how out of touch and how desperate this Government is. Some cynic even suggested that maybe the Government is trying to engineer a statement led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at the fact that the Labor Party has taken great delight in criticising so many Australians for their entrepreneurial approach during the 1980s. But if we are honest about it, we have to say that the damage that may have been done to the Australian economy through the activities of some of the entrepreneurs pales into insignificance when we look at the damage that has been done to this nation, to the reputation of Australia, by this Government and which has continued with this Budget. We have only to look at what has happened to the exchange rate in the last few weeks to see the nervousness that the Government is now engendering on the Australian economy; confidence is now starting to become a major problem, and overseas investors are getting very nervous about where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at some of the details, we see that putting Australia into hock and borrowing more to try to maintain the jobs of a few selfish Ministers in fact will cost us dearly. If we look at the increases that are expected under the Budget and the interest that will have to be paid by the public purse, we see that it will rise by an amazing 26 per cent this year. But, on top of that, it will go up by 36 per cent next year. In other words, the Government, through its Budget, is loading up problems for the years to come. All the money that is continuing to be borrowed to shore up this Government will be paid by the next government, and clearly there will be a change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the scorched earth policies that have been pursued by the Prime Minister have hurt so many people. This Budget shows that we are getting more of the same. There really are no answers. All it does is to put us further into debt. I think someone has even put it that this is the new form of child abuse. The Labor Party is putting people, future generations, in hock. In fact, I heard a case of a person going to a friend who had just had a baby and handing a little letter to the mother and saying, `Here is the birthday present for your child. It is an IOU for $10,000. That is your child's share of the national debt'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, of course, less than four weeks after the Budget was brought down, we find that more taxes are being introduced. Not only are we borrowing; we are finding that we will have increased taxes. Of course, like anything with borrowing, sooner or later someone has to pay. I think all of us will have to pay. That is why I can stand here and say that I am very proud to be associated with the coalition's Fightback package because we really do offer some real solutions to the problems that this country faces. Therefore, the Government should stand condemned for the fact that this Budget offers so little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that the Budget really offers no hope for those who are unemployed. There are really no long term sustainable jobs in prospect. What it really shows, I guess, is that the Labor Party has clearly abandoned the worker of this nation. It is no longer the Party that it used to be. I am sure that some of the fine former leaders of the Labor Party would turn in their graves if they could see what has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area in which I have a particular interest is what is happening in employment in the transport area. If we look at the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transport and Communications Indicators: A Quarterly Review of Transport and Communications Activity</EMPHASIS>, we will see that under the heading `Transport and Storage Employment' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment in the transport and storage sector fell in the June quarter 1992, the fourth successive quarter of employment decline.</PARA>
<PARA>But of equal concern is the level of investment. Under the heading `Transport and Storage Investment' it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private investment in the transport and storage sector fell to $259 million in the March quarter 1992, continuing the downward trend that started in September of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are frightening figures: employment and investment are falling. It seems that clearly the Government has no answers, and we are all paying very dearly for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at unemployment, we see that another 17,600 Australians lost their jobs in August, the same month as the Budget was introduced. We now have nearly one million people out of work&mdash;10.9 per cent of the work force. We have double digit unemployment. Well I recall the Government some years ago&mdash;and the then Treasurer&mdash;talking with glee about the sins of double digit unemployment. Here we have the same man inflicting this on Australia and, worse still, not having the solutions to get us out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see the history of this whole problem of unemployment. It all goes back to the decisions that were made by the then Treasurer when he bludgeoned the economy with high interest rates&mdash;high interest rates that drove us into a recession. Having done that, he had the gall to say that this was the recession that `we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the problems of the current account deficit&mdash;which again comes back to this rising debt&mdash;we find that, if the July figures are any indication, we well face the prospect of having a current account deficit that could be as large as the one in 1989-90. That, I remind honourable members, was $21 1/2 billion for that year. Furthermore, I well recall that the Treasurer&mdash;in trying to reduce the concern about what was happening&mdash;produced a figure in the Budget figures of 1989 that forecast that that deficit would be only $18 1/2 billion. It has since been confirmed that Treasury disagreed with that figure. If Treasury had had its way, it would have stuck to the $21 1/2 billion and would have been right. That was a clear case of the Treasurer not just getting it wrong, but deliberately getting it wrong. I come back to the point that, having done this, having created a situation where nearly one million people are out of work, how can the Labor Party claim that it represents the workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the unemployment rate in some detail. We often hear the Prime Minister argue about the participation rate, how the participation rate in Australia has increased over the last few years and how, somehow, he should claim the credit for that. It certainly has increased, but if we look at some of the OECD's statistics we find that between 1974 and 1979 Australia's participation rate was the eighth highest in the OECD. Between 1980 and 1990, Australia's participation rate had fallen to eleventh highest in the OECD. Therefore, for the Prime Minister to come into this place and claim some credit for the increase in the participation rate is a gross overstatement of the situation because other countries have seen an even bigger increase in their participation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as I say, Australia has dropped from being eighth highest in terms of the participation rate of the working population, to eleventh highest. I think that the Prime Minister's claim really looks a bit thin, a bit hollow, when we draw that comparison with what has been happening in other OECD countries. Therefore, we could say that on that measure we have gone backwards. I think the Prime Minister ought to be a bit more careful when he tries to manipulate some of the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One statistic which I believe cannot be manipulated is this Government's presiding over the worst recession in 60 years and certainly the worst unemployment rates since records have been kept. I believe that all members of the Government should be hanging their heads in shame over what has happened. This is a very serious human problem. A number of parents have come to me&mdash;as I suspect a number have come to all members of this chamber&mdash;and they are absolutely desperate. They are terrified about the future for their children, particularly those children who will be leaving school this year. How will those kids get a job? How will they get training in many cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two parents came to see me in my electorate office a few weeks ago. They were desperately worried. They have a son who has a tertiary qualification in what should be a highly sought after profession. He had looked at 150 jobs. He had applied for over 100 of them. He still could not get a job. He is not sitting by idly. He has found something to keep himself occupied. I think an indication of how desperate is the situation is when we see the human side&mdash;the people who cannot find work even though they have tried for over 100 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the transport issues brought out in this Budget. We find that prospects for transport are much worse in this Budget. Although there has been an increase in spending, it is only for the next two years or, if you like, until after the election. The spending is clearly aimed more at buying votes than improving transport facilities. I think that I need go no further than the former Labor Party Prime Minister Mr Whitlam who, on 8 September when describing the performance of the current Labor Government, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government in action had made the 1980s a lost decade for the Australian railways. The Hawke government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with the present Prime Minister holding the purse-strings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had failed to exercise its constitutional and economic powers and duty to develop the rail system.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for all the talk from some Ministers about their concern about rail. They stand condemned by the former Prime Minister. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know a lot about these things and no doubt you would be sympathetic to some of the views that the former Prime Minister has expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at road funding we find again an appalling record&mdash;a cynicism. Up until now the Government has shown very little interest in road funding. In real terms, funding has in fact fallen every year until this current year. Although an increase has been announced this year, that in fact really only brings us back to the level of funding of a decade ago. Like rail, road funding has had a decade of neglect. I do not think that anyone ought to be under any illusion that given half the chance Labor would cut back again in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, another problem with transport is that taxes have not been addressed. Again, I need go no further than the Chief Executive of Mayne Nickless, Mr Bill Bytheway, who said recently in a speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nearly one third of Australia's transport costs went on Government taxes and charges, hurting Australia's micro-economic reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>What are those new taxes? This year the Government expects to raise $7.3 billion from fuel tax alone. Sales tax is expected to rise. Sales tax is likely to be extended to some farm trucks, something the Government was not too quick to acknowledge. Of course, tackling the payroll tax issue has proved to be just too hard. All of these taxes impact very seriously on industry, yet the Government appears to be doing nothing about it; in fact, it would prefer to continue to tax as hard as it can. There are grave fears in other sectors of the transport industry that extra taxes will be extended to them: for example, prescribed payments on taxis. Many taxi operators are very worried about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if we are to get the transport sector moving, we have to get taxes off. That is why the Fightback package will offer so much for transport. Not only will it help business with the removal of some $20 billion of taxes, it will have a very positive effect on our transport sector and, in more general terms,on our level of employment. It will create jobs. We want to give people such as those who have come into my office&mdash;I am sure like the people who have come in to the offices of other members&mdash;some real hope. We want to give businesses a chance to get going again. We want to get some of those taxes off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at what has happened since 1989 to get some indication of why our unemployment  is  so  high.  Since  1989  the</PARA>
<PARA>private sector has shed some 450,000 jobs. There is no doubt that, given the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right signals, they would employ all of those people again and more. That is what the coalition Fightback package is all about. We have a package that is fully funded. I emphasise the point that it is fully funded. There is none of this business of putting it on the international bankcard. It is fully funded. Not only that, we will be able to offer income taxes of around 30 per cent.

We are being offered more borrowings, more hope, more Mr Micawber. The fact that the Government and the Labor Party have abandoned the worker is a very sad indictment on the whole Labor movement. One way that we might sum up this Budget is to say that it is clearly another case of the cheque is in the mail, like it was last year, like it was the year before, and like it was the year before that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever differences of opinion may exist in the Parliament regarding Australia's economic direction and performance, I suspect there would be little argument as to whether there is a need in this country for greater efficiency and a continuation of the process of economic restructuring. In 1992, we are all well acquainted with the problems that confront our society. We know that as the international marketplace has matured over the last two decades, and as our primary products and resources have struggled against stiff competition, low world prices and closed shop trading blocs, the inefficiencies of our economic processes have been glaringly exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that, whether it is in the public sector at a Federal, State or local level or in the private sector, we have had to change our approach to doing business. As the ground rules of trade have shifted under us, and as we have come to grips with an international marketplace that does not necessarily need us as players, we have had to throw out old attitudes and jettison those practices which have been too slow, inefficient or cumbersome. Economic efficiency and environmental sustainability have become the important concepts, particularly to those of us who believe that our economic well-being is inextricably linked to our environmental well-being and that there is no automatic incompatibility between what is environmentally responsible and economically desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, given market factors and the cruel realities of survival in the marketplace, the search for efficiency has been most keenly felt in the private sector. Unlike the public enterprises and the public sector itself, which have traditionally been sheltered from the harsh taskmasters of profit and loss and limited capital, competitive industry has either adjusted to meet the marketplace, or it has failed. This has especially been so since enlightened governments realised the counterproductivity of protectionism, and we began to reign in tariffs, quotas and bounties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, of course, even the most dramatic of improvements to the efficiency and productivity of our industries cannot alone resolve our problems. As we have already said, for our economy to be strong it must be structured so that there is efficiency across the full range of economic activities, including in our public sector, our infrastructure, our monetary and fiscal policies, and our laws and divisions of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, by the very nature of a human being, no society can achieve anything approaching total efficiency. However, economies which are succeeding in the 1990s are those which have been able to steal an efficiency break on the rest of the world, particularly those involving technology, labour, finance, administration, transport, business attitude, infrastructure and communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great strengths of the Hawke and Keating governments has been their commitment to a complete restructuring of the Australian economy, including a comprehensive re-evaluation of the role and performance of the public sector. First, the Government dealt with Australia's longstanding micro-economic inefficiencies so that our society would operate in a fairer, more positive fashion, and our industry would have an environment in place which would encourage productive investment, decision making certainty, and the growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, once the taxation, wages and social non-policies of the previous conservative government had been corrected, the Government turned its attention to the vital micro-economic deficiencies which have been holding back our performance. There was reform of our roads system, the waterfront, our aviation industry and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this overhaul, the Government systematically worked to bring our hitherto old fashioned Dickensian public sector into the twentieth century. Labor correctly understood that even the most efficient, dynamic industry must be marginalised if the support networks are deficient; that meaningful economic readjustment and employment growth can occur only where the public and private sectors are complementary in their roles and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Federal Government is the public sector body which is responsible for the wider questions of economic management, it has been the focus of much of the restructuring analysis that has occurred over recent years. This is appropriate. However, it does leave us with the tendency to ignore the lower levels of government which have a great deal to do with the nuts and bolts of our economic efficiency. That is where I want to draw some parallels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments are obviously integral to that process, particularly as they are the providers of much of the transport infrastructure used in the trade cycle. They control many of the regressive forms of taxation which can either make or break industry. It is an understanding of this relationship between State governments and industry that has encouraged the Federal Government to look for a new funding formula between the Commonwealth and the States&mdash;a formula which more accurately reflects the needs and contributions of each participant at the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although State administrations are able in part to avoid the direct spotlight of economic efficiency accountability which descends upon those in the Federal arena, there can be no doubt that this level of government is under microscopic examination compared with that which occurs at the lower level of government administration&mdash;in other words, the municipal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an ex-alderman on a south western Sydney council, and past chairman of one of local government's peak bodies, the Prospect County Council, I have had a long term interest in the local government arena and its role in the economic and social processes. I have often described it as the forgotten force in economic management. It is the authority that has great power to either encourage or stifle economic activity or efficiency within its boundaries, and which some would argue tends to move merrily onwards in isolation from what is actually happening around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the ex-Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam so accurately predicted more than 20 years ago, local government is the tier of government that has experienced a quantum leap forward in its role and responsibility over the years. Whereas once councils' responsibilities seemed to begin and end with the three Rs&mdash;rates, roads and rubbish&mdash;now this tier of government is involved in an ever expanding range of activities, such as child-care, health and education, pollution control, employment schemes and so on. These, of course, are in addition to the all important and all encompassing task of town planning, which in a very real sense has a strong influence on the level and type of economic activity that occurs in a given municipality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a strong supporter of local government, I am not disappointed to see it expanding its role away from that of the basic service provider. I have for a long time felt that local government is best placed to deliver appropriate human services. After all, it understands local conditions. It is the tier of government that is closest to the constituency, and it should be best placed to target resources where they are most needed and where they will do most good. Although this expansion of role is in some respects an evolutionary process&mdash;a natural and logical progression based on obvious local advantages&mdash;it has had its biggest leaps forward where Federal and State governments have introduced programs to take advantage of their expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government has demonstrated its confidence in an enhanced role for local government through a number of targeted programs, most notably the local government employment and training scheme and the just announced local government capital works program. These are schemes which recognise that councils have the administrative capacity and local wherewithal to play a large role in their respective communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the strength of my support for councils in general, I have to say that I understand the concerns of those who see local government as an introspective and inward-looking tier of administration. To those people, local government is the weak link in the restructuring chain, a very important grassroots part of the decision-making process which has the capacity to either enhance our drive for economic efficiency and growth, or retard the process completely. It goes without saying that those critics of local government believe that the latter is the more common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that in the context of Australia's search for a new economic order the role and performance of local government is an interesting subject for debate. It is particularly interesting to contemplate whether or not aldermen have the responsibility to consider their actions in macro terms, or whether they should think simply in terms of their constituency. For example, should a council consider in its assessment process the employment generating impact of a given development, or indeed the wider economic impact, or should it simply take account of the law and local sentiment in making a decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of course is that aldermen, in common with other elected officials, must face the people every three or four years. Consequently, commonsense says that aldermen ignore the will of ratepayers at their own peril. To critics of local government, it is this propensity for aldermen to be influenced by residents' action groups that makes local administration the weak link in government. They contend that the understandable desire of residents in any locality to fight developments which they do not understand or believe will impact on their lifestyle, often means that aldermen shy away from taking the hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as these critics are concerned, Australia cannot afford to delay or stop developments which can provide jobs or foreign exchange, a situation which they believe is happening on a daily basis around the country. To be fair to local government, it is harsh and inaccurate to make the general observation that this tier of government is not pulling its weight as far as restructuring is concerned. Just as local government is administered differently from State to State, so does the style of administration differ from council to council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, many councils have put in place unilateral efficiency programs which have both greatly increased the productivity of their operations and had positive implications for their clients. From my discussions with aldermen and officers over the years, I have gathered the impression that there is a general recognition within local government of the role councils play in the wider economic processes. It seems to me that most aldermen appreciate the cumulative economic effect of council decisions around Australia and take their responsibilities seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confidently believe that the average alderman does not want to make decisions which have negative implications for the economic growth of our society, particularly decisions which destroy or delay job opportunities. That is not to say, however, that such decisions are not made. The inescapable fact is that local government in Australia does not generally have a good reputation with the business community both in Australia and overseas. Rightly or wrongly, many overseas companies and institutions will not invest in a project until after all the planning approvals are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that local government decision making processes, or at the very least the perception of their decision making processes, undoubtedly are having an effect on the investment decisions of private enterprise and, hence, the rate of economic consolidation in Australia. We must consider that in the normal course of business some local government bodies are dealing with development applications which are worth millions of dollars and involve substantial numbers of jobs. Where large amounts of capital are involved it is easy to understand how delays could be their greatest fear, and that this fear of delay is the greatest impediment to investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as I have said before, attitudes and approaches vary from council to council. Some have reputations for being confrontationist, contradictory and tardy, whilst others have an opposite reputation for cooperation and fast processing. It needs to be said, of course, that councils have every right not to be rushed into making affirmative decisions just because a potential development may have ramifications for jobs and the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law lays down guidelines which must be followed for approval, and there is a strong need for councils to ensure that prospective developments meet the environmental and planning guidelines which are specified for the area in question. It is also entirely appropriate for local residents to be consulted on such developments as they have to live with any planning or environmental mistakes that are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I must concede that it is not uncommon to hear of development delays and rejections which seem incomprehensible. Regrettably, in my parliamentary career I have heard of many cases where large applicants have despaired of the local consent authority and simply given up. Often that surrender has meant the loss of much-needed jobs  and, inevitably, export income. It is all well and good for those involved in local government to say that appeal mechanisms exist for those who disagree with a given council's decision. However, appeal mechanisms represent additional delays which can in many cases tip the viability scales against an investment. The mechanism can also result in the type of publicity which industry does not find either attractive or conducive to good business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, as I have already said, rejection is only one of the negative possibilities that exist within the decision making process. Most developers and industry executives will agree that delays and uncertainty during the application processing procedure can be more devastating than an outright rejection. I know of companies which have shut down entire production facilities and moved interstate in order to get away from an indecisive and nitpicking council. In actual fact, I know of one company in my own electorate which has, on several occasions, won the exporter of the year award which is thinking of moving overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would think that most honourable members in this House could also cite examples where delays and changes to the ground rules have encouraged business entities to give up on their plans. As I have already said, it has to be acknowledged that many councils have lifted their games tremendously over the past few years. Many now have pre-application procedures which encourage dialogue between council officers and prospective developers. Under this procedure the council is able to lay out what it expects from a development, and the developer is able to get an understanding of what will and will not be desirable on the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is normal now for councils to have self-imposed time limits for the processing of development applications. This brings a degree of certainty to the process of dealing with local government, the one ingredient which has sadly been missing in the past. If, for example, an industry is contemplating an expansion of its factory, and it knows that the council will not sit on the matter for month after month, it is more likely to have a positive attitude to the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, local government represents one of the important keys to our economic future in Australia. It may not receive much mention when economists dissect the big issues such as interest rates, productivity levels, housing starts and our trading performance. However, its role in the economic processes should never be underestimated. As with other sections of the community, local government is having to come to grips with a playing field which is far removed from the staid days when decisions were easy and relatively uncomplicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia has faced up to the new international order, we have had to become more hard-headed and more pragmatic. Local government cannot stand immune from that process, nor, I suspect, will it be allowed to. How it handles our changing circumstances will be important not only for our economy, but also for the concept of local government itself. If it can get it right it will continue to grow and diversify its role. The danger is if it cannot keep pace and adjust. Then it may lose all that it is aiming for. </PARA>

He went on to refer to `the gradual deterioration, and now the collapse, of the employment market', describing the level of unemployment as the `single most important and potentially dangerous issue confronting our country'.

They are not my words, but the words of his own Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members opposite are well aware, history is a wonderful thing. Without history we would not know that during the twentieth century more people have been murdered by their own governments than ever died as a result of war. Without history some might still accept, as the pseudo-intellectual apologists of the Left largely do, that Stalin's Russia, Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia and other communist utopias were models of freedom and prosperity. Without history and documents like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> there would be no way of knowing who said what about whom and when. However, there, the so-called saviours of the working class, the so-called saviours of Australia, are condemned out of their own mouths. And what was Malcolm Fraser's crime?  It was 450,000 people unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unemployment level of 6.9 per cent was a tragedy that had occurred against the background of a dreadful drought, a worldwide recession and the blackmail of the metal trades unions which, as all honourable members opposite well know, threw 100,000 of their so-called comrades on the scrap heap of unemployment. Of course, in this endeavour the union thugs were ably supported by that most compliant of all employer bodies, the MTIA. In stark contrast to the present depression, the 1982 recession was no deliberately engineered calamity; nor was it the handiwork of the beard-stroking trendoids in the Treasury. No bovver boy from Bankstown masquerading as a new class intellectual manufactured the recession of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore interesting to reflect on the views put forward by Mr Hawke way back in 1982, when he thought that Malcolm Fraser was such a bad fellow for allowing unemployment to get to 450,000. Even more interesting is the sorry record of his Treasurer&mdash;the bovver boy become Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the same man who continues to pretend that the present depression does not even exist; the man who has promised everything and delivered nothing. But his actions speak louder than his words, and his words ring hollow with the hypocrisy of his shallow, bully boy rhetoric. In 1986, boasting as usual of his so-called achievements as Treasurer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is even more competitive than it has ever been. Members of the business community can see a resurgence of the manufacturing structure coming and a rebalancing of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1986 that statement was nonsense. In 1992 it is a hallmark of the tragedy that has befallen over a million Australians. The then Treasurer's nonsensical reference to `a resurgence of the manufacturing structure' is nothing more than a sick joke&mdash;a poisoned apple, coated in the ridiculous jargon of the honourable member for Blaxland. In concluding that particular speech, the world's greatest Treasurer continued to massage his ego when he invited honourable members on this side of the House to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">watch growth continue in Australia. They should wait and see this country outstrip the others. They should watch Australians being put back to work . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When is this Prime Minister going to come down to my electorate of Dunkley and repeat those words to the 7,411 registered unemployed&mdash;plus the unknown number of those not registered? These are the people who are waiting for the resurgence of the manufacturing structure, because they are the ones who have been most terribly affected by this recession we had to have and the depression they did not want. Yet the Prime Minister&mdash;the man who only two years ago announced that Australia's economic position would improve `without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession'&mdash;now hides behind a ridiculous Budget document with the trendy, feel-good title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working for the Future: Jobs, Skills, Innovation</EMPHASIS>. This document, which should be more accurately renamed `How I created a Banana Republic in 10 years', begins with the incredible statement that `full employment remains a fundamental objective of the Commonwealth Government'. Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the Duke of Wellington once said, `If you believe that, you'll believe anything!'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called 1992 jobs Budget is all but dead&mdash;just like the job aspirations of so many Australians. It is nothing more than a cynical exercise in political expediency. After nine disastrous years this pathetic Labor Government and its Treasury advisers&mdash;most of whom could not cope with the economics of selling pies at the football&mdash;have produced an economy where one in nine Australians is out of work; regional unemployment is at depression levels; a large proportion of our youth has been consigned to a life of permanent unemployment; and large sections of Australian manufacturing, such as the agricultural machinery sector, have been deliberately dismantled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the failed One Nation manifesto, Labor's jobs fall into only two categories: jobs for union members&mdash;especially in the bureaucracy&mdash;and leaf raking exercises, new deal stuff, where hapless council workers spend six months digging holes and then six months filling them in. I want to suggest the form of budget that would lead to real jobs and long term jobs a little later in my speech. The jobs the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is offering are, as I said, short term, perhaps six months to a year at the most. They will generate little if any wealth and, far from solving Australia's financial problems, the policy of the Treasurer will make the situation worse as the nation continues to live on Bankcard to pay for a living standard it cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having run up a debt of some $200 billion, one might think that the Government would realise that it is time to stop borrowing.

As all Australians well know, Labor has failed dismally in its quest to achieve full employment. The overview claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persistent high unemployment is wasteful. Valuable output is lost, the overall skill base of the economy is diminished, personal potential and drive are interrupted, if not lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA>So here we have, in a nutshell, produced by the Government, a summary of the activities of the bureaucrats in Canberra's business extermination departments at their worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most insidious aspects of the policies of the last nine years has been the relentless attack on private enterprise and the legitimate activities of business. As the size and power of the bureaucracy has grown, the costs to business, especially small business, have forced many into bankruptcy. Not only has Australian business been bled white by the horrendous interest rates of the 1980s, but the pernicious impact of oncosts has led to increasing unemployment and business failures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that Australia now has one of the most hostile business environments in the world. To an Australian employer, a worker costs far more than just his wages. The most obvious oncost is payroll tax, which is a direct disincentive to employ labour and which will be abolished under Fightback. Under Labor, oncosts have risen sharply. Fringe benefits tax, increased superannuation levies, compulsory workers compensation insurance and the training levy are all direct taxes on the employment of labour and add directly to costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey by the Business Council of Australia published in June revealed that oncosts add at least 40 per cent&mdash;maybe even 50 per cent&mdash;to the wages bill. The pampered bureaucrats in the Canberra bunker refuse to recognise that many of the fixed costs imposed on business are imposed by government and the bureaucracy. Taxes, electricity and postal charges, holiday loadings, licences, permits, telephone charges, working hours, redundancy payments and so on are the direct result of legislation or the schemes of monopolistic government authorities. In most cases, such costs are absolutely crucial to the survival of business. For example, 60 per cent of the variable costs of producing chlorine&mdash;which is a basic part of the chemical industry&mdash;in this country is added to the cost of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attack employers for their inefficiency is to ignore the fact that many still manage to succeed despite the hostility of the bureaucracy towards wealth creation and despite the continued impediments placed in their way by this Government. Their success is a tribute to their tenacity and ingenuity. It is an indictment on Labor's failure to recognise that prosperity cannot be achieved by government. When President Coolidge said in the 1920s that the business of America is business he meant precisely that. He did not mean that Uncle Sam should go into business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 20 years Australians have had to foot the bill for the Government's numerous and ill-advised attempts to go into business. As Dr Michael Porter from the Tasman Institute has rightly argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must foster more local competition in skills and training, and avoid the centralist regimes so popular with Dawkins and Kirner. Government fix-it schemes, subsidies to exporters and the bureaucratic or `expert' picking of winners are precisely the wrong directions to go.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently, the financial black holes of WA Inc and the State Bank of South Australia and the shameful plundering of the assets of Victorians by the Cain-Kirner socialist Government provide yet more evidence of the inevitable outcome of government involvement in business. Yet this Treasurer and his predecessor continue to spend billions of borrowed money on the expansion of the training industry so that the unemployed can continue to be trained for jobs that do not exist. Both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are like their new class advisers: safe in the Canberra bunker, far away from those nasty, dirty factories in Melbourne and Sydney where the real impact of this depression is starkly apparent. The ageing flower children of the 1960s sip on their chardonnay and endlessly agonise over the problems of equal opportunity, occupational fitness, reclassification, entitlements to government vehicles and what a terribly unjust society Australia is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 this Government has been the architect of a record of 16 financial statements&mdash;all promising a better, brighter, more prosperous future; all promising that Australia was just about to turn the corner. Remember that famous J-curve statement? Instead, we have had more than one million unemployed, a horrendous foreign debt, a bureaucracy completely out of control with respect to financial responsibility, and a plague of whingeing single interest&mdash;or should I say vested interest&mdash;groups hell-bent on destroying the productive and wealth creating spirit and capacity of this nation. Not one of the 16 statements has worked. They are not effective and offer nothing but enduring hardship for those who are least able to bear the burdens of this depression. The dimensions of the unemployment problem are nothing short of a national disgrace. When one recalls that the Australian Labor Party was established during the depression of 1890s so that the interests of the working people could be represented in this Parliament, one can only be disgusted at the degree to which this once great Party has been hijacked by the new class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sight of the beard-stroking trendoids and the ageing earth mothers from the campuses of the 1960s now pontificating on the problems of the working class from the security of a well paid social engineering position in the bureaucracy is one of the most sickening aspects of modern Australia. The dimensions of the unemployment problem outlined on page 2 of the Budget document bring to mind those endless casualty lists of the Great War. Even Haig, the butcher of the Somme and Passchendaele, might blanch at the scene of devastation revealed on page 2&mdash;900,000 people have been sacrificed, two-thirds of them male and 65 per cent under the age of 35;  a quarter of the unemployed being aged between 25 and 34. I would be ashamed to print such a damning list. Labor says that the unemployment rate can be cut further by a sustained economic expansion. It certainly will not be cut using the figures in this Budget; it will not work. There is nothing sustainable in the few miserable short term jobs which are purely for election purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more ridiculous is the claim that there is a strategy and policy framework. This has all been said before. But, as all Australians, especially the one million unemployed, know, bureaucratic jargon does not result in real jobs. At the rate we are losing enterprises and whole industries, there will soon be few left who are in a position to compete. The Government has fed whole industries, hundreds of enterprises and their proprietors and employees to the jackals&mdash;those preying on the plight of those mercilessly sacrificed by a heartless former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister. These jackals, the extermination or liquidation industry, now have a huge range of laws and regulations to ensnare their hapless victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recession we had to have will do more damage for more years than anything in the past. Industry has been bruised before, but not decimated to this extent. Moreover, it has never tried to get moving from a position of deliberate entrapment in webs of rules and regulations. Businesses which recovered from the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s will not rise again. Business is flat on its back, nailed by the bureaucracy in an ocean of rules and regulations. The bureaucrats have seen to that and I believe they have at last succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has had many opportunities to create real jobs and to fix the structural problems facing Australia. It knows what to do, but it continues to do nothing. It knows the thugs at the Swanston Street Soviet will say no to anything that might threaten their vested interests and their power base. So what type of Budget would provide genuine, long term, wealth creating jobs? I am glad to see that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is sitting opposite. Perhaps they could have looked at his industry policy, which has now been widely distributed. If they had taken note of that, they might have got somewhere. First, the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) must put an end to the feeding frenzy of the sharks in the insolvency industry. The Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission has stated that he believes something like 20 per cent of the intellectual wealth of the nation has already been destroyed by the recession we had to have. I repeat: the hapless people involved have been consumed in a feeding frenzy. Australia is permanently poorer for such losses, and they are still occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, genuine enterprise agreements, as originally negotiated at SPC, must be encouraged. As can be seen from the Shepparton example, the self-interested meddling of the trade union movement and the Industry Commission is quite unnecessary. SPC has already achieved productivity increases in excess of 40 per cent and the workers have not been dumped on the dole queue by their mates at the Trades Hall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite should consider the consequences of a 40 per cent boost to the productivity in Australia's manufacturing sector. Every day the architect of the depression of the 1990s comes in here and, in true bovver boy style, blames everyone else for Australia's problems. However, as Adam Smith pointed out two centuries ago, competition and markets with properly defined property rights are the vehicles for economic success. As I have said, SPC has already achieved productivity increases in excess of 40 per cent and the workers have not been dumped on the dole queue by their mates at the Trades Hall. Centralist governments and the absence of these legal rights are the crucial factors in explaining the poverty of socialist systems which have performed so badly today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a good deal of pleasure that I rise to support the Government's Budget legislation and take part in this Budget debate. This Budget&mdash;like One Nation was earlier this year&mdash;is unmistakably Labor. It has `Labor' written all over it; over every page. It is an expansionary Budget and a job-creating Budget. It is one which seeks to alleviate the pain of unemployment and, in that sense, it is a very sensitive and feeling Budget. As a fiscal injection, it is compassionate yet, at the same time, responsible. It has been judged to be responsible by the markets. The end deficit&mdash;the equivalent of some 3.3 per cent of GDP&mdash;is certainly not reckless. It is quite a responsible fiscal injection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, since the day this Budget was introduced the Opposition has sought to portray it as irresponsible. In attacking it, those opposite have focused upon the instability of financial markets, particularly the international financial markets. They have focused upon an instability which is determined solely by international factors such as the deutschmark interest rate, and the sorts of factors which have seen financial markets in Europe in turmoil over the course of the last week, and particularly in the last two days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This criticism by the Opposition says a great deal more about it than it does about the merits of the Budget itself. It is a fair demonstration that those opposite will, as always, use any means at their disposal to engage in a bit of political point scoring. They will interpret the free working of international markets&mdash;the sorts of free working international markets which they are always maintaining they cherish dearly&mdash;as being in some way determined exclusively by the Australian Budget in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as those opposite delude themselves that the inconsequential letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to President Bush will determine US trade policy, they would have the Australian electorate believe that a world-wide increase in commercial interest rates is some sort of judgment on the Government in Australia. Recent events have shown this position to be quite fallacious. According to the Opposition's logic, recent movements in the financial market have actually been something of a vote of confidence in the Government. Unlike the Opposition, we do not make&mdash;as the US Embassy said in describing the views of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;`exaggerated and far fetched assumptions'. Nor, for that matter, do we consider that money market dealers&mdash;the sorts of characters we see getting around in garish shirts&mdash;are the adjudicators of what is or is not a good Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are more concerned about the views of the unemployed, the views of workers, unions and business. We are concerned about all of these people's views about what is right for the economy and what steps the Government should be taking. Ultimately, we are more concerned about gauging the views of real Australians than about taking time out to look at the Reuters screen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet when we see the markets move, it is the Opposition Leader who follows very quickly. In the meantime, the car makers, manufacturers, renters, chief executives, unionists and senior public servants are dismissed out of hand as being `ill informed' whenever they dare to comment upon policy or what should be happening. Access Economics will always get a bit of a guernsey from the Opposition, but certainly of late BHP has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition would start to listen it may hear that what people want, and indeed what people need, is a fiscal injection to get this economy moving. They want job-creating policies, not tax-consuming policies. They want new positions, not new impositions. From this Government&mdash;particularly in the form of this Budget and also in the earlier One Nation statement&mdash;they will get real jobs. We are focusing our energy on creating new jobs. We are certainly not focusing on shifting revenue from expenditure to consumption, as the Opposition would do. We are not, as the Opposition proposes, taxing life's necessities: bread, milk&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will be hearing a lot more about it. He will hear it every day, every week and every month right up to the election. The Opposition is the group in this country which is proposing to introduce a goods and services tax&mdash;a tax on everything that everybody consumes. A tax on their food, their clothing, their children's expenses, their transport costs and everything else. In doing so, the Opposition is proposing to collect more than half as much money as income tax raises in this nation every year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to New South Wales and return to the central theme of my remarks. John Fahey at least understands one thing&mdash;that is, the need to create jobs. I was particularly interested to see that he determined in his Budget that now is the time for a job creating capital works program. What he forgot to say was that the Federal Government and the GIO sale are paying for the jobs. But having said that, at least he has got the message that now is the time to loosen the purse strings not tighten them, as of course the Opposition would do. Now is also not the time to pilfer the purse of the public with a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With credit growth weak there can be no question of crowding out the private sector. It is not as if any of these programs are having any impact, other than a stimulatory impact, upon the private sector. On the contrary, the private sector is saying that it wants to pick up in consumption and in confidence. Only then will it join the Government in creating jobs. We can give it all the payroll tax relief that it talks about, but that will not create jobs if there is no increase in consumption, and consumption is hardly likely to pick up if a consumption tax is imposed on everyone's consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, consumption will pick up if the Government can quickly use its own capital works projects to create jobs, boost investment, increase construction and get projects moving. That is exactly what we have sought to do in the One Nation statement and what we have sought to reinforce in this Budget. It is worth pointing out that that is exactly what the world's most successful economy, Japan, has been doing&mdash;the country which the Opposition Leader criticises and frowns upon&mdash;to cope with the effects of the world recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation, we announced a standard gauge rail highway, massive road programs and taxation incentives for major projects. All these measures are aimed at stimulating growth in the economy and at providing confidence. In this Budget we have an employment package worth $742m in total, of which $345m goes to local councils for capital works. There are 411 municipalities which will benefit from that and those municipalities contain 70 per cent of the nation's unemployed. Hence, we can see that the assistance is well-targeted and compassionately applied. As it is local, its impact will be rapid. No time lags will be associated with this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the earlier contribution to this debate by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) who spoke about these jobs being something of a waste of time in his view. As someone who had something to do with the expenditure of CEP funds in New South Wales in the early 1980s, I can say that this money has been carefully targeted in such a fashion as to ensure that there will not be lengthy delays in its expenditure. The jobs will be real and will be created quickly with a minimum of delay and a minimum of bureaucratic involvement. That is something which we all should welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heavy expenditure on urban development, public housing and defence housing add to the job creating nature of the Budget. Much of this expenditure of course was already planned and was in the pipeline, but it is now being brought forward to coincide with the beginning of an economic upswing. That is going to give that economic upswing much greater momentum. If we contrast that with Fightback we see $7 billion, maybe $8 billion&mdash;we are never quite sure because those opposite will not spell it out exactly to the dollar&mdash;of fiscal stimulus taken right out of the economy. Fightback would inflict massive expenditure cuts just as a recovery commences&mdash;expenditure cuts targeted at the hapless victims of the recession. Of course, the only Fightback would be a fightback against economic recovery. In fact, I think the Fightback the Opposition is proposing would certainly deliver a knockout punch. It would not be a knockout political punch but a knockout punch at the economic recovery that is just getting under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then, the slug would not be evenly distributed. The Government's labour market training programs&mdash;such as Jobstart, where we see places being increased to 104,000 in this Budget, and Jobskills, which gets an extra 12,000 jobs funded in the Budget&mdash;are prime targets of the Opposition. They are right up in the front of the firing line. People on these programs, under the policies of those sitting opposite, would be left to the whims of the market. I suppose that these people, if they are young&mdash;and they would have to be a bit lucky as well&mdash;would get to earn $3 an hour. Alternatively, if they have a spare $30,000, or their parents have&mdash;which is pretty unlikely&mdash;they might get a chance to go back to university and do an arts degree. They could even get to attend one of those Gordon Gekko balls at Bond University. It would not be any trouble under the Liberal Party's policies, if people had the wherewithal, which of course they would not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Budget, training and education opportunities are very strongly supported, and I am delighted at the extent of that support. The Jobskills program has been boosted and an extra $92m has been set aside for additional adult training places; it is a huge boost. Furthermore, we see the TAFE system, once regarded as the very poor second cousin of education, having been transformed through this Budget into the National Training Authority, funded to the tune of some $720m over three years. That in itself will see the creation of an extra 100,000 places in TAFE. This Government is doing to TAFE education exactly what an earlier Labor Government did for university education in this country, lifting it up, giving it rightful support&mdash;the support it has been denied in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an earlier stage, potentially disadvantaged job seekers will benefit from this Budget through the extra $60m that has been targeted at our ageing high schools, and there are plenty of those, where the infrastructure has broken down and the schools are in bad repair. At a later stage, the same students who attend those schools will benefit from the new arrangements for Austudy, which will see a further 43,000 students become eligible for assistance. If they decide to go on to university they will also benefit from an expanded capital works program funded in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that, as a result of that funding, there is a major extension to the commerce facilities at the University of New South Wales situated in my own electorate. I am delighted to see that building program under way, which will be greatly welcomed by the people who will work in it, by those building it, and by the professors, students and staff who will have the opportunity to work in decent surrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compassion is not just about job creation and training. It also embraces child-care, support for the disabled, housing, welfare support and health. All of these areas, each in turn, are boosted in this Budget. In the area of child-care we see more generous fee relief measures costing some $68m in total over four years that will benefit 135,000 families. If ever there were a manifestation of the commitment of a government to child-care it is this Government's commitment in this Budget. For the sick and the disabled we see additional measures that will enable many of them to enter the work force. We also see an extra $41m for respite services and an increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit&mdash;all these greatly needed funding initiatives from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of housing we see an extra $64m provided over two years for rental housing; that housing will be managed by community organisations and local government. In addition, there is a new structure for rent assistance which will cost some $71m next year and provide benefits to some 440,000 low income renters in private housing. It is probably fair to say that no other measure could cause the Leader of the Opposition  so much pain, but, unlike the coalition, we do not view renters as second-class citizens. We had never thought about checking out lawns and using that as a criterion for determining who is a renter and who is not until quite recently, when we heard the outrageous assertion of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of support payments, I am delighted to see an increase of $6 per fortnight in the single pension, and some $10 in the fortnightly pension for couples. On top of this, we see an extra $44m in funding for nursing homes and a commitment that by April 1993 all full and part rate pensioners will be eligible for Commonwealth fringe benefits. No other measure could be of more assistance to the aged and the sick, and no other measure could bring greater justice to the pensioners who for years have bitterly complained about not receiving those fringe benefits as a result of being part pensioners only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I might say that one should pay credit to the Speaker of this House who was responsible for the McLeay report which recommended these measures. I know that no member of this House will be more delighted than Mr Speaker with the fact that his recommendations have been implemented and that this benefit will in future be available to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come to the area of health, the great yardstick of community compassion. From the Government we see an additional $1.6 billion being provided to public hospitals and, at the same time, a strong commitment to the Medicare system of universal health cover. We also see $71m being provided to reduce waiting times for elective surgery. No area better illustrates the difference between ourselves and our opponents because there is no doubt that there is no area of the Budget that attracts as much of their hostility as this does. Of course, those opposite have always been for health based purely on an ability to pay&mdash;privatising health, just as they would privatise people; a health system run by the doctors, for the doctors. They, along with the private health insurers, would be the winners. We cannot all be winners, and if they are the winners, as they would be, the losers would be the patients, particularly those who at the moment have all the benefits of Medicare and would find themselves dragooned into private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way that this is not a Budget for money market dealers, it certainly is not a Budget for highly paid doctors either. It is one aimed at helping the elderly, the sick and, most of all, the unemployed. It is aimed at fulfilling the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to tackle this question of unemployment, to stimulate growth in the economy, to bring back confidence and to get the country up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this is a growth Budget. It is a jobs Budget. It is a people-friendly Budget. It is a Budget that has been framed with the views of people, not the views of computers, in mind. It is a Budget framed by a government which listens. That puts us in stark contrast to the Opposition, which never seems to listen; it only seems to castigate. I have a great deal of pleasure in commending the Budget to the House. </PARA>

This is now just as important a time to the people of Australia as the election that concerned the nationalisation of banking in Australia some 30 or 40 years ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very concerned in the last fortnight, and even prior to that, that this institution of which we are a part is being somewhat torn apart by the attitude of the Government. I know the reasons why Government members are adopting the attitude they have. They simply want to trample upon the Opposition because they know that they do not have a policy and they know that we have a policy on which we will stand up and be counted. I am sure this is the attitude that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe this attitude will do the Government any good because, whilst at times we say that the people of this country of ours are not as nationalistic as we would like to see them, there is a great respect for the tradition we have in this parliamentary system of ours, the Westminster system, and we do not want to see it abused. This is occurring. There were words used in the Parliament today that I certainly do not know the meaning of and most Australians would not know the meaning of. They are words that should not be used. The Parliament should be better conducted than it is at present. It is disappointing for me and for many Australians that we cannot see better things being done in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all representatives of the people. This is the important thing. We represent the feelings of the people whom we represent. I am quite sure that today the great majority of our people are most concerned about Australia's economy&mdash;not the issues that are talked about, dominated by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and a few of the Ministers, each day at Question Time within this House. I worried when I looked up in the gallery today, yesterday and the day before and saw some people grinning and some who looked most concerned, and saw the young children from the schools sitting up there and wondering what is going on in this Parliament that is elected by them to represent people and to do the proper thing by Australia. I wanted to raise that because I believe it is terribly important today that some of us have a recognition&mdash;and I am sure the leaders of both the Liberal and National parties have it&mdash;of the responsibility we hold in being elected here to govern Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look back over 20 years, from 1992 to 1972, and think of the two or three years in which the Whitlam Government was in operation in this country, I see how our standards fell. How often when one was walking down the main street in one's town would somebody say, `Warren'&mdash;or `Bruce'&mdash;`there is something wrong. What are you going to do about it down there? We have been going downhill for many years'. This country has. I will not relate all the matters that cropped up at the time, but the industrial relations that everybody in this country was proud of went by the wayside&mdash;the accord, the association with the ACTU, the power given to unions to dominate the control and the policy of the Labor government of the day. </PARA>

We are on the verge, on the tip of the mountain, right now, with a debt on every Australian of over $8,000. We have lost markets. The Prime Minister talks about all the markets we are gaining and the monetary value of these exports. That may be so. I do not challenge that. But for a country with the rich resources that we have and are sending overseas&mdash;that we are basically not bothering to process here, in this land of ours&mdash;it is a great shame upon the Government that it has not utilised these things more. I know the speaker who will follow me, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), has been constructive, because he represents a large mining area of Australia. Although he belongs to the Government, he is realistic in some of the things he is trying to do for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to mention how this country has run down. We are like a run-down business or a run-down dairy farm, with a great national debt, an ill balance of trade and no sign of being able to overcome this while we have the One Nation policy which was brought down, the Budget that followed, and the extra tax Bills that followed that. They would not have been there if it had not been for the fact that somebody from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was able to locate them and give a warning to the Opposition. We took up the challenge and forced the Treasurer to come into this House to divulge those hidden taxes. That is the important thing the people want to know. This is the Prime Minister who in the 1990 election said, `There will never be a recession in Australia'. We have had a deep recession. I know we are supposed to be coming out of it. We have had a depression&mdash;the worst in 60 years. This has been spoken of in this place a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, as the previous speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton), said&mdash;and I am sure he was genuine&mdash;that within the Budget the Government is creating jobs: $1.4 billion was allocated to create jobs and $345,000 to councils. I accept that my electorate, on the coast of New South Wales, received $3 1/2m to $4m. I am grateful for that. I hope councils are putting it into its proper perspective to spend. But that is not creating permanent jobs. This is what we have to realise. Every day we tell the Government that. There is nothing in this money. This is taxpayers' money. As I look around the room here today at the wage earners, I wonder whether they have ever stopped to think how many unemployed people they are keeping yearly, weekly, monthly. They should think of these things and get down to the bedrock of how much of the taxes of the people who work in Parliament House, and the people who work in the councils and businesses, are going to pay unemployed people. I know we all want to help unemployed people. I wish the Government would help them and not just give them temporary funds that will peter out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government took a long time getting around to this. The Left said to the Prime Minister months ago&mdash;that was part of the reason why he was elected Prime Minister of Australia&mdash;`You'd better do something about unemployment. You'd better create CEP jobs or something else to create employment'. He took a long time making up his mind. Election day was approaching day by day; therefore, something had to be done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be critical of the Prime Minister throughout my speech on this Appropriation Bill, but these are the things the people of Australia have to realise. The Prime Minister attempted to divert attention. He went offshore, as we know, to tell the Australian people that it was time we got rid of the monarchy; that it was time we got rid of our flag; that it was time we became a republic. Now he intimates that it is time to not have a Senate. These are the very principles this country stands by&mdash;the safeguards within the Constitution. Yet he went offshore and told that to the people of this country, and the Indonesians&mdash;and the world. Mr Hawke would not have done that. Bob Hawke was a shrewder leader. He would not have done that. He may have had some of it in mind, but he would not have said that. That is being fair to him. I think we ought to realise this. </PARA>

We are very rich in natural resources in this land of ours. We export, but we process very little. I was recently up in Malaysia and South Korea with a delegation and I was amazed to see the progress that those countries are making. I do not know what their industrial laws are, but if one goes out on the roads at 7 o'clock in the morning the big machinery and trucks are working and if one goes back at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening the same machinery and trucks are still working on roads, constructing the buildings and working in industry. Those countries are attracting and establishing the industries that we should have in Australia employing our own people to overcome the problem we face with one million people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It amuses me to see the Prime Minister and the Treasurer trying to defend themselves every day in this House. It does not matter whether they are responding to dorothy dix questions from either the Government or the Opposition, the answer is always diverted back on to Fightback or to GST. But the issue today is jobs and the employment of Australian people. The issue is to get people back to work so that the taxpayers will not have to pay out so much in unemployment benefits, so that our national debt of $150 billion can be repaid, and so that Australia can become a healthy country. We can then do something permanently to help our disadvantaged and aged people and to give Australians a proper health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufacturing sector that I commenced to speak about a moment ago is so important to Australia. It is a platform for economic growth. We do not process our rural commodities sufficiently. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has often mentioned this both in the House and elsewhere around the countryside. We should be able to process what we produce in this country. We are being challenged on dumping and on the tariff issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter where one goes, in the supermarket store or anywhere else, one sees products that are being grown and processed in some other country 12,000 kilometres away, then transported to Australia and sold in our markets. This country has the technology; I am sure that it has the will to work. I have no doubt that if we put our young Australians in harness they will work and respond to the challenge, if only they could get a job to be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a feeling amongst the industries in this country that we do not want manufacturing in Australia. I have talked to industry, as I know many other honourable members have, and there is a feeling that Australia is not the place to manufacture. Some of us believe that it should be. I mentioned a while ago about industries going offshore. Between 200 and 300 companies have been established in Malaysia in the last couple of years, or are currently negotiating to go there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One chap went up there to manufacture doors. He was originally going to supply the Australian market here, but he is now supplying the European market and the world markets. I know that wages in Malaysia are cheaper, but it also has the technology. Free economic zones exist a bit further up in China. Those countries in the long term will take over from some of the countries on the present Asian scene. These are the challenges that Australia faces, but the important thing is that we can measure up to these challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only achieve this if we have proper industrial relations; if we get our people back to work; and if we overcome the high overhead that we have in social security&mdash;and I refer to unemployment relief. It is possible for us to reduce the national debt, keep our inflation down and fix up the balance of trade through our manufacturing industries. I am convinced that we can compete with those other countries around the world which are beginning to challenge us. But the Government must help. The Government must be sympathetic to the fact that we want manufacturing, whether it be cars, footwear, textiles and clothing, engines for trains or rolling stock. The fact is we can do these things here in this country if we can get the economy back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about the rural community. I belong to a party that has always stood behind the farming community. I know things have changed. The farming organisations are getting stronger and, to a certain degree, they are getting themselves involved in the political issues of Australia. I do not blame them for that. But we have to join with those organisations and lead the way. I know that the Liberal and National parties will do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmer in Australia today receives very little financial support from the Government. In fact, it comes down to $97m in the Budget that we are debating here tonight. Much of the income from that is a levy charged upon the farmers for inspections and other things. Basically, the rural industries in this country are standing on their own feet. I want to see a backstop given to farmers further down the line for things such as natural disasters. In particular, we want to see severe drought included within the natural disasters provision. We want to have a policy and an aim which will be able to assist those people who at this stage have tremendous debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A colleague of mine said the other day that a survey of 80-odd farmers within his electorate showed that there was an average debt of $450,000 on each farm with an average value of the real estate stock and plant of about $600,000. I know that not all of those farmers will survive, but we in the Opposition are right behind the family farm. We believe that in the long run, no matter what happens to this country, the rural producer will be the one who will get us out of the hell of a mess that we are in at present. He is the one who will get us out. Never mind about American wheat. We will find an answer to that because we have the ability to do so, if not at present then some time in the future. Wool will come back; our dairy products are there. We have stable primary industries. We have to be able to help our primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said a while ago that the bottom line is that, in cooperation with banks, we somehow have to ensure that farmers are not put off their farms. I get concerned about the fact that the States in most cases have either sold their State banks or are taking certain responsibilities away from them. I have always looked upon the States as being responsible for rural reconstruction, with the assistance of the Commonwealth. Rural reconstruction is the backyard of the States because the State Ministers for agriculture and the Treasury deal with these people in every way such as in PP boards and in councils. It is a great shame to see the way that the private banks in Australia at the moment are closing down business and rural properties that we want to see kept open. That is the way we are going today in Australia. I believe that our State banks were very important. I would like to say more about the farming community, but I may have another opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am totally behind Fightback. I think that user pays is a very important factor in our policy. If I want to go out and buy a dear motor vehicle, dear furniture, expensive clothing, shoes, tables or anything else one likes to mention, then I am the one who is going to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the people who will benefit from this are the people on low incomes; those people we talked about in the House today&mdash;the 47 per cent of people who have incomes under $27,700. Two million of those people are women, by the way. Two million of those people will not get any relief, so far as the announcements that have been made by the Treasury in the Bills before the House at the moment are concerned. I believe Fightback will be a direct change, and nobody can tell me that it is not time for a change in direction in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 is one of three Bills that have come back from the Senate, the Senate having finished its deliberations late last night. At the outset I want to say&mdash;and this remark applies to all three Bills, as do some of the other remarks that I will subsequently make&mdash;that I have only just come into possession of the amendments. I understand that they were available immediately before the dinner break but, unfortunately, if that was so the message did not get to me, and I do not know whether it was conveyed to the Opposition. Even if it had been possible to look at these amendments during the dinner break, unfortunately, the information that accompanies them is zero and any deliberations would have been virtually futile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will understand, Mr Deputy Chairman, when looking at the schedule of amendments to this Bill, that they simply refer to changes to words and terminology in a whole host of clauses in one of a series of Bills. That, to me, and to anyone else, does not make sense on its own. The Government has not deigned, of course, to issue a supplementary explanatory memorandum or anything which would enable detailed consideration of what are very complex, as well as very important, taxation measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Committee that the three Bills, of which this is only one, were introduced into the House as recently as 26 May. They were passed by the House two days later on 28 May. It does not take an Einstein to work out that the second reading debate was conducted under the guillotine. So this Bill, along with the other two, was considered in a matter of an hour or so. Perhaps a natural consequence of that debacle is that we now have a whole raft of amendments. It is the old story: the Government comes in with legislation which is not adequately thought through, it refuses to debate the legislation in any detailed way in the House of Representatives and so it goes off to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was successful in having the Bills referred to a Senate committee. Some honourable members will recall that that Senate committee had only just been formed and was ready to sit, when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), bless his little heart, came out with a press statement agreeing to amendments which he had resisted all the way up the line until that very time. I know that Senator Walsh was vocal in his criticism&mdash;and even, one sensed, a little vitriolic&mdash;about that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has 28 separate amendments. Again, one does not have to be a genius to realise that it is a dog's breakfast. It was to begin with, and it is even more so now with so many amendments. Not having had the chance to consider the amendments only makes the position worse. The crowning irony, if you like, is that these three Bills, including the one we are discussing, were part of a package misrepresented by the Government as sales tax simplification legislation. The simplification is not readily apparent, particularly as, in the first case, it totalled 1,500 pages. Obviously, because of the amendments now before the Committee, it was not thoroughly done or well thought through and, in other words, was totally inadequate. So here we are looking at legislation, unable to behave like legislators and again seeing another example of the way this Government treats the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember at the time of the original legislation, that is in May, two days before we were to debate it in this place, getting hold of draft copies and sending them overnight by courier to tax practitioners in Sydney, only to have them get back to me the next morning to tell me to forget about receiving any detailed assessments of these Bills for at least another week. If that is the response of tax practitioners involved and vitally interested in this legislation, I ask the question: how does the Government possibly expect mere parliamentarians to give the Bills the consideration they require in two short days on top of their other commitments? As if to add insult to injury, we have two hours notice of a raft of amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 before us now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we are debating these Bills again in the Committee is that they were initially rammed through the House of Representatives without adequate drafting or consideration. It was left once again to the Senate to expose the many problems with this legislation and to force the Government to change it in ways that render it at least slightly more workable. By the time these Bills got to the Senate, it was apparent that large sections of the business community and the accountancy profession had grave difficulties with numerous aspects of what was proposed in all three, but, in particular, the one before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had some rather interesting responses from some of those practitioners and professionals. We heard people from responsible accounting organisations, people with no real axe to grind. For example, a Mr Firmstone from the Institute of Chartered Accountants said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute of Chartered Accountants per se was not involved in the consultative process.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Geoff Petersson of the Taxation Institute of Australia chimed in and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very much the same situation with the Tax Institute.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Senserrick from the Australian Society of Certified and Practising Accountants said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Society of CPAs was not asked to comment directly on the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Eakin from the Retailers Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of consultation, I think we have to make the point that we were not consulted at any stage.</PARA>
<PARA>Whom did the Government and the Taxation Office consult with? The answer, obviously, is no-one. The Government really could not give a damn about what the business community or tax practitioners might think about these Bills, no matter how they are expected to comply with them when they end up as Acts. This Government just goes ahead anyway and drafts legislation without consultation and then wonders why its legislation runs into so much difficulty when it tries to ram it through the Parliament&mdash;in particular, through the Senate. Unfortunately, it would be naive to think that the Government is in any way concerned about the interests of the business community when it comes to the administration of its ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is concerned only with the political implications of the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992. In particular, it is interested in whether it will provide a politically useful contrast to the coalition's infinitely superior goods and services tax proposal and its proposal, under the Fightback package, to remove the bulk of the Government's indirect tax base and payroll tax as well. On that count, of course, it goes without saying that the legislation fails manifestly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 but I must apologise to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). When he was lamenting the lack of notice of these Bills, I thought he was referring to the amendments that had come about in the Senate&mdash;amendments which have arisen only in the last couple of days. I did not think that he could possibly be referring to the amendments which the Government had introduced for they, after all, were circulated in the Senate on 19 and 20 August. It is quite clear that the Opposition has had the opportunity since then to become familiar with the material. I think it is a little unbecoming for the honourable member for Curtin to blame the Government simply because his party seems to have some communication problems with the Senate. Having met some of the Opposition's senators, I can understand how this might come about. It is certainly not the fault of the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am hoping that one day we will achieve a little more sensible approach to legislation in this place. The situation in regard to this Bill and others was best summed up in a submission to the Select Committee by Coopers and Lybrand. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As sales tax is a self-assessing tax, it is imperative that this `new law' which replaces existing sales tax legislation meets all the tests of a good statute, that is, simplicity, equity, efficiency and certainty. In generality, in our opinion, the legislation as it presently exists, fails all four tests.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, and was, the judgment of the coalition. But there we have it, one of our major accountancy practices in Australia has said that this legislation is a failure on no fewer than four major counts. Mr Firmstone, once again, from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think that on balance certainty has not been added to. It has been detracted from . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is as a result of this Government's legislation. The Government's backdown on key aspects of the draft legislation means that the bulk of the sales tax simplification exercise has simply been a complete waste of time. So what we have now is a rehash of the old sales tax system, but with none of the benefits that stemmed from the old system's standing in law and resulting certainty in administration. As far as the Institute of Chartered Accountants is concerned, any benefits resulting from this legislation will accrue to the accounting profession only. I am sure honourable members understand what he means by that. In other words, it will generate a great deal of work for tax specialists amongst the accountants and in the legal profession. Mr Firmstone also said to the Senate Select Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We doubt that it will, in the ultimate, be easier for taxpayers to work with. It will be easier for tax consultants to work with, but the language of it and the sheer size of it is such that I do not think that taxpayers are going to be any less daunted in their task of trying to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA>The most interesting aspect of the Senate Select Committee hearings, however, was that virtually all the witnesses, when asked, observed that the wholesale sales tax system would be better replaced by a goods and services tax. They are just more voices being added to the chorus in support of the Fightback package and its approach to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most scandalous aspect of this wholesale sales tax simplification exercise, however, has been its bad timing. These farcical goings on caused by the Government's failure to consult and to properly debate the legislation in the House have served to delay the implementation of the Government's so-called reforms to the wholesale sales tax system. So we are faced with a situation whereby the Government will be introducing major changes to wholesale sales tax legislation which will now have a start-up date as late as 1 January 1993 or, possibly, 1 February 1993 because of the delays in the passage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The start-up date is perilously close to the next Federal election. If and when, as I believe it will, the coalition wins that election and scraps the wholesale sales tax system then Australian business will have been forced to endure enormous compliance costs in coming to terms with a new sales tax system that has a lifespan of only a few months. This is an outrageous proposition. It is outrageous that business should have to wear these increased compliance costs for absolutely no worthwhile purpose in the event of the right outcome at the next election. The only purpose that this legislation will serve is a shabby political purpose meant to benefit the Government. The Government wants to tart up the wholesale sales tax in a vain attempt to salvage some credibility for its indirect tax system ahead of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's entire approach to indirect taxes has been thoroughly discredited by the coalition's proposals to abolish virtually the entire existing Commonwealth indirect tax base and replace it with a broad-based single rate goods and services tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is prepared to pay virtually any price to take the heat off its destructive wholesale sales tax system. It is an indirect tax. I am not denying that. If that means imposing an enormous and potentially unnecessary additional compliance cost on Australian business then, under this Government, so be it. The other benefit, of course, of the Government's approach to the wholesale sales tax changes is that in the unlikely event that the Labor Party wins at the next election the wholesale sales tax base can be greatly expanded to constitute a de facto consumption tax. It is well along the road. These measures take it that much further. The Government will desperately need such a consumption tax in order to deliver on its promised personal income tax cuts and to get its Budget deficit under control. These are the only possible rationales for the Government's persistence in foisting this tax upon us despite the proximity of the next Federal election and under the circumstances I have described.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that only recently a report published by the Centre of Social and Economic Modelling confirmed much of what the Opposition has been saying about the wholesale sales tax. The report found that the burden of indirect taxes in Australia falls heavily on low income earners. It found that low income families pay an average of $31 per week in existing consumption taxes, which is about eight times what they pay in income tax. Let honourable members opposite try to justify that to their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study also confirmed that compensation for the impact of the coalition's proposed goods and services tax is a relatively straightforward measure. These findings are in addition to the work done by Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, who also found that the Government's changes to the indirect tax system have had a regressive impact on the tax system. In relation to the wholesale sales tax, he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the wholesale sales tax appear to have increased the regressivity of this tax, both through changes to the effective rates of the tax and from changes in other factors.</PARA>
<PARA>The timeframe Dr Warren is talking about is the period since 1984-85&mdash;in other words, the bulk of this Government's time in office. Of course, the big difference between the Government and the Opposition in this matter is that, whereas we propose to compensate people for the price impact of the GST, the Government has not, and will not, provide one cent in compensation for its increases in wholesale sales tax and other indirect taxes during its whole time in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been nearly a 300 per cent increase in sales tax collections since 1983, and there has not been one cent in compensation from the Government for those hardest hit by its taxes. The Government has been engaged in taxation by stealth, since it assumed office in 1983, taking more and more in indirect taxes with no compensation or offsetting tax cuts. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's income tax cuts since 1983 do not even begin to return bracket creep over the same period. It is a tradition, which the Government would undoubtedly continue if it were ever returned to office.

There is obviously no communication between those opposite and their people in the Senate. I probably know why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some very wide-ranging rhetoric in this debate&mdash;as a matter of fact, I thought that we were back on the Appropriations&mdash;which needs to be challenged. Those opposite spoke of the large compliance costs of tax for wholesale sales tax. It is one of the most efficient taxes to collect, because it is collected from very few people. So clearly it is efficient by definition. By whichever definition, a lot of money is collected from a few people. The compliance cost is relatively low, but the compliance costs for the GST will be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems that we will have is the ability of a lot of small businesses to comply, particularly farmers. My guess is that they simply will never comply. The honourable member for Curtin quotes all these various think-tanks supporting his proposition.

I can tell you, Mr Chairman, if the tax accountants think these legislation amendments are going to be a bonanza for them, there is a far greater bonanza awaiting them in the GST.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now considering another 21 amendments, this time to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1992. I have to say that I did inadvertently mislead the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell): the 1,500 pages applied to a package of six Bills which the Government misrepresented as being intended to simplify the 27 pieces of legislation in the wholesale sales tax regime which we debated first in this House in May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We managed to get this Bill referred to a Senate Select Committee, although the Democrats joined the Government in setting an impossibly short time for the inquiry by that Committee. Despite that, of course, the Committee received 150 submissions, all of which were critical of the Bill either in whole or, more often, in specific parts, and particularly in parts which are subject to some of these amendments, some of which do not address those problems that we identified then and that the Committee identified with the help of those 150 submissions. </PARA>

He used to quote figures ad nauseam and then rush down to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to give them all the corrections. People would sit in awe of him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is slowly coming clean. He is right, it was six Bills&mdash;I have it written down here&mdash;but where he continues to be mislead is that it was 200 pages in the whole six Bills. We will eventually drag it out of him. I make this point because this is clearly what we are faced with day by day from the Opposition&mdash;obfuscation and inaccuracies peddled as gospel to us. I must say that I do thank the honourable member for at least coming partially clean, but the fact is there were 200 pages for the whole six Bills, not 1,500 pages for 15 Bills as we started out with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the Budget of this Government, I note that this Budget contains some excellent perspectives. These days I often find that I am quoting myself, because I always seem to make sense, at least to me. I am on record as saying that the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is an excellent Treasurer&mdash;in my view, a better Treasurer than the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If the Prime Minister can refrain from interfering, I believe this Treasurer will go on to bigger and better things. The Treasurer certainly has my full support, and it would be a lot better if the Prime Minister refrained from interfering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to some of the good points in this Budget. This Government, in giving assistance directly to local government&mdash;a point which I have long advocated&mdash;has given local government the potential to do a lot of good in Australia. But that will not necessarily occur unless the money is put to useful purposes. I am afraid there have been some misallocations of funds. This is what one would expect in a budgetary process where there is not much room for consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shire of West Kimberley in my own electorate has had an enormous burden imposed on it by Commonwealth legislation. I refer mainly to some of the ATSIC legislation which has set up Aboriginal communities all over the council area. These communities all need servicing, and have road costs far greater than normal. Consideration should have been given to this issue and money should have been allocated to the West Kimberley shire. There is certainly the unemployment ratio to warrant it. I find it difficult to accept that those communities were overlooked when the Broome area, where a lot of the unemployment is optional, has been very generously funded. I reiterate: unless these councils use this money for productive purposes, the nation may not see its full value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget has some omissions which make me a little disappointed. Firstly, we continue to not fully recognise the plight of rural Australia. When the Whitlam Government brought in its allowance for isolated children&mdash;and this was the first Government in Australia's history to consider this&mdash;there were some 30,000 families in Australia who were eligible for isolated assistance. Today there are 11,000. That in itself tells us what is happening in the bush. The amount of money is so low when spread across the vast area of Australia that it is easy to neglect those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was generous in the last Budget in the unmeans tested component&mdash;a component which I believe should eventually rise to the full average boarding costs in every State. Honourable members should realise that in the city a millionaire's children can walk down the street and receive an education for virtually nothing. That does not occur in the country. Even the poorest have to pay a lot of money to get their kids to the school gate. Many people in country areas cannot afford it and their children do not get the education. We are trying to build a clever country and, when the rural sector is such an important contributor to our foreign earnings, this is not a very clever or equitable way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne and Sydney may rejoice in the welfare payments they are receiving in relation to child-care&mdash;it is costing the Government something like $3.2 billion a year&mdash;and maybe it is deserved, but these isolated people in the country, by definition, will never receive that welfare. If a thin slice of that assistance went towards the caring of these children in the country, it would make an enormous difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When listening to the debate in the House I was reminded that we are indeed representatives of the people. We are in fact a microcosm of the people. Surely the leadership shown here has feet of clay. I was listening to one of the National Party members lamenting, and I was reminded of a meeting of farmers I went to in my electorate in 1984. Honourable members will recall that in 1984 there was a rural crisis in Western Australia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This farmer got up and said, `Look, we want government subsidies; we want the Government to lower the interest rates; we want concessions on freight; we want the Government to reduce the wages; we want the Government to give us cheaper petrol; we want the Government to give us a guaranteed price for wheat; and, above all, we want to get the Government off our backs'. He got a standing ovation. When one listens to some of the debates in this House, one finds we are not so different from those farmers at that gathering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is trumpeting the benefits of the GST. I am fundamentally opposed to the GST. I am fundamentally opposed to all indirect taxes. I believe taxes should be highly visible and painful because this is the only way the community is ever going to keep any restraint on government spending. The reality with the GST is that it will rise incrementally. There will be no protest at the time because it will be imperceptible, but over time it will be an enormous burden and it will undoubtedly contribute to government expenditure. I think that, while it is not practical to have all taxes collected as direct taxes, it is certainly my preferred option. I am honest enough to admit that, if the Opposition were to win the next election and introduce the GST, it is unlikely that we would remove it because we too would fall victim to that easy revenue. That is one of the great threats of the GST. The other problem we have with it is magnified mainly because there are not a lot of people in this Parliament who have ever been in business. When I look at the Opposition side, there seem to be even fewer than on this side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true. Most of those opposite would certainly go broke in business. But one of the things that is not recognised is that poor people spend all their money. The propensity to spend for low income earners is well known. If they spend all their money now, they are going to find it much harder to find the 15 per cent that they must pay on their food. I am reminded of Goebbels when he said, `If you're going to tell a lie, you've got to make it a big lie'. The reason he said that was that he found out some of the vestiges remained. I heard the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) in his discourse talking about the taxes on food and milk. The fact that there are no taxes on these commodities did not seem to confuse or phase him at all. That is part of the Goebbelsian system and this is what is wrong with the situation in Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with Australian industry is not taxation. It was never taxation. It is not really costs. There are far more fundamental problems than that. I have said for many years in this Parliament that the real problem is lack of industry policy. The truth is that there is no real industry policy emanating from either side of this House. We certainly have a better idea than the Opposition, because it has none at all. But even on our side I think it is lacking and unadventurous, and much more can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the honourable members opposite was lamenting the fact that we do not have any downstream processing in this country and that all our minerals are going overseas. He  sounded like our Prime Minister. The problem we have is that most of those minerals go to Asia and Asia does not want processed minerals. Why? Because it wants to do the value adding; it wants to get the jobs that it sees we could get by value adding in this country. As it is the purchaser, we must sell the buyer what it wants, and it does not take value added. Where value added is offered, it puts a tariff on it and, if that does not work, it puts border boundaries on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear people saying that the problem&mdash;and this has come frequently from the Opposition&mdash;is that the industry got sloppy and inefficient because of high tariff protection. Is it not remarkable that in 1959 this country made more motor vehicles and better motor vehicles than Japan? I do not think there is any dispute about that, if one can remember back to 1959. Last year we made something like 380,000 motor vehicles; the Japs made 14 million-odd. The Japanese always had a much more rigorous protection than we did. It was simply impossible to get motor vehicles into Japan. The difference between Japan and Australia was that it owned its industry; we never did. I produced an industry policy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Directions for Growth</EMPHASIS>. It is written by me, and I can recommend it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not yet, but it will be in due course. It sets out several ideas which I think are well worth exploring. It sets out a mechanism for determining what industries are in Australia's interests to pursue. We can do this simply by looking at who owns the industry, who owns the technology and who owns the know-how. That is the important thing. It looks at where the markets are. The table clearly demonstrates which industries fall into that category and which do not. If one is going to have an industry with manufacturing, it is important to know those things. This is not a matter of picking winners, which is the inane comment one hears so often from the Opposition. I might say, to our eternal disgrace in the Labor Party, that we cannot pick winners, the reality is that we are not asked to pick winners; we are merely asked to pick directions for industry. This does not mean we should do away with the industries that exist. Any industry that exists in Australia today and makes a profit by definition is a successful industry and should be retained for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is that it is a social cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for one, do not criticise the French, no matter how unpalatable we find their protection of their agricultural industry. It is in France's interest to do this both in the short and the long term. The French are training and retraining the new generation of farmers so that those farms will eventually disappear. But they have not decided, as we have opted to do in the past, simply to cut these industries off altogether. It was a humane and compassionate method, and it has been used by the Americans and the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were regaled for years by the level playing field&mdash;people on this side and people on the other side. The problem is that there is apparently no-one on the other side, possibly with the exception of the honourable member for Mr Dunkley (Mr Ford), who understands that there is no such thing as a level playing field. Fortunately, on our side there are many who do. Those on our side, who in the past have been advocates of this level playing field, are now being constrained by wiser heads. Therefore, the proposition to the Australian people is quite stark: do they vote for a party that has no idea about the manufacturing industry or do they vote for a party that has some idea? My advice to them is to take some because it is better than none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at industries in Australia, one sees that the great mining industry is very important. Last year, in my home State of Western Australia, five commodities individually earned more than wheat and wool combined. It is by far the most important industry in the powerhouse of the Australian economy, which Western Australia is. Last year Western Australia had something like a $12.7 billion net surplus in foreign earnings. Very little stayed in Western Australia&mdash;most of it either went east or overseas. But it was the Western Australian economy, basically my electorate, that earned that income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us analyse the mining industry. In the year ending 1990-91 we had a full 15 per cent increase in wealth generated from the mining industry. Given that we had commodity downturns in both aluminium and gold, which are very big producers of that wealth, we had to mine a lot more than 15 per cent to achieve that very commendable record. What was the reward for labour out of that? The reward was marginally less employment. The mining industry became even more efficient. We are talking about the most efficient mining industry in the world. It became more efficient and it is going to go on becoming more and more efficient. The next thing to go will be underground trucking jobs. They will be done by automatic methods. This may be a good thing because this is an area in underground mining where accidents occur, but it will mean fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot export the end product because our customers, as I have already explained, do not want value added. What should we do? I think the answer was given very well by Professor Hobbs, whose paper I have appended to my own paper. He points out that $1.6 billion worth of mining equipment is imported into this country every year&mdash;all of which we would either make better or cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the mining industry, better is as good as cheaper. The professor of the Geomechanical Division of the CSIRO has researched this situation thoroughly and he says that we make less of our mining equipment now than we made at the turn of the century. That is an indictment of successive governments in this country. This will not happen overnight and it will not happen just because we have the capacity to make it happen. It will need some direction and some enthusiasm and that must come from governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make many other points in my paper. I point out that government and government agencies are always the biggest customers in any country. That is true whether it is the United States or the old Russia. Government is the biggest customer. If we were to force government&mdash;the public servants&mdash;to consider the real cost of their purchases, the Australian product would come out with flying colours. Invariably it is better made, more easily serviced&mdash;it can be serviced in Australia&mdash;and of course the Government gets all sorts of clawbacks with the purchase of Australian products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply need to develop an ethos change so that, at the end of the day, we will buy the Australian product. That is the sort of ethos they have in Japan, Germany and, to a lesser extent, the United States; but we do not have it here and I would suggest they do not have it in the UK either. But it is something we should change. It does not offend GATT in any way, it does not require any GATT tariff changes and it can make an enormous change to Australian industry virtually overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining to me I want to talk about the Carlton project. This is the project which is capable of transforming the north of Australia. The beef industry in the north of Australia is in chaos&mdash;both in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Beef simply cannot be produced for 85c per kilo, which is about the going price. The price has to go up. The Carlton project was devised by David Bradley who is a vet in Kununurra and the very successful developer of Carlton Hill station. He has probably done more than anyone else in Australia to demonstrate the benefits of leucaena as a cattle-fattening medium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has been busy in Indonesia and he has secured very firm grounds in Indonesia for expanding the Australian cattle industry. Initially, live cattle would be shipped to Indonesia to be slaughtered at a very modern abattoir built by the Belgians some 11 years ago and never used, and later this would be followed by supplementary abattoirs in Australia. He says that in this proposal we take a position in the abattoir so that our growers have part of the benefits of downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also says that because many of the stations in the north of Australia are now Aboriginal-owned, many of them are not producing very well. But wherever one goes, Aboriginal people in the north say that they want to run stations. They want to be the proud station people they once were and they want to run efficient stations. We need the resources at those Aboriginal stations to provide the volume of beef for this enormous market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this will need an input from ATSIC and I believe there should also be input from other sources. The problem will be mobilising ATSIC in the timeframe required. I believe this is impossible and as a result I am looking at other ways of funding it. This is an enormous initiative which the Government should grasp with both hands and foster for all it is worth. It is not a get rich program; it is one which is designed to eke continuing profits over a long time and to enhance the social welfare, well-being and lifestyle of people both in Australia and in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this project to the Prime Minister. I find many of his statements in respect to Asianisation to be rhetoric without substance. Here is one that he can take and run with. It is real and it can deliver benefits to Australia: a workable price for our commodity, participation in the downstream processing, and employment and dignity for Aboriginal people. My time is about to run out and I was going to go on at great length about some other points. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this Budget debate. There can be no doubt that this will be the last Budget brought down by the Keating Labor Government. The Australian public will certainly see to that. It has been nearly a month since this much-criticised Budget was delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and it is already apparent that the Australian public has perceived it to offer no hope for them as they suffer the worst recession in 60 years. In fact, it is the worst recession since we have had social security for all and, in my opinion, it is the worst Budget ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget offers no hope to Australian families, no future for struggling small business, no direction for industry leaders and little comfort to those affected by Labor's mismanagement of the economy over the past nine years. Is it any wonder that this Budget has been seen by nearly all commentators as an abject failure? It has fallen flat in under a month and the only impact it has had on Australians is the fear of the new taxes which this Government refused to acknowledge but was subsequently forced to reveal this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government is intent on providing misinformation to the public, making discreet references to proposed taxes and then shirking it before a forced announcement yesterday. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia cannot trust this Government? The true difference between the Government and the coalition is that we have provided a clear, up-front and honest approach with solutions to rescue the Australian economy. The Labor Party continues with its hidden agenda and government by press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The choice is clear. Australians can choose between a party which is prepared to make the hard decisions and publicise those decisions in detail, as in the Fightback document; or they can gamble on the crisis management approach of the Labor Government. That is a gamble which fewer and fewer Australians are willing to take. This Budget only serves to illustrate that this Keating Labor Government is a bad bet. The Labor Party is a long shot to win an election and an even longer shot to develop any policies which will benefit this country. </PARA>

In every speech on every Bill in this House, Government members have to resort to speaking about the coalition's plans to rebuild the Australian economy. Listening to this Budget debate, it has become clear that some Government members seem to be over-excited in relation to what the general public may think about Fightback. I am reminded at this stage about what the former Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin), said of Fightback. He talked of the enormity of the Fightback policy and how hard it was to comment upon. He said, `I am prepared to concede that it is a comprehensive document'. How right he was and is. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that Government members have used this Budget debate to try to undermine the Fightback policy. Speakers on the Government side are not talking about their own Budget. It is the Fightback package of the Hewson-Fischer coalition which has them in such a froth of excitement. Why will they not come into this chamber and try to defend their own Budget? They do not because they cannot. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) so succinctly put it, this Budget is dead in the water. It was dead in the water almost immediately. Commentators saw this Budget for what it was&mdash;an election bribe&mdash;and it has not worked as the Government had hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government sought to bribe the electorate by resorting to pork-barrelling. It tried to pump millions of taxpayers' dollars into marginal seats in a thinly veiled attempt at job creation. This feeble attempt has been totally discredited straight away. I heard the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) talking about the increase in funding for the local capital works programs in the western suburbs of Sydney.

If one followed the reasoning of the Government, one would assume there is no unemployment in the Sutherland shire, which encompasses the Federal electorates of Cook and Hughes. How wrong such an assumption is. The figures for unemployment in the Sutherland shire are appalling. In the two years to May 1992, unemployment measured by the Caringbah Department of Social Security increased by 294 per cent. In the only other regional DSS office servicing my electorate at Sutherland, the increase in the number of unemployed for the same period was 233 per cent. Try telling the 4,411 people who were receiving unemployment benefits at these two offices in July this year that there is no unemployment in the Sutherland shire. The mistake that the Sutherland shire made is that, of the two Federal members that represent it, one happens to be on the Opposition side and the other one belongs to the wrong faction of the Labor Party, namely, the Left.

It is only the private sector of the economy which provides real jobs. We hear nothing from Government members of the huge advantages small business gets from Fightback. We hear nothing from them about the positive effects Fightback will have on small business not only in the operation of the business but also in the reduced prices of goods they will be able to offer the consuming public.

We now have an almost incredible situation where nearly four million Australians are dependent on some sort of social welfare. I say this with absolutely no disrespect for those people who are receiving this welfare. It is, however, a sad indictment of this Labor Government that this unparalleled rate of welfare dependency has reached such alarming proportions, and so many individuals and families have fallen victim to Labor's economic experiments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in this climate when it is fundamental that we stimulate employment to reduce this rate, the Budget failed. It did nothing to create real jobs. This is in stark contrast to Fightback. To quote my leader once more:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what Fightback is all about: setting a government framework that provides the mechanism whereby the private sector can carry the main task at what it is good at, at what it can do, which is generating wealth and generating jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>This Keating Labor Government would not even begin to understand this. It has no notion about the depth of excellence in small businesses around Australia. This Labor Government is all about imposing regulations and taxes upon them. Fightback will remove these impediments and generate jobs&mdash;real jobs. These are no idle promises or political statements; they are facts, objectives. We have pushed them out for all the world to see. As my leader said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback is the most honest document that has ever been brought into the political process in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Australian public will accept this in a way that Labor Party members have not even considered. We will give individuals greater freedom and control over their own lives. The Labor socialist Government is not even capable of thinking about this process, never mind actually doing anything as politically courageous as introducing a Fightback document&mdash;despite the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who spoke before me, and his comments on the likely direction of the Labor Party to assume a GST themselves in future years. I was pleased to note also that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) saw fit to agree with his statements in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A basic consideration which this Government cannot comprehend is that under our policies a person on average earnings of about $25,000 per year will keep about 86c in every dollar earned in his and, even more importantly, her pocket. At a time when this Budget illustrates Labor's hidden agenda for extra taxes, we have detailed our policies for reduced levels of tax and severe reductions in Government spending across all departments. We used to hear the painful, mournful cry from the Government members as to where we were going to cut our expenses. We have done that, and not a word has come forward from Government members in the intervening time. It is a very fascinating aspect which will be remembered by the public when it gets round to election time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one-off price increase of the GST will be more than offset by the massive reductions in the amount of tax people will have to pay the Government in the form of the seven taxes we will abolish. The coalition will also better target Government payments to people in genuine need, particularly families. To quote the Leader of the Opposition once more, the coalition will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . double family allowances to the low income levels, but as you go up the income scale and you get substantial income tax cuts you should take greater financial responsibility for yourself and your family. You should target it to the needy and make sure that they get more. As you go up the income scale you should make sure that you pull back those benefits so that the people are in a position to take care of the costs of education, health care or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA>This will mean a change in community thinking. I believe that the community is being hurt so much at the present time that it will readily accept this vital difference between the Labor Government and ourselves. We will restore incentive and choice; the Government will continue with big government. That is why this Budget we are talking about is such a failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to Government members speaking in this debate, it is obvious that even they do not have any confidence in this first, and last, Dawkins Budget. They feel the pressure in their own electorates when their constituents realise that this Budget contains nothing in it for them. They know that people are fed up with the tired approach of Labor and are looking for alternatives. The Government members are worried. They are worried because they know that, despite all their promises to blow Fightback out of the water, they have failed&mdash;just as they have failed the people of Australia. Fightback is watertight. It is the document which is setting the agenda in national affairs, not this Budget. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, laughs. He will regret the laughs in the coming weeks and the coming months because what I am saying is true and it is what it will all be about. In fact, of all the Budgets of this Labor Government, including those of the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer, I have not seen one fail so completely and so quickly as this one. To rephrase a well known statement, well may we say `God save the Australian public because nothing will save the Labor Government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few brief comments on this Budget's impact on education and, in particular, its support for non-government schools. I was disappointed in this Budget's complete lack of understanding of the difficulties faced by non-government schools and this Government's continuous mindless pursuit of its new schools policy. More specifically, the decision to continue the freeze on per capita grants to non-government schools in categories 1 to 4 threatens the viability of these schools. Yet again, the Government has shown its disregard for incentive and choice in education, and its ignorance of the plight of non-government schools is a clear testament to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Government obviously do not understand that non-government schools represent a possible saving to taxpayers of some $1.6 billion. Parents willing to commit their own resources to education to choose the type of education for their children will not be overlooked by the coalition. Unlike the Labor Government, we will establish a secure funding formula for funding of non-government schools. This will restore certainty among parents regarding their choice of education for their children&mdash;something which is sadly lacking from this Government. It had the opportunity to do something about this in this Budget, but it failed. It has failed ordinary Australian families yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to non-government schools is unparalleled. In the Fightback policy we have committed ourselves to doubling the annual size of the capital grants program to non-government schools from its 1991 level to $162m a year. That is a commitment of $567m over the six years from 1993 to 2000. We will also lift restrictions which penalise school communities for raising financial support through private effort. This is a scandal in the present education policy. Where, in this Budget, was there any commitment to match this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to funding currently allocated to government schools by States and the Commonwealth, we are committed to a range of policies worth $154m over the rest of the decade to encourage parents' choice of school in the government sector, to lift literacy and language skills and to greatly expand professional development opportunities for teachers. These decisions are in keeping with the coalition's long held belief that parents have a fundamental right of choice of school for their children. Where is the Labor Government's commitment on this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a Liberal-National Party government, every child attending a non-government school will be entitled to a base grant of 20 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. We will reduce the number of levels of schools, but, importantly, no school will lose funds as a result. Quite the contrary. The effect of our policy will be to increase the Commonwealth commitment to per capita funding for non-government school pupils by an additional $1.4 billion over the period to the year 2000 above the present Government's funding commitment. This policy will significantly enhance the right of parental choice of school. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does this Budget compare to these reforms? It is absolutely abysmal by comparison. The role of education cannot be understated in its importance to providing a sound base upon which to build employment opportunities. I would have thought, and indeed hoped, that this Government would have viewed education with a similar view. Unfortunately for the Australian public, it did not. What becomes apparent is that there is very little which is positive in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week we learnt that the tax announcements due to be included with the Budget were withdrawn in an eleventh hour decision by the Prime Minister. The Government has now been forced by this revelation to release these tax details. Once again, it is small business which is to carry the burden. This is yet another bad week for the Labor Government. These are new taxes which Australians will not wear, just as they unilaterally rejected the Budget, and, even more importantly, just as they will reject the Keating Labor Government at the next election. That is the only positive effect of the Dawkins Budget. This Budget has confirmed how ill equipped this Government is at managing the Australian economy and has confirmed without doubt that it is a spent force. This Budget has sounded the death knell for the Keating Government, and it will come none too soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute delight to speak after my good friend the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) after such a brilliant oration. I understand the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was listed to speak next. He is not in the House and, therefore, I will spend a few minutes on my summation of what the honourable member for Cook has rightly said has been the absolute disaster of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with him on many of the points that he raised. One of the saddest things about the Budget debate this year is that the whole thing has developed into a bit of a farce. It is a month since the Budget for 1992-93 was delivered. We effectively had another mini-Budget earlier this week, with the introduction of the new tax schemes. As the honourable member for Cook has rightly said, we now have a situation in which the whole strategy, if there ever was one, of the Government has been shot out of the water. The hope for increased numbers of employment opportunities for Australians has been destroyed because of the tax burden that will fall as a result of this week's announcements, especially on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Australian public is without hope. I think it is fair to say that last year Australians were without hope after the 1991 Budget. I do not think they had much hope in 1990 either. We had some hope, or some indication that there might be some hope, earlier this year with the One Nation statement, but that died in the water as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an Australia that is hurting like it has never hurt before. It is very sad&mdash;and I think every honourable member in the House would have evidence of it in their electorate office&mdash;to see the young Australians, middle-aged Australians and older Australians who come into their office desperate for employment, who realise that they no longer have any hope of getting a job while this Government is in office. The announcements of the new taxation arrangements this week will make it even more difficult for some of those jobs to be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland recently we underwent a major redistribution of our seats. My seat, which extends from within five or six kilometres of the heart of Brisbane to the northern end of the Gold Coast&mdash;a strip about 80 kilometres long by about six kilometres wide at its widest point&mdash;on 1 January this year had registered within it 7,048 small businesses. As part of the process of moving into a new election, I wrote to each small business in my electorate. I was horrified that within a fortnight of that mailing more than 700 of those letters had been returned to sender because those small businesses were no longer there. They had gone. It is very sad to see that the entrepreneurs, the people who have worked hard, who were prepared to work hard and to profit by their hard work, who were prepared to give employment opportunities to Australians, are no longer in the game. Even sadder than that is that they will probably never come back to provide those employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had large areas of blue-collar workers in my electorates over the years. When there is an economic downturn, it is sad to see so many of those people who find themselves out of work. That situation is still there. In my part of the world we are now seeing a lot of people who have been tertiary educated, who have a number of degrees after their names and who are also looking for work, particularly architects, surveyors, geologists, engineers and accountants&mdash;men in their forties who have tried to provide for their young families, who still have children at secondary school and who just do not know how they are going to manage to get their families through. Young families with big mortgages are seeing the prospect of their homes being taken away from them. This is the tragedy of a government that has lost all semblance of caring; a government that it would seem just does not care about what happens out there&mdash;and, even more importantly, does not care about what happens in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had ample evidence in recent weeks of the way this Parliament is treated. We have seen what a farce Question Time has developed into. All we get is tirades of abuse. There are no opportunities to develop the arguments, debates and discussion of what should happen for Australia. I think that is sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today we saw an amazing situation. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) came mincing in here and started singing to the Parliament&mdash;the chorus boys from Cessnock and Cloncurry. They sent up this institution. That makes me very angry, because when the debate degenerates to that standard, this country really has problems. It is all very well to be half smart about these things, but it does our place no good whatsoever and it does this institution no good whatsoever when we see that sort of thing starting to develop in what is supposed to be the major debating chamber of this nation, when we are supposed to be having a debate on what is probably the most important and serious debate of this parliamentary sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of some of the things that have happened and some of the accusations that have been made in recent weeks, we have seen this whole debate develop into high farce in these last few hours. Let us take the situation on fringe benefits taxes. Every day we get a blast about the Opposition's policy towards the motor building industry in Australia. What will those increases in FBT really do?  Did the Government ever do its homework?  Does it realise that 50 per cent of the motor vehicles sold in Australia are in fact business sales; that about 200,000 units last year went to businesses; and that the increased amounts of money that will be allocated from small businesses will mean that fewer and fewer of these vehicles are going to be purchased for business in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear these ridiculous over-the-top arguments from the Government all the time. Yet, by its actions, it seems that it is doing whatever it possibly can to make it almost impossible for small businesses to exist. But this also applies to larger businesses. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gets up in this place and talks about his massive micro-economic reform, how smart he was on the privatisation of Qantas and what a wonderful reform that is. Yet this Government by its very actions is doing everything it possibly can to make sure that we do not get the maximum benefit out of the sale of the merged Australian Airlines and Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the fringe benefits tax. Qantas came to me the other day. It has done a study on Kingsford-Smith airport alone. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested in this: the cost of that fringe benefits tax to be able to provide parking for its staff will add $8m a year to the bottom line of Qantas. This Government is so money hungry that it has had the Australian Taxation Office go through the place in recent times to do a reassessment of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real classics is the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax that has now been imposed on the new Qantas simulators; machines which teach the pilots how to fly particular aircraft. It is not a money raising operation for Qantas, although it could be if it was done properly. It should be treated as an educational tool. But, no, the Government says to the Taxation Office, `Go out and get the money; screw down whoever you can'&mdash;and so it goes to Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those two examples alone, Qantas has about $18m off its bottom line. If one is trying to gear up a government outfit for the maximum return on privatisation, one starts doing things like that. One of the side effects of the imposition of that 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on simulators is simply that the Malaysians, who were very interested in hiring the Qantas equipment to teach their pilots how to fly, now are not coming here. This would have been good export dollars for Australia. How smart this Government is! What an intellectual giant our Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is when we get situations where we are physically taking away the hard dollars that we so desperately need in this country!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have people coming in here, like the honourable member for Hunter this afternoon, carrying on like a half shut penknife, singing to the chamber and talking about the situation in the tourist industry and how the Fightback package is going to wreck it. But did he ever sit down and think about the real implications of Fightback for Australia and for his particular electorate of Cessnock?  The honourable member says that the abolition of the fuel excise is going to make no difference; nobody is going to travel even though fuel will be 19c a litre cheaper and the average income earner will have $1,200 to $3,000 more in his pocket. Members of the Government do not think these things through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in these final months of this disastrous Government our debate in this House needs to be more and more tailored to making a close examination of how we are going to save this particular nation; how we are going to get it out of the depths; how we are going to provide the work opportunities for the young people; and how we are going to make sure that our education system works. It is all very well talking about how many tertiary places we provide. But, as I evidenced a little while ago, so many people who have been through our tertiary institutions go out and find that there are no jobs for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House another example of what happened in Brisbane recently. This is another airline story. I suppose because of one's portfolio connections one gets these stories. One of the major airlines wanted a filing clerk with year 11 standard. A very tiny ad was placed in one of the newspapers and 270 applications were received. Of those 270 applications for a job requiring year 11 qualifications, 92 held Bachelor of Arts degrees. The last time I checked the figures, it cost Australian taxpayers about $32,000 to put somebody through the University of Queensland so that they would emerge with a Bachelor of Arts degree. What do we do?  We fill the jobs that a young kid could have constructively gone out and got. But no, we blew that one too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This place really has to pull itself together, take a grip of the situation and start being a little bit realistic about what we are here for; what this institution is all about. This institution is all about the real welfare of the people of Australia. Quite frankly, with the standard of debate we have had here in the last four or five weeks we should be ashamed of ourselves. We have had no constructive debate from the Government; we have had nothing but tirades of abuse; we have had nothing but exaggeration; and we have had nothing but downright lies in many cases. It is all very smart; it is all very political; it is all great fun; the press gallery has an absolute field day with it; but at the end of the day we are not doing the job by real Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be looking right now at what we are going to do over these closing months. Now is the time for us to do a stocktake of what is really needed in Australia. Hopefully we can sit down with level heads and cool minds to make sure that the contribution we make is a constructive one so that we have an opportunity out there of being able to provide jobs for our kids. How many of those kids who are going to come out of year 12 in the next couple of months will try to get into university but will not be able to?  How many of the kids coming out of year 12 have already repeated the year once&mdash;and in one of the high schools in my electorate twice because this is the third go at year 12? And we think it is smart to play politics in here!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry but I just think the standard of debate we have seen from the Government in recent weeks is a disgrace. I just hope that we are starting to get a change of attitude in this place because if we do not this place is going to be regarded in lower and lower esteem than it ever has been in the past.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the real tragedy. But at the end of the day the tragedy is not about the people in this place; it is about the denigration of this institution and, most importantly, it is about the effects on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>

Specifically, I wish to focus on the areas of social security and health. Social justice is about the quality of life. It is about recognising the differences which exist in society and implementing policies and programs which will ensure a fairer and more prosperous society. The Government is rightly proud of the reforms achieved in social security and health over the last decade. This Budget continues the Government's policy of targeting resources to those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to the Opposition, this Budget addresses the needs of all sections of the community. It is a Budget which puts people first. In an interview with Kerry O'Brien on ABC Television's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 9 September, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proudly boasted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback! is unashamedly pro-business. The benefits are unashamedly directed to the business community.</PARA>
<PARA>It sums up pretty well what he and his supporters believe in, and should sound a warning to all Australians regarding the Opposition's policy priorities should it ever win government. When it comes to caring and compassionate policies, the Opposition has none because a computer model does not understand such concepts. Yet the Leader of the Opposition seems to justify everything he says by saying it has been computer modelled. It is time the Leader of the Opposition realised that the real world does not conform to economic textbooks and computer models. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interview with Phillip Clark on ABC radio on 15 September, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) described the Leader of the Opposition as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only person who could make Andrew Peacock look deep; John Howard look visionary and Paul Keating look humble.</PARA>
<PARA>Fightback is a setback for most Australians, with even business leaders questioning its supposed benefits. With economic recovery much slower than anybody expected, it is important that those affected by the recession are provided with assistance. While the Government's main priorities are job creation and education and training programs, we also recognise the need to provide assistance for those people in receipt of social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is a serious problem, and for the individuals concerned and their families the effects can be quite traumatic. The Budget provides more than $102m over the next three years for Jobstart wage subsidies of between $105 and $230 a week to help an additional 33,000 long term unemployed adults gain work experience and skills. Skillshare will receive $73m over the next two years to provide training and employment skills for the long term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. The Jobskills program will be expanded to provide opportunities for an additional 6,000 long term unemployed adults to gain work experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are only some of the measures contained in the Budget which deal with the long term unemployed. Rather than try to assist the long term unemployed, the Opposition seems intent on punishing them. How else could we explain a policy which seeks to cut people's benefits after nine months? It is a return to the dark years of the Fraser Government and the myth of the dole bludger. Page 275 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> makes quite clear the Opposition's position on welfare when it arrogantly asserts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is need for more of the responsibility for individual welfare to be shifted from the government to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition would have us believe that the only reason people are unemployed for more than nine months was because they are not really looking for work. The Opposition believes there are jobs out there, if only a person will make proper efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By cutting off the Job Search allowance after nine months, the Opposition believes it will be `encouraging greater self-reliance'. What this ill-conceived and punitive policy will encourage is a greater incidence of crime, as people need to feed and clothe themselves. This is the vision for the future of the Leader of the Opposition, his blueprint for recovery: punish the unemployed and create a permanent underclass. Indeed, the unemployed are crucial to the success of Fightback, as it is they who will fund the tax cuts promised by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the unemployed who will be punished by Fightback, but all people in receipt of social security benefits including pensioners, veterans, people with disabilities, carers and those in receipt of family allowance, to name just a few. With the abolition of wholesale sales tax, petroleum tax, payroll tax, lump sum superannuation tax, the training guarantee levy, customs duty, coal export duty and capital gains tax, government services will have to be slashed under a coalition government, even allowing for revenue raised from the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a coalition government, social security expenditure will be cut by 7.5 per cent or $2.4 billion. These cuts include reducing rates for unemployed people under 21; increasing the pension age for women to 65 years; cutting people off the Job Search and Newstart allowance; cutting people off sickness allowance and disability support pensions; increasing the minimum waiting time for unemployed and sick people from one week to three weeks; and abolishing wives pension for disability pensioners under 50 years of age. Only a person so far removed from reality could argue that it is fair and equitable to cut a person's unemployment benefit after nine months while, at the same time, giving a 14.5 per cent tax cut to a person earning $75,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is already the third lowest taxing and spending OECD country, yet the Leader of the Opposition wants to slash government spending even further. More importantly, his planned tax cuts come from those areas which affect the most disadvantaged sections of the community. While the Opposition seems intent on punishing those in receipt of social security benefits and destroying the social fabric of Australian society, the Government is committed to improving the living and working conditions of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Government's commitment to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, all pensioners will receive an extra $6 a fortnight, single, and $10 a fortnight for couples. In addition to this, from April 1993, all part-pensioners will be eligible for fringe benefits concessions. These reforms, coupled with the Government's previous reforms such as automatic indexation of pensions in line with the CPI, deeming of pensioner savings accounts, indexation of the pensioner tax free threshold and indexation of non-pension income, will all guarantee that pensioners can retire and live in dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased assistance for private renters will also ensure that the Government's social justice objectives are realised. For March 1993 the maximum rate of rent assistance will increase to $66.90 a fortnight, an increase of $16.90 a fortnight. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition who believes that all renters are lazy and have no pride in their homes, the Government recognises the needs of this section of the community and is targeting resources to those most in need. Rather than simply abusing renters, the Government recognises that for many people renting is their only option. Under this Government, rent assistance for those people greatest in need has risen by 80 per cent for couples and singles without children, and 140 per cent for parents with three or more children. Renters are not second-class citizens, as the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important platform in the Government's social justice agenda is the provision and maintenance of the universal health care system. The $1.6 billion to be spent on our health system over the next six years will ensure that all Australians have access to quality health coverage. Unlike the Opposition, the Government is committed to maintaining Medicare and not forcing people into private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is quick to say that the Opposition will not abolish Medicare. Yet the Opposition's own literature indicates the exact opposite. In its pamphlet promoting Fightback, the Opposition claims that pensioners will be better off. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax credits for private health cover&mdash;extra tax credits if you are over 65. (Every pensioner will be able to be covered by free private health cover if they so desire.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare stays. Better access to health care.</PARA>
<PARA>Why would pensioners need tax credits if they are to receive free private health cover? Tax credits would only be of benefit to a person who was actually paying for private health insurance. Furthermore, why would not every pensioner take up the option of free private health cover? I would also be interested to know which private health insurers are willing to provide free cover to pensioners. The simple truth is that the Opposition has no commitment whatever to Medicare and will force everyone into private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback intends reducing Medicare benefits by $1.5 billion, yet the Leader of the Opposition has the audacity to parade around the country and tell the people of Australia that he is committed to maintaining Medicare. All the Opposition's talk of providing people with choice is nothing more than hollow rhetoric. It will allow Medicare to run down to such an extent that it will, at best, be a second-class health system servicing those people too poor to have private health insurance. The Opposition's policies, as outlined in Fightback, will do nothing to promote equality in our society. If anything, they will only polarise existing divisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's future is not worth risking in the hands of a computer modelling academic, driven by his obsession with imposing economic theory over the needs of people. The Leader of the Opposition needs to spend less time working the big boardroom circuit and more time actually listening to people&mdash;and not dismissing them as irrelevant if they dare disagree with his opinions. It is very interesting to again quote what the Leader of the Opposition had to say to Kerry O'Brien on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program. He said:</PARA>

Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should even listen to his backbenchers who can see the writing on the wall and their collective downfall in their Leader's obsession with Fightback.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A great deal of this Appropriation debate has centred on the virtues of Fightback and One Nation. Most of that debate has been totally partisan and negative, and each package has been presented as if no other options existed. The differences have been magnified, and the whole debate has exhibited the worst features of adversary politics. All I can say&mdash;after listening to the litany of accusations and insults, of charges of lies and distortions, from the Government to the Opposition and vice versa&mdash;is that to a fair degree both sides are correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking an independent view of these two packages, it is increasingly obvious to me that the similarity of the two packages outweighs the differences. Both packages offer regressive tax cuts funded by bracket creep. Both offer a real decline in government expenditure. Both are founded explicitly and implicitly on three fundamental myths: Australia is a high taxing country and, therefore, we have to reduce taxation; there is too much money spent in the public sector, and we have to reduce that; and there is too much money spent on welfare, and we have to reduce that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that Australia is among the lowest taxed countries in the OECD group. It also has the lowest expenditure in the public sector. To use the words of a very hardline political commentator, Max Walsh, Australia runs the leanest and meanest welfare system of any comparable country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there is a massive over-staffing and inefficiency in our public sector is more a function of the nineteenth century political arrangements in Australia, with nine governments and a whole host of associated bureaucracies. But none of that is addressed in either package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, when I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) say that what Fightback will give this country is a Hong Kong tax system, I must admit it struck fear into me&mdash;and it should do into every Australian. What those opposite are really talking about is a 15 per cent income tax, no capital gains tax, no tax on interest, and cutting the expenditure in the public sector by more than half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, what they are saying is that we would have a Hong Kong pension system&mdash;$70 a month; a Hong Kong education system, where they would spend one-half of what we spend on education; and a Hong Kong health system. It is fairly frightening to think that a responsible Leader of the Opposition could stand up and compare the public infrastructure requirements of an island state such as Hong Kong with a country the size of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that both parties are never going to give up using tax policy as a bribe for strategic voting groups for election. One Nation largely matches Fightback in its tax cuts but, of course, gives nothing to income groups below $20,000, and does not give anything to income groups above $50,000. I suppose those opposite think that those above $50,000 will vote Liberal anyway, and that those below $20,000 have nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback offers slightly more substantial cuts to people on incomes above $45,000 and some cuts to those with incomes below $35,000. But all those below $35,000 are net losers because they are hit to leg by the GST and also the expenditure cuts. In the competition to offer tax cuts to the middle income group, which are not finally delivered until 1996, whoever is in government will lock itself into a very restrictive fiscal policy. The public has little faith in such commitments, dependent as it is on the economy reacting in the way that is predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the evidence of the last few years, there is no guarantee that in two or three years we will have any control over the economy. Even if the predicted growth rates are achieved, there is a heavy risk that we will see a blow-out in imports. Ross Garnaut stated recently that not only do both packages contain risks to international competitiveness but also the bidding war on tax cuts could damage future economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since World War II, Australia has run the fastest rate of population growth in the industrialised world. At the same time, we have had a steady reduction in the real rate of infrastructure spending. The result today is an orgy of asset selling, privatisation, a reduction of public services and a steady deterioration of physical infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. Both packages do little to reverse those trends. One Nation pays lip service to infrastructure needs by deficit spending, which can only be short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is largely correct in his complaint about government hypocrisy and the exaggeration of the two positions on tariffs. It is equally true that the Government's expansion of regressive taxes since 1983 is really only arriving at a value added tax by a slower method than the big bang method of the Opposition. But there are degrees of difference, and they certainly count. The fact is that the Opposition's Fightback policy is an honest, if not blatant, commitment to economic rationalism. The Government's One Nation policy is a slower and more conservative approach to the same ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback and One Nation involve essentially the redistribution of incomes. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that neither will do anything other than have a marginal effect on Australia's economic problems or unemployment; both envisage high unemployment into the long term future. Nevertheless, Fightback is the larger and more radical program. Centred on the GST, which will affect every Australian, it deserves closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no partisan axe to grind in this debate, but there are many questions about the GST that the Opposition has not yet satisfactorily resolved. Many papers and reports purport to model the GST. There have been countless claims from both sides about percentage increases, dollars per week and gains and losses on all manner of groups and prices of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truth we all know is that it is impossible to accurately model or predict the GST, given the fact that no-one can predict the state of the economy when it will be introduced. No-one can predict how organisations and individuals will react to its introduction in an uncertain climate for prices and administrative costs and with the pressure for higher wages. The unions will not stand still, even if we ever achieve 4.4 per cent inflation. Quite frankly, I do not believe that that will be possible for a whole range of reasons, which I will come to later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a way, it is a situation analogous to when metric conversion was introduced into this country. It should not have had any effect on the prices of buildings, but I lived through it at very close quarters. Over a period of 18 months, the price of buildings virtually doubled. A range of reasons&mdash;mainly uncertainties that it created in the whole industry&mdash;were responsible for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attempts to predict inflation with certainty are quite childish. They even ignore international factors, which cannot be ignored, and whether savings to business will really be passed on. They also ignore the union reaction and the fact that many manufacturers will take the opportunity to make price rises in the shake-out.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From evidence overseas, the rise in administrative costs is also fairly unpredictable, as we move from 70,000 indirect taxpayers to somewhere&mdash;there are various arguments&mdash;between one million and 1.3 million indirect taxpayers. All these things indicate a surge in inflation well above the predicted models of both the Opposition and the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition claim about lifting $20 billion off the backs of business has occurred virtually 10 times a day, yet it still claims only 4.4 per cent inflation. Quite frankly, it seems to me that this is a claim worthy of Dr Goebbels because, unless business passes back every dollar of the $20 billion saving, inflation will not be 4.4 per cent. If it only passes half of it back there will be 10 per cent inflation, and if it passes none of the $20 billion saving back, inflation will be 15 per cent. Fightback says the $20 billion saving will be used to increase profits and create more employment, but if it is not passed back the inflation figures go out the window. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents make great play of the fact that the effect of the 15 per cent GST will be countered by the removal of seven other taxes: the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, Customs duties, the training guarantee levy, the coal export levy and the superannuation lump sum. These are the seven taxes that will be removed. But when one starts to really look at those seven taxes, one sees that the coal export duty of course has already been removed and the superannuation levy, the training guarantee levy and the Customs excises are relatively minor in the whole thing. How much of the wholesale sales tax will come back is very much open to doubt, and I do not think anyone in all conscience can predict that. There will be a whole range of factors why people will take the opportunity not to pass back all those savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we have heard it here, that the friends and relatives of everyone on the Opposition side have only bought stuff at supermarkets that has 30 per cent sales tax on it and that everyone on the Government side only buys things at supermarkets that do not have any wholesale sales tax on them. But the fact is that when the wholesale sales tax is removed and a 15 per cent GST is added, the new retail price will rarely be reduced; it will be increased in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the GST involves significant increases in indirect personal tax, particularly for those with high ratios of consumption to income&mdash;that is, low income groups and families. Expenditure on food, which is presently untaxed, expressed as a percentage of income, is in fact three times as high for the poor as for the rich. In fact they will be taxed three times as much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the equation on who benefits is that the biggest tax reductions are, of course, in luxury motor cars, with tax exempt status for private school fees, private health care and overseas holidays. There is little doubt that the GST redistributes tax and increases the burden on the young and the old and reduces it on the middle-aged. The compensation packages are inadequate, particularly given the likely inflation rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback assumes that the wholesale sales tax savings will be passed on, that company tax will be absorbed and that half of payroll tax will be passed on. If we work all this out according to the economic studies, the net reduction to business is only $800m, and even this is probably an overestimate. It includes $1.2 billion of revenue from taxation of foreign tourists and the black economy, and even if the Opposition is only half right on that, then the net reduction on business falls to a trivial $200m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone has made great play of the removal of payroll tax. But everyone seems to have forgotten that payroll tax is a State tax. I can assure honourable members that State governments will not just accept the removal of payroll tax for what they collected this year because it would mean cutting off their options for the future. They will demand a lot more in compensation or, alternatively, they will simply bring in a new tax to create a new source of revenue for themselves. It is really interesting that the Opposition side of the House is doing this. It is very much a centralist move to remove the States' ability to raise funds for themselves.  As I see it, the real problem with the GST is in the fuel tax question. Much has been made of the removal of transport costs by removing the $6.6 billion fuel excise but again if this is not passed on to consumers inflation must increase. There is no other way; we cannot have it both ways. Similarly, if road user charges are not imposed in the same amount then there will be a $6 billion blow-out in the Budget. Even if road user charges are imposed, there are no savings to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third big problem with the fuel tax over and above all of these taxes is the argument, if we accept the Opposition's statements on face value, that there will be a massive reduction in costs to truck owners and private bus owners, reduced fuel costs to motorists and a reduction in the price of petrol of about 30 per cent for the public and 39 per cent for business. At the same time, public transport fares will be increased by 15 per cent. Given the removal of the other taxes, perhaps that will go up only 8 per cent or 9 per cent. Nevertheless, there will be an increase in public transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the most irresponsible action I could ever think of. The absence of a level playing field between public and private transport funding has already resulted in a major distortion of land use and transport systems throughout the country. Australian petrol is the second cheapest in the world. That is the reason that we have such a terrible road system in this country. Europe has always run double and triple the fuel tax of Australia and put it into roads and public transport. We can see the results in Europe today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposal to reduce transport costs for private cars and trucks and increase public transport costs will cause a massive shift to private transport. In the urban areas this will result in accelerated urban sprawl. It will result in massive traffic congestion, more parking frustration, air and noise pollution, pedestrian difficulties and devaluation of property in the cities. In the rural areas there will be an increase in truck and bus accidents and there will be a major shift of transport of goods and people from rail to road. If this ever happened, there would be no reason to spend a single cent on rail ever again. We can forget passenger rail totally throughout Australia. Anything that is spent there will simply be a waste of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road deterioration and maintenance will increase. Of course, the cost of new construction of roads will increase. There is nowhere in the Fightback budget to allow for that increase in the construction of roads which will be caused by the increased volumes of motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oil consumption and price are directly related. So even if we did achieve these reductions in fuel costs Australia's fuel consumption would increase dramatically, our imports would escalate and our balance of payments made worse. We are facing a crisis in oil over the next decade. If we did this, the balance of payments would go through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of all, I object to the fuel tax proposal because the big problem with the motor car in Australia's urban areas is the fact that there is no relation of cost to usage. The cost of cars is very high because they are so heavily taxed, but the usage is subsidised because fuel is relatively cheap. This further breaks that nexus between costs and usage. I see it as a mindless election bribe and a formula for transport and land use anarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the advantages of the abolition of the seven taxes when we really look at them have very little value. What is certain is the 15 per cent GST. But the benefits of the removal of these seven taxes are really very rubbery and very speculative. It is a case in my book of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</EMPHASIS> Just as Fightback redistributes tax from rich to poor, it also redistributes tax from big business to small business. The abolition of payroll tax does not save small business a cent. The vast majority are certainly below the payroll tax threshold. But we get an increase in company tax and the administrative cost, all of which go on to small business. They will get very little help from the elimination of the seven dwarfs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback also hinges on the achievement of a $10 billion cut in expenditure. In the last 50 years, how many times have people heard governments talk about cuts in expenditure? I have no doubt that it will achieve cuts in expenditure in certain areas, but it will get blow-outs in other areas, particularly in roads and health. I do not believe that these cuts will really happen. Even if they did, public expenditure cuts will impinge on lower income groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the privatisation program is highly speculative. Large scale asset selling rarely achieves its financial objectives. That is what the Greiner Government found out in New South Wales, because it is simply not possible to sell a huge amount of assets in a short time. The package also ignores the loss of public income from some of the assets that we sell, such as Telecom, the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Income is reduced and nowhere is that made up. At the very best, it is a short term solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Fahey Government has produced a very good Budget. However, it was founded on the sale of the GIO. It has been indicated that next year's Budget will be founded on the sale of the State Bank. But what will the Budget after that be founded on? With asset selling, we are basically living off the good work of our predecessors, trying to make up for the mistakes of the present and leaving nothing for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package also relies on substantial gains in revenue from the black economy. The evidence from other countries is that those gains are not there. In fact, everyone now has a 15 per cent incentive to go further into the black economy. Contrary to what most people think, the tax file system in 1985 pulled in a lot of the people totally outside the tax system. The black economy today basically consists of people who declare all their deductions to the Taxation Office and then make cash transactions. They now have a 15 per cent incentive to go into more cash transactions and bartering systems. Unless the Opposition provides better answers than it has done already, the Fightback package and the GST have all the potential to be what the business writer Austin Donnelly has dubbed a nightmare that Australia must avoid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Government buyers are required to follow the Government's Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) Supplies Policy. The policy is set out in detail in Commonwealth Procurement Guideline No 12 which was tabled in the Senate on 18 December 1990 and in this House on 20 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy is concerned with giving ANZ suppliers full and fair opportunity to compete for Government business, where procurement decisions are made on the basis of value for money. The policy has a number of features:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government buyers are required to actively seek out ANZ suppliers and give them the opportunity to bid for Government business;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">buyers are not to discriminate against ANZ suppliers on any basis. Particular emphasis is placed on using functional specifications rather than restrictive technical specifications such as can only be met by imported products. This obligation ensures that suppliers are placed in an environment of effective competition;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">buyers are required to consider the advantages that ANZ suppliers can offer the Government in the areas of quality, delivery, service, response times and whole-of-life costs. This value for money assessment is the cornerstone of Commonwealth procurement. Lowest price is not the deciding factor in procurement decisions; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">suppliers are entitled to be debriefed when the selection is finalised. This helps unsuccessful suppliers to understand where they may need to improve so that they will be able to submit a more competitive bid next time, and assists them to a better understanding of buyer requirements and the procurement process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is promoting the procurement of value for money ANZ supplies in a variety of ways:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by developing a Guide to Government Purchasing which will help ANZ suppliers sell to the Government. The Guide will provide information about what individual Departments and Agencies buy and how they do their buying. It will also provide a comprehensive listing of relevant procurement staff in Departments and Agencies for suppliers to contact;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by running "Meet the Buyers" reverse trade fairs in Canberra, where suppliers have the opportunity to discover the range of goods and services purchased by the Government, deal face to face with Government buyers and more effectively and directly market their supplies;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by participating in Meet the Buyers events run by State Governments in various State capitals; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by managing a series of seminars for public sector executives on how to achieve better value for money purchasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These activities are supported by other Government initiatives such as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">funding, through the Advance Australia Foundation, the Australian Made campaign which is designed to promote quality Australian made products; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the joint funding, with the States, of the operations of the Industrial Supplies Office which provides a highly successful import replacement service actively promoted to Government buyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government's ANZ Supplies Policy defines ANZ suppliers as those whose goods and services are produced wholly or partly in Australia and/or New Zealand. The policy does not have a focus on comparative levels of local content but on the provision of competitive opportunities for local suppliers in the Government and on the use of value for money local supplies. The policy does not involve service-wide collection of data on ANZ purchases. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Representations on the matter were made to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training by a Dr Neil Flanagan, John Flanagan's father, on 5 July 1992. A response to that representation was provided on 13 August 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, federal and State industrial relations systems in Australia and Governments at both levels offer award enquiry and complaint investigation services which cover their respective jurisdictions. In this instance, as John Flanagan was employed under a State Award, Dr Flanagan's letter was forwarded to the Queensland Department of Employment, Vocational Education, Training and Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Federal awards and agreements stipulate minimum rates of pay and conditions of service which employers must provide to employees, including the young. The Awards Management Branch of the Department of Industrial Relations provides the services I have already described to individuals and groups, including the young, to secure the observance of federal awards and agreements. The Awards Management Branch also provides an education service, involving communication and training, to systematically raise people's awareness of award/agreement obligations and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also established Industrial Relations Education Committees in each State to assist in educating students on the award system and entitlements before they enter the workforce. State Governments also participate in these Committees and also offer similar services to cover employees of State awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. Statistics kept by the Awards Management Branch of the federal Department of Industrial Relations on complaints taken from employees concerning alleged breaches of award/agreement entitlements and obligations are not broken down into age groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. In the federal arena, legal proceedings may be instituted against employers where they have not voluntarily complied with advice from Awards Management Officers to rectify award/agreement breaches. In such cases, prosecution is taken under provisions of the Federal Industrial Relations Act 1988. Legal proceedings are however a last resort and are only contemplated when voluntary compliance cannot be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1-4) The National Health and Medical Research Council is currently considering a draft Code of Practice for the near-surface disposal of radioactive waste in Australia. The purpose of the Code is to provide a basis for the near-surface disposal of solid radioactive waste that falls within certain limits of activity concentrations or radiotoxicity such that there is no unacceptable risk or detriment to humans, other biota or the environment, at present, and that future risks or detriment will not exceed those currently accepted. The issues relating to the actual establishment of waste repositories raised in the honourable member's question are matters for the State and Territory authorities concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The draft Code of Practice sets out a number of site selection criteria. These include that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`the water table in the area should be at a sufficient depth below the planned disposal structures to ensure that groundwater is unlikely to rise to within 5 metres of the waste and the hydrogeological setting should be such that large fluctuations in the water table are unlikely'; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The draft Code of Practice requires that a site `shall have characteristics that will facilitate the long term stability of the facility and provide adequate isolation of the waste so that the objective (of no unacceptable detriment to other biota and the environment) is achieved'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b-c) The judgement of the requirements for the site selection criteria in the draft Code of Practice is based upon the site being subject to an institu</PARA>
