<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Otherwise they are okay, yes. They are extreme words, but nonetheless they reflect the unfortunate cases which occur each week in my office in Toowoomba. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said it all last evening when he summed it up by saying that the Child Support Agency has to lift its game. There is no doubt about it: the Child Support Agency has to lift its game. To be fair, not all of the problems are of its own making. We in the Opposition generally see it as an appropriate concept, and this legislation before us is a step in the right direction as, indeed, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) mentioned last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think there is a need to put these criticisms and reservations in their proper perspective and ask the basic question, `What did we have previously? What were the arrangements we had in this country previously?'. I think it is appropriate that this morning we should briefly run over the historical summary of the lead-up to the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of the child support scheme in June 1988, child support was regulated under part VIII of the Family Law Act 1975. Both child support and spouse maintenance were governed by the same legal framework. There was a primary obligation imposed upon parents to maintain their children according to their children's needs and their own respective financial resources. However, this obligation had no practical significance on its own. The only way for a custodial parent to obtain child support from the non-custodial parent was by way of a court order. In order to obtain a court order the custodial parent was required to complete and submit a lengthy application to either the Family Court or the Magistrates Court. Even if the parents agreed upon the terms and conditions of child support, the agreement was unenforceable unless it was registered by the court, again requiring an application to the Family Court or Magistrates Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having therefore toiled through the protracted application procedure, the custodial parent was then subjected to the unpredictability of the courts. In determining whether or not to grant an application and on what terms, the court was required to have regard only to the list of 17 considerations in sections 74 to 76 of the Family Law Act, including the needs of the child, the respective financial resources of each parent and any other fact which, in the opinion of the court, was relevant in the interests of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last consideration, together with an absence of legislative guidance as to the relative weightings of the 17 factors, effectively gave the courts unlimited discretion. The resulting unpredictability meant that parents had no reliable basis upon which to build maintenance agreements. More significantly, the lack of certainty operated to discourage custodians from seeking child support at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even once a court order was successfully obtained, the custodial parent would receive child support money only if the non-custodial parent complied with his or her obligations under the order. If maintenance was not paid, the court would not automatically enforce the order. The custodial parent was required to take enforcement action himself or herself. This again involved further applications, service of documents and undoubted litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expense, time and difficulties associated with the process of obtaining child support under the Family Law Act were severe disincentives to custodial parents. Not surprisingly, many custodians did not try to secure maintenance from the parent who should have been paying it. Often, custodians relied on pension payments instead. The result was that many children lived in families with less income than they would have had if a parent paid proper child support. It also meant that taxpayers&mdash;this is an important point&mdash;paid to support children when parents should have done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act recommended the creation of a maintenance collection and enforcement agency. This recommendation was endorsed by the report of the national maintenance inquiry of 1984 which made detailed recommendations for the creation of a national maintenance agency. Indeed, a report by the inquiry demonstrated the woefully inadequate orders and arrangements being made in respect of child maintenance and that compliance levels were generally low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies also revealed a disproportionate level of poverty among single supporting parents, who were almost universally female. These studies, together with a very large blow-out in social security payments to supporting parents in the past decade, eventually led to the new child support system which, in part, is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 a ministerial committee was set up to develop government policy in this area. On 19 August 1986 the then Minister for Social Security&mdash;the present Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe)&mdash;announced the Government's intention to undertake a major reform of the child support and maintenance system in Australia. This announcement set out the basic direction for reform. The Government proposed to introduce a system of formula based assessment of maintenance administered by the Child Support Agency attached to the Taxation Office. The collection of maintenance was to be through the withholding of payments at point of payment of wage or salary, wherever possible. On 8 October 1986 a discussion paper on the Government's proposals for reform was released and submissions from interested parties were invited. The community consultation which followed revealed considerable support for the reform proposals. On 24 March 1987 a firm policy in the area was announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's objectives were fivefold: firstly, that non-custodial parents should share the cost of their children according to their capacity to pay; secondly, that adequate support be available for all children of separated parents; thirdly, that Commonwealth expenditure be limited to what is necessary to ensure that those needs be met; fourthly, to ensure that neither parent is discouraged from participating in the work force; and, finally, that the overall arrangements should be simple, should be flexible, should be efficient and, not least of all, should respect personal privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time a two-stage implementation was announced. Stage one, involving registration and collection by the Child Support Agency, came into effect on 1 June 1988 and sought to redress the enforcement problems associated with existing child maintenance orders and agreements. The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 established an administrative body within the Australian Taxation Office called the Child Support Agency where child maintenance orders and agreements could be registered. The CSA was to become solely responsible for enforcement of orders and agreements, collection of child maintenance and payment to the custodians. Since the CSA is part of the Taxation Office it may, in appropriate cases, also order the non-custodian's employer to deduct the amount payable from the non-custodian's wages. Stage two involved the administrative assessment by a formula. Stage two came into effect on 1 October 1989 and sought to provide a cheaper, simpler and faster means of application for and determination of child support in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 enables custodial parents in appropriate circumstances to obtain child support simply by submitting an application form to the CSA. No litigation is involved. The CSA then determines the quantity of child support payable on the basis of a mathematical formula set out in the Act. I will come back to that formula in a moment. Collection, enforcement and payment are carried out by the CSA pursuant to that Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, as in the stage one cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrative assessment of child support under stage two is limited in coverage so that it has progressive application only. Under part III  and part IV  of  that  Child  Support  (Assessment) Act, administrative assessment is available only in relation to certain children, by certain applicants and from certain respondents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the comments from the constituent officer in my electorate office that I started off with. Yesterday I asked her to make a few remarks about the Child Support Agency. This is what she said, in part: firstly, non-payment of maintenance is still the main problem; secondly, there are long delays in the first payment of maintenance. She exemplified the point with a case where the payer owed between $12,000 and $15,000 in arrears of maintenance. It took approximately two years for this case to come to the notice of the Child Support Agency and then the payer said that he was unemployed and applied to the CSA for a variance of the order. This was granted and the arrears were waived. The payee ended up with nothing from the payer but simply a supporting parent's pension. It is fair to say that, due to the lack of staff within the agency, cases take a very long time to chase up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the agency there is a Child Support Agency forum. This is run from the legal aid office in each capital city, as I understand it. The forum head in Brisbane has informed my constituent officer that at present she has no more funds for this year. The forum has 1,500 cases to examine and there are approximately three lawyers to do the work. She has applied for more staff, but if she gets them she has no accommodation for them to work in. So although this forum was set up to relieve the load on the agency, it seems that it has not been given proper funding, and that in itself poses a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the specifics of these changes which are before us today. I refer specifically to the administrative review process. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill will undoubtedly allow a custodian or a liable parent to have an assessment of child support reviewed by an independent person free of charge and without legal representation, by a child support review officer who will be employed by the registrar for that single purpose. That is a very good move. The intention is that the parties will be able to have an assessment reviewed in light of their individual circumstances. This review will be a mandatory first step in the general appeal process allowable under the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the review may be based only on the grounds that are presently set out for appeals in the court. These are quite narrow and, indeed, very technical. For example, the amount payable under the formula which I referred to in stage two is calculated on a non-custodial parent's gross income for the preceding taxation year. The current income can be reassessed by the agency only if it varies by more than 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this Bill introduces a long overdue administrative discretion which it is claimed will allow individual circumstances to be reflected accurately in the ultimate level of payments, the fact is that that basis of review is limited to present appeal grounds. The rigidity of the current formula will be only partly ameliorated and the scope for considerable injustices will undoubtedly remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the administrative problems, a number of serious criticisms have been made of the agency. I will highlight a couple of these quickly for the benefit of the House. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 30 September last year an article headed `Child support scheme gets a crack from Ombudsman's whip' highlighted a report from the Federal Ombudsman revealing complaints by custodial parents&mdash;90 per cent of whom are mothers. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Child Support Agency (CSA) which administers the scheme is crediting the payments from custodial parents although the money was never received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-custodial parents, on the other hand, complain that the CSA is refusing to credit payments because the custodians say the money is not real child support.</PARA>
<PARA>That, in anyone's language, is gobbledegook. Nevertheless Mr Cameron, the Ombudsman, highlighted this fact in the article. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of complaints I get for example, say things like. . . this really aggressive one [I got] the other day from a mother saying `this agency is hounding my son' because the son was unemployed and the agency finds it, I suspect, very difficult to cope with changes of circumstances like that</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cameron went on to say that complaints about the scheme included the lack of shopfront offices. I do not know whether this is still the case, but people in Canberra, for instance, had to deal with an office in Chatswood in Sydney, although new offices were planned to open shortly. Perhaps they may now have opened. The scheme was already the fourth biggest source of complaints to the Ombudsman. Nearly 350 extra staff have been employed over the past year, but Mr Cameron said that despite this there had been no fall in the level of complaints. In September, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't say they've dropped off yet. . . It's rather that they've probably reached a plateau and, whether they're actually now going to start settling down, we shall see.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) also referred briefly to a case in Western Australia which was reported only a few weeks ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> concerning a case of sensitive information going astray from a government department. In that case, it was the Child Support Agency in Perth. Some information which had been meant for somebody else had gone to a particular gentleman who had already been involved in a bungle concerning the Child Support Agency when details which were supposed to be sent to his estranged wife were sent to him and his details were sent to his wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be fair to say that there are some problems within the agency. I shall summarise them. Processing delays occur and are still very extensive. The fairness of the formula is very much in question and, as I understand it, a study of this formula assessment is being undertaken by both the Department of Social Security and the agency at the moment. The use of taxable income as the measure of the non-custodial parent's ability to pay has been the subject of much discussion ever since the formula assessment was proposed. Finally, the accessibility of the appeals process is potentially an area of great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to conclude, I would have to say that the Opposition agrees with the general thrust of the Bill but makes the basic point that the Child Support Agency has a lot more to do. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill, I wish to say at the outset that I support, and have supported, moves that took place in relation to the establishment of a new system, apart from the one that we had prior to 1989. I say that because I was actively involved in the former system, and I was involved in the latter system for a year or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting point about this is that although the principle itself is certainly good, the practice has been fairly diabolical. I do not think anyone would disagree with that. I was looking through a speech made by Trevor Boucher to the Rotary Club of Adelaide on 30 October last year when he said that only 420 appeals have been made since formula assessments began on 1 October 1989. So there is obviously something diabolically wrong with a system that delivers so many problems at one end but at the other end is quite simply not resolving them. I hope that this Bill will resolve some of those appeal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the interest of the House, I point out that special grounds must be attended to in appeals against the use of the standard formula. Those special grounds are that a parent cannot provide proper support for a child because of the necessary commitments to other children or to other people; that the cost of maintaining the child is affected by the high cost of access, the special needs of the children or the cost of education; or that the assessment is unjust because of the financial circumstances of a parent or of a child or because of payment or transfer of property previously made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court can order that the annual rate of child support be varied; that the child support percentage be varied; that other calculations involved in the assessment be varied; that part of the child support be paid by lump sum, transfer of property or in some other way; that more than the maximum be paid and/or that child support be paid where a parent's income is less than the exempt amount. Where the Agency accepts or refuses to accept an agreement about child support, appeal to the courts may be made within 28 days of notification, as under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we left with at the end of the day? We are left with a system that appears to have extraordinary inflexibility. If one gets through the maze at the end of the day, there is provision for variation or deviation from that formula. I do not think that the simple fact that there have been only about 420 appeals reflects in any way the community concern about the inflexibility of the system. But the difficulty is that I am not entirely convinced at this stage that the amendments in the Bill will address the fundamental problems within the system. It is no secret that Child Support Agency officers&mdash;and I do not know what it is like throughout the rest of Australia, but I certainly know what it is like in Victoria&mdash;are quite simply unable to cope with the volume of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there are two ways of addressing that. One is just to keep on feeding in people to try to resolve the problem, the other is to remodel the system itself to ensure that those delays are dealt with and dealt with quickly. There would not be one honourable member in this House, I dare say from either side, who has not had numerous complaints about the Child Support Agency. More often than not, I suspect, those complaints are related to the workings of the agency, as opposed to the philosophical approach to maintenance payments and the philosophical approach to a set formula being imposed on the non-custodial parent. But it seems to have become tangled up in this vicious web, and I think some of the views are that the baby can be thrown out with the bath water. In my view that is not appropriate, but we need to be mindful of the very real concerns about the operation of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there have been only 420-odd appeals, I suppose it begs the question: why has there been only that number of appeals? Is it because there have been only 420 people dissatisfied with the system? Even the most realistic assessment would say that that is not correct. Is the formula system generally accepted as the correct one and, therefore, everyone is jumping up and down with glee? I do not think that is right, either. The appeals have been bogged down and lost in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there were cost impediments to taking appeals to court, and I think that in some respects that was the reason why there were only 420 appeals. My concern is that if we take away those cost impediments and free up the system by giving independent assistance to the Child Support Agency itself, once word spreads of that easier availability of a review process the Child Support Agency will simply not be able to cope. There are then decisions that have to be made by the agency and by the Government as to which way they are going to approach the matter. Do they put no funds in? Do they put funds into the independent assessment part, as referred to in the Bill? Or do they give money for the administration side of it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the delays in replying to correspondence and answering queries about whether payments had been made are absolutely intolerable. I will refer to one instance that I have at the moment. I was speaking to a gentleman from the Child Support Agency in Geelong yesterday. This matter has taken up an enormous amount of time in my office&mdash;and I would be more than happy to try to assist this gentleman&mdash;but it has also taken an inordinate amount of the time of the Child Support Agency. There is this constant process of the backlog continuing to roll on because of the inflexibility within the present system to resolve some of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day we can have Bills, we can have Acts, we can have a wide range of things, but this is still an extremely emotional area. There are those who quite simply will not respect the system because they do not respect a system that led them into a position in which they are non-custodial parents. No amount of detailed paperwork or amendments to Acts is ever going to resolve that very significant emotional problem in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has gone a certain way towards solving this problem by providing this internal review mechanism which, for want of a better word, `de-courts' the process. I think that is a healthy sign and it may well add some respect for the system. But if that `de-courting' is not going to resolve those problems, then the more attempts are made to patch up the system, the more it loses credibility. Once we take away the credibility, the system starts to break down very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some extremely interesting papers have been delivered in relation to this matter. The Australian Institute of Family Studies in its report No. 29 of August 1991 went into this question very thoroughly and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the years that spanned the first and second phases of the study, the climate of child support in this country changed radically, at least for one group of parents. Stage One of the Scheme, which came into operation in June 1988, collects money already due under a court order or a court-approved agreement and transfers it through the Child Support Agency. Stage Two was introduced in October 1989, with its main feature the automatic assessment of amounts payable by way of an administrative formula. . . All respondents to the evaluation were excluded from entry into Stage Two, as their separation or their child's birth had proceeded the 1 October 1989 cut-off date.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice that this matter came before Cabinet last year; there were moves to incorporate all parents in the system and Cabinet decided, wisely or unwisely, not to proceed with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper says that although the Institute's evaluation was not intended to look at the operation of the formula, the findings have strong implications for its widespread application. For example, comparison of stage one support entitlements arising out of court orders in 1990 with stage two assessments&mdash;that is, made according to the formula&mdash;during the same period showed the former averaged about $8.50 per week lower than the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects there is no doubt that the system is delivering the sort of increases in maintenance agreements and maintenance payments that it was designed to do. I support that, but&mdash;and I am afraid there are always lots of buts through this system&mdash;as the paper says, another observation is that registration with the agency does not guarantee prompt payment. Just more than half or 55 per cent of the registered custodial parents in the survey reported receiving support payments following new entry into the scheme. The agency's own figures show that 55 per cent of these parents received payments within the statutory pay cycle, with the compliance figure increasing to more than 70 per cent with time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compliance period is getting better, but there are still great problems. Going to the Bill itself, I refer to the private collection of maintenance in relation to administrative assessments, especially for pensioners. I might be reading this incorrectly&mdash;if I am I am quite happy to say that I might be missing the point&mdash;but presumably these alterations in the Bill in relation to pensioners are to address the potentially long delays that pensioners suffer at the moment because the maintenance might be paid seven weeks before it is actually received by the pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it that this is one of those steps used to try to reduce those long delays. If I am correct on that basis&mdash;and perhaps the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), could clarify this for me&mdash;there does not seem to be a similar level of support provided to low income non-pensioner custodial parents. I think that matter should be addressed because their requirement for that quick payment of the maintenance is as important as it is for pensioner custodial parents. I think that matter has been overlooked and should still be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has never been the intention of the assessment process or the scheme itself to limit people agreeing to arrangements for the support of their children.</PARA>
<PARA>It may not have been the intention&mdash;I am prepared to accept what the Minister says&mdash;but it has certainly been a potential outcome. Hopefully, these amendments to the Act will resolve that system. The big complaint about this system is that it has not allowed reasonable, rational people to sit down and discuss what is the appropriate outcome for their family. I believe that the institutionalisation of this whole system has led to an enormous amount of aggravation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to honourable members the Australian Institute of Family Studies article that I referred to earlier. It gives some very interesting figures on the perceptions of custodial and non-custodial parents in relation to the Child Support Agency. What is extremely disturbing is that there is a perception amongst non-custodial parents that, once they have put some dough into the bickie barrel, the other end drops off. The other end is the access. Some say that the maintenance has been their lever to ensure ongoing access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would find it quite distressing for a system to continue where financial matters determine the availability of ongoing relationships between non-custodial parents and children. Quite frankly, that is an absolute disgrace. It may or may not be that non-custodial parents have had an involvement in the matrimonial breakdown; often it is but sometimes it is not. But one can rest assured that at the end of the day the kids&mdash;the meat in the sandwich in this whole system&mdash;have had nothing to do with it; nothing at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the system since 1975 and it has continued even with amendment after amendment; that is, the kids are still the meat in the sandwich. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I saw it on a professional basis day in, day out&mdash;the big losers are always the kids, and that is very sad. It is absolutely imperative that this Parliament ensure that we have a system whereby financial matters bear absolutely no relevance at all to the emotional side, because once the two get entwined we get real problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) has prepared a very interesting paper on this. I am sure he will address some of those matters in his speech, but his paper refers specifically to the emotional part of this whole system. The emotion is where there has been a big hole dug: one throws in the money, the parents and then the kids; then one puts a cap over it and expects them to all spring up as three happy little daisies. The reality is that the plants do not grow the way the system wants them to grow. Each different patch will have one or two strong daisies but it will be a different daisy each time, and the reality is that all three never come up shining. As I said before, that is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill addresses some of those concerns but I do not think it goes far enough. I know the Fogarty report is coming out shortly in relation to this. It may even be tabled tomorrow. I hope that Mr Justice Fogarty, the Chairman of the Child Support Consultative Group, has looked beyond the financial matters, because what is desperately needed is the implementation of a caring system that delivers support to children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the basic thrust of the Child Support Agency because I believe that at the end of the day the delivery of financial support to children is a lot better than under the previous system. It is enshrined in the Family Law Act that the welfare of the children shall be the paramount concern of the court or whoever it might be. Let us not lose sight of that fact&mdash;it is the children who deserve and require that support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we need in this country at the moment is division. I believe the family unit is of paramount importance to this country. The protection of the family unit has to be the basic thrust for every single thing that comes out of this Parliament. I am incensed when I read about minority groups saying that the Australian family unit is a thing of the past; that it is no longer necessary and no longer required. I challenge those people to justify their stand on that. I have absolutely no doubt that the majority of honourable members in this House still believe in their heart of hearts that the family unit is the sole economic and emotional unit in this country. In my view, anything that impedes that should be knocked on the head very quickly. This Bill addresses some of the concerns that I have in relation to the Child Support Agency, but there is a long way to go. I think a very close eye will need to be kept on the administration side of the self-assessment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to vote against the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. I think it is a disastrous piece of legislation and I will vote against it at the second reading stage, even if I am the only person in this House to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency is a totally inappropriate body to have any form of responsibility for the maintenance of children. In my view, it is such a devastatingly bad organisation that there is no point trying to revamp it to give it some appropriateness for the maintenance of children. The only feasible recourse is to completely scrap the Child Support Agency and restructure the method of collecting child maintenance payments, and also to provide other support for children living with only one parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency, as honourable members should know, is nothing more than a collection agency that has little or no interest in the welfare and nurture of children. The Child Support Agency, in fact, is a branch of the Australian Taxation Office. Its function is to collect money from non-custodial parents in a similar way to the Taxation Office. Honourable members should be aware, even if they are not, that the Child Support Registrar is Mr Trevor Boucher, who is also the Commissioner of Taxation, and that the Deputy Registrars of the Child Support Agency are the Deputy Commissioners of Taxation in each State. So the Child Support Agency is nothing more than a branch office of the Taxation Office. Its function has little to do with the welfare and nurture of children. It is totally misnamed as a child support agency. I believe the Government's intention in implementing the Child Support Agency is not to provide support for children but to reduce the demand on the social welfare budget coming through the sole parent benefit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from a letter that I received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) dated 25 June 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence indicated that between 1973/74 and 1985/86 sole parents had risen from 9 per cent of population to 15 per cent and, of those, the number reliant on social security entitlements from 65 per cent to 85 per cent. Social Security payments in the same period rose from $160 million to $1,757 million and continued to rise to $2,334 million in 1989/90. The Government firmly believes that these statistics provided no alternative other than to introduce such widespread reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Government's intention in implementing the Child Support Agency is to reduce its commitment to the sole parent benefit scheme, and it has no other objective. Consideration of the circumstances, though, where children are living with one parent should be separated into two categories. The first category comprises children born illegitimately, out of wedlock. Very often such pregnancies result from promiscuous sexual activity. In such cases there is little emotional bonding between the parents, the mother usually assumes custody of the child and the father displays very little emotion or responsibility to either the mother or the child. The mother usually then makes a claim under the sole parent benefit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its introduction in 1974, the scheme has been widely criticised in the community because it encourages and distorts the once stable cultural values in our community. It is often claimed that young single girls purposely become pregnant in order to maximise their social welfare benefits. I am not sure whether such claims are accurate. But, as Senator McMullan has confirmed, the cost to the taxpayer through the sole parent benefit scheme is becoming crippling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Government introduced the Child Support Agency in order to recoup money from the fathers of illegitimate children and, therefore, reduce the demand on the social welfare budget. However, if the problem is with the sole parent benefit scheme, it is surely more advisable to revamp that scheme than it is to introduce a body that completely distorts the second category of children living with only one parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category consists of those children who are born in legitimate wedlock and whose parents subsequently have either separated or divorced. In those circumstances there is a degree of emotional bonding between the parents and, in a great many cases, there is a very strong bonding between both parents and the children. In the majority of cases before the Family Court, custody is awarded to the mother of the children and the non-custodial father is required to make maintenance payments in support of both the mother and the children. In very many cases, of course, a court order is provided for the fathers to have access periods to the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, as my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has pointed out, there are many cases of separation and divorce where bitterness develops between the parents, and campaigns of both viciousness and vindictiveness between separated parents are all too common. In such circumstances, as my colleague has pointed out, the children become merely the meat in the sandwich and are torn between their natural love and bonding for both their parents. Sadly, the children very often become mere tools to be used by a vindictive parent to exert even more emotional pressure on the other parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the division between the parents, a great many non-custodial parents do the very best they can to provide financial and emotional support for their children. However, the Child Support Agency completely distorts whatever remnants of the relationship may be left. The Child Support Agency insists on involving itself regardless of whether the arrangements between the parents are working satisfactorily or not. More alarmingly, the Child Support Agency becomes another weapon to be ruthlessly used in any vindictive campaign. Non-custodial fathers who willingly support their children are often forced to pay more than they can afford. The money goes to the mother, not to the children. In fact, there is no accounting or follow-up to ensure that the children actually benefit from the money provided. Very often access orders from the Family Court are totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a non-custodial father is being victimised in such a way, the bureaucrats and the lawyers simply advise the father to take the matter back to the court. But in taking a matter back to the court it costs even more money for fathers who are being stripped of all the moneys that they currently have, and it provides no guarantee of justice, fairness or compliance in the future. In such circumstances the Child Support Agency disclaims all responsibility and claims to be merely acting in accordance with its Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there are many mothers who have been deserted by irresponsible fathers and left with no emotional or financial support. In such circumstances as these I know of many cases where the Child Support Agency offers no help at all to trace irresponsible fathers. Very often mothers have been told by the Child Support Agency that if it can find the father and discover where he works it will then issue a garnishee order so that money can be claimed from the father and directed through the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the House: how much support is that for a destitute mother? One would need to question the motives of the Child Support Agency and whether in fact it is genuine in trying to provide support in these unfortunate circumstances, or whether this is merely a bureaucratic process trying to provide jobs for people who work within the bureaucracy. I firmly believe that all family matters should be brought under one umbrella and not separated, as they are at present, between the Family Court and the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would have to say to the House that I am equally dissatisfied with the Family Court and with the counselling systems offered through the Family Court and by marriage guidance counselling. As honourable members would be aware, and my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat has already alluded to it, I have circulated a paper to all members of parliament which is designed to completely restructure the administration of separated families. Whilst I do not have the opportunity this morning to incorporate that paper in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I would commend it to all members of parliament, and I would gladly and freely make it available to any member of the public who had an interest in reading it and commenting on it. But, in the meantime, I consider that this legislation is nothing more than a bandaid measure that is designed to patch up a disastrous system. Because I consider it so totally inappropriate I will not give it my support, and I intend to vote against it at the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not listed on the speakers list, but I just want to say thank you very much to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has taken the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill through on behalf of the Opposition. I also thank the other members of the Opposition who have spoken on it. I particularly recognise the contribution by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) in presenting a document, which I believe he has circulated, which goes to the fundamental problems of not only the Child Support Agency but also the Family Court. As both of these are the subject of inquiry by committees which are yet to report, I feel that his type of contribution should be made and should be listened to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the matters on which we get representations within our individual offices as members of parliament, there are probably none so bitter, so divided or so lacking in compromise or negotiation as arrangements unsuccessfully sorted out in the Family Law Court and then put into the hands of the Child Support Agency. They are impossible positions to deal with. Many suggestions are made by the people involved. At all times I refer them to the committees involved, but one wonders whether their suggestions are listened to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should talk specifically about the consultations and advice that the honourable member for Lyons has suggested. It is just not possible to get consultations that would heal a rift or prevent a separation in the same way as a judge in a court could do it. I believe that these matters should rest with people who have greater experience in solving problems instead of being allowed to drift as they obviously are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many would suggest that perhaps the Child Support Agency is not a natural function of the Australian Taxation Office, and I think many tax officials would agree with that. They would suggest also that because child support relates to social security the agency should be part of the social security system. If that were the case, perhaps there would be a greater understanding of some of the problems that came before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second point made by constituents is that the Child Support Agency is very hesitant to take action in some cases; yet it is prepared to impose its will in others. I mention the instance of a woman who has a maintenance action against her former husband. In his former employment no action was taken to make sure that he made his maintenance payments. He has since become self-employed and there is still no action in train. This has been going on for about two or three years. The woman in question is being denied her rights in this society because in order to maintain the child on her own she has to deny herself things. That is just one case in which the Child Support Agency should have taken action, but it has not. I referred this matter to the Minister of the day and suggested that the Minister look at some alterations to the system that might require an up-front payment, something like happens with provisional tax, for the self-employed. In fact, I think it is the prime responsibility of the agency and of the two separated parents to ensure that the child is looked after in all circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third suggestion that is made to me is very much in line with a letter circulated from a Western Australian man who puts the position very succinctly. Problems are raised with me by clients of my office who suggest that a percentage of income before taxation is a different proposition from a percentage after tax has been paid. One must bear in mind that parties paying tax at the single income rate and not the married income rate could quite easily be paying 35 or 40 per cent of their net income in tax as opposed to 27 per cent. In certain circumstances that makes it very difficult for one party not only to maintain the child support payments but also to live separately from that point on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Bill itself there is a suggestion that payments made for children outside the maintenance area will now be recognised. One of the great anomalies of the system has concerned custodial rights. An ex-husband may take full custodial rights and look after the child totally for one or two months. In that time the maintenance has to be paid. However, he receives no family allowance or tax benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the whole system needs a review. I hope that the current inquiry can get to the real depths of the problem because, as I say, the most bitter cases that we come across, where there is no hope of reconciliation, are at times exacerbated by the lack of attention by the Child Support Agency. A greater degree of diligence and perhaps a bit of commonsense in these cases might assist. Again I say thank you very much to the honourable member for Curtin for assisting me in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill will implement the social security initiatives announced by the Labor economic statement of 26 February. It proposes three initiatives: a one-off lump sum payment to family allowance recipients, an increase in the family allowance supplement, and the elimination of rent assistance waiting periods for more allowees and beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986 are minor and relate to increasing the FAS component of service pensions paid to service pensioners with dependent children. I would like to make some further observations in connection with the veterans' affairs side of it later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one-off family allowance bonus will be tax free, as with ordinary family allowance payments. Families not receiving family allowance but entitled to do so as at 2 April 1992 will have three months in which to lodge an application if they wish to receive the bonus payment, which will then be made on the next family allowance pay day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment will also be made in respect of children in institutions at the basic rate of $125 a child and will be paid to the institution. There are some 4,000 such children in around 400 institutions, ranging from orphanages to juvenile detention centres. Around 1.9 million families with 3.7 million children will receive this one-off bonus. However, the payment is poorly targeted and even regressive. A family with low or no income will receive the same bonus payment as a family on an income of $65,000, in the case of families with two children, and an income of $75,000 if there are five children in the family. This is verging on the obscene. After years of being told that welfare is being targeted and is going only to those most in need, we get this ridiculous one-off payment of $125 by way of family allowance for those families with fewer than five children and $250 for those with five children or more. One has to ask what this payment will do for families which have no income&mdash;families in which the parents are unemployed. What will this payment do to help those people get back into employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask also: what will this payment do for those people trying to survive and pay their rental or, perhaps, repayments on a house in an atmosphere in which real interest rates in Australia are too high and are propping up the dollar and the exchange rate? People would have to look very carefully at this payment. At the moment it is difficult for Australians to avoid being cynical and identifying this one-off payment as a Wills by-election bonus, and I think they are well justified in that cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That people earning $75,000 a year can be eligible for this sort of handout is the very antithesis of welfare targeting. The people who are desperately in need of more help than a one-off transparent bribe are those who are out of work, those on low incomes and those trying to pay off a house. Yet here we have a payment that will go to all those earning up to $75,000 a year, irrespective of their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This payment will go to many hundreds of thousands of Australians who simply do not need it. Where is the sense in this sort of cheap and transparent gimmickry? I now foreshadow my second reading amendment, which has been circulated to honourable members. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Government's family allowance proposal is little more than a one-off electoral gimmick&mdash;albeit a very costly one&mdash;which pales into insignificance when compared to the Coalition's Fightback proposal for substantial and permanent increases".</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that this payment is conscience money. It is an apology for the recession we had to have, but it is utterly irrelevant in terms of solving economic problems. The money could have been much better applied if it had been given directly to charitable organisations to disburse&mdash;as a number of welfare agencies have said. The cost of posting personal cheques from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;this is the cynical way in which the Government will make the payments&mdash;will not be much less than what the Government is handing over to voluntary agencies, a mere amount of $2m this year, to alleviate distress in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were in any way serious about trying to help those who have suffered most from the recession, it would not give the money to fat cats, particularly those without a need. It would not disburse it in such a way that it is almost dissipated by sending off 1.9 million cheques. It would give the money to the voluntary agencies to disburse to the real needy and those who have really suffered as a result of this recession we had to have. Pensioners, superannuants and the frail aged have not been given a look in in the Prime Minister's economic statement. They miss out totally on the proposed tax cuts, as delayed as they are, as do all people on lower incomes. Surely this is a travesty of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will dwell a little on the frail aged&mdash;the people who have worked and served all their lives for Australia and who now need some care and comfort. Nursing homes around the country are being forced into bankruptcy and receivership because of inadequate Government funding and the recession that the current Prime Minister said was necessary for Australia. This Government must acknowledge that it, as the Government of the day, has a prime responsibility to maintain a high quality of care for residents of nursing homes and hostels and to ensure adequate funding for the industry within the guidelines which it sets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That quality of care is at risk today because the Government has failed to face up to the nursing home funding crisis. In Victoria, one of the States targeted for employment opportunities by the Prime Minister in his spending package, the situation is critical. Over 19 per cent of nursing homes have been forced into bankruptcy and receivership. Unless relief comes soon there will continue to be massive nursing home closures around Australia with consequent unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand the Prime Minister is trying&mdash;albeit on Australia's international Bankcard&mdash;to create employment, whilst on the other he is creating potential unemployment as nursing homes close, discharge their employees and leave our frail aged at severe risk. At the same time he is putting the quality of care for our frail aged at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the coalition's Fightback package does for families, for those on lower incomes, for the aged, for pensioners and for superannuants. The Fightback package introduces a new family allowance structure which doubles family allowance payments from $20 to $40 per child per fortnight for families on incomes up to $30,000; increases the allowance by 50 per cent for families on incomes between $30,000 and $40,000; raises it by 8 per cent for families with incomes over $40,000; and starts to phase it out altogether for families in the $55,000-plus range. We believe that this is proper targeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback package the dependent spouse rebate, currently available to all taxpayers, will be raised by $300 to $1,679 for families with children on incomes up to $75,000, but will be phased out after that point. Low and middle income families will also benefit from a private health insurance tax credit of $200 per year for families on less than $30,000, and the package will provide for a superior delivery of health and hospital care&mdash;something which is not there at the moment. There will also be a cheque for $2,000 for families on less than $40,000 to help them buy their first home. It will give young people wanting to establish a home of their own a real break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package also contains tax free savings to a limit of $2,000 for families who earn less than $50,000. People aged under 35 years can use superannuation benefits for home building. There are changes to, and reductions in, the rate of capital gains tax. This will help small family businesses and those people looking at retirement. All benefits will be increased by 6 per cent to compensate people for the 4.4 per cent CPI effect on the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional $90m will be provided for increased child care support. The coalition is committed to increasing funding of voluntary, non-government agencies by $50m, which will be a great advantage to many families who are currently suffering the effects of financial hardship. The most important benefit that government can provide for families is the opportunity for employment, which brings financial security and self-respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's high growth economic strategy, it has been independently estimated that unemployment will fall to 5.2 per cent by the year 2000 and the number of jobs created will rise by nearly two million. This is of particular concern in a community where Mr Recession, the current Prime Minister, has built up the number of unemployed people to one million. The young, particularly, are severely affected. I think that the level of youth unemployment stands at about 30 per cent. That is an indictment of the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real jobs can only come from encouragement and incentives to business. If we look at businesses today, we will see bankruptcies and liquidations that have been a legacy of Labor are only a part of the problem. The number of business people in my electorate who have just walked out, closed their doors and gone on with something else is innumerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package includes a comprehensive reform of the taxation system. This will substantially lessen the amount of tax paid by working families, improving take home pay, offering an incentive to work harder and to earn more and raising the capacity of families to save for the future. Under our taxation reform package, personal income tax will be cut by $13 billion. More than 320,000 Australians who currently pay tax will no longer have to do so, and 95 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30c or less in the dollar. We will also clamp down on tax avoidance by high income earners who escape their obligations at the cost of average Australian families. Family running costs will be lowered by the coalition's commitment to abolish petroleum excise completely, saving motorist families about 19c a litre, or about $11.40, every time they fill the tank of their car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this, education is a major concern to parents and to grandparents as standards have reduced under this Labor Government. More youth are being pushed into higher education but without the facilities and resources necessary to give them a decent education. The coalition's education policy will be of great benefit to all Australian families. Parents will have a much greater role to play in the education of their children. The coalition's emphasis will be on funding the individual rather than the institution. Such an approach will return quality and excellence to education, further strengthening the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific initiatives in education include a significant increase in recurrent funding for non-government schools; doubling of capital funds for non-government schools to $162m; increasing funding for TAFE by over $450m in a six-year period;  and a range of other programs comprising schools of choice to promote best teaching practice, quality of teaching programs, literacy and language programs, national monitoring of standards and a special program for gifted children. In addition, education fees will be zero rated for the goods and services tax and the cost of education services is expected to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal particularly with the superannuation and saving components of the package and how they relate to families and people who are about to retire. The coalition's generous tax rebate for contributions to a superannuation fund will provide great incentive to all families to plan for their retirement, while providing additional security to the family unit. The abolition of Labor's lump sum superannuation tax will also provide older family members with a significant financial boost as they approach retirement years. </PARA>

Such contributions will immediately be vested and preserved in the name of the beneficiary. In fact, the irrational behaviour of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Ms Fatin) was indicated the other day when she was unable to address herself to a question. The answer she gave starkly demonstrated the negligent manner in which the Labor Government treats women under its One Nation policy.

This means that at current interest rates, over four million married couples with children who have a taxable income of $50,000 or less will pay no tax on the interest income for the first $25,000 of net savings. </PARA>

In designing our Fightback package, our tax reform package, the coalition made as one of its top priorities ensuring that Australia's aged would be appropriately and properly compensated. Where possible, we also wanted to provide additional assistance in their retirement. The coalition believes that Australia's aged are a special group. They have worked hard for their country and have fought for it in two world wars. In retirement, they deserve as much assistance as possible to help them live in security and with dignity. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-funded retirees will benefit from the increase in the tax threshold and from the significant reductions in the marginal tax rates.

Again, I just refer to the refusal of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to answer a simple question from the shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) last Monday on what the One Nation policy does for superannuants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and oppose the Opposition's amendment, which is nothing more than a political stunt on the part of the Opposition to get its Fightback package mentioned once again in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, as the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) indicated a few days ago during Question Time in answer to my question, there are great advantages, in an ongoing sense, in the family allowance supplement changes that have been made&mdash;that is, the $3 per child per week increase that has been proposed as well as the one-off payment. For the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) to cry about the poverty of people in the community and then ignore completely the increase in the family allowance supplement&mdash;which, of course, is a stimulus to the economy and an ongoing assistance to families&mdash;is quite hypocritical and very wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides for the implementation of three social security measures which were included in the One Nation statement for economic recovery delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As I have mentioned already, these include the one-off payment to recipients of family allowance, effective from 2 April&mdash;which is not very far away. I think it will be appreciated greatly by families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the House, I point out that $125 will be paid to a family with one child; $175 to a family with two children; $200 for three children; $225 for four children; and $250 for a family with five or more children. That is a one-off payment, and we are pleased that it is a one-off payment because those families need money and they will spend the money. It is a well-known economic fact that if one puts a stimulus into the lower end of the community, the money will be spent immediately&mdash;the people need every cent they can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, pensioners have come to me and said, for the same reasons, that if a government were to pay a Christmas bonus, for instance, it would be spent immediately by pensioners in the community. I am not suggesting that we do that on this occasion, but I think this one-off family allowance payment is a very good and well thought through economic stimulus, which also&mdash;and importantly&mdash;assists families in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item which this Bill covers is an increase in the family allowance supplement of $3 per child per week as an ongoing improvement in the living standards of pensioner or beneficiary families and low or middle income working families with dependent children. As this House knows, in the main the family allowance supplement is cash for working families. That is also a very important aspect of the Government's social policy mechanism because it has acknowledged that not all employers pay their people a very high rate and that even where awards exist and are paid, they will not always be enough to enable a person in employment to support his or her family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter a long time ago when Senator Chaney was Minister for Social Security and I was merely an electorate officer for a member of parliament. I thought at the time that it was totally unfair that people who had substantive family responsibilities were not able, because of their financial commitments and family responsibilities, to accept a low paid job and were actually better off on the unemployment benefit. I suggested that the government of the day&mdash;which was, of course, a Liberal-National Party government&mdash;should sponsor a scheme which would assist families to make that decision to go into the work force and yet be assisted by the Government in doing so. Obviously it was cheaper for the community and for the Government, and better for the family, if the person accepted the work and was assisted by the Government to supplement his or her income to take account of the number of dependants in the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I endorse this package wholeheartedly. I am very pleased that the Minister and the Government have seen fit to expand this payment by $3 per week per child in an ongoing way so that these families can be slightly better off than they are currently. And it will add to the economy at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item in this package is, of course, the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods for social security recipients, except for single beneficiaries without dependent children under the age of 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package is commendable. It assists and complements the Government's already very proud record of integrating sensible and sensitive social policy so as to assist those people in our community who are most in need. It represents a compassionate response to the current recession and will help to stimulate economic activity by injecting $317m into the economy in April&mdash;plus, of course, the ongoing extra expenditure of many millions of dollars in ensuing years through the increase in the family allowance supplement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I meant his past portfolios, of course. The honourable member should stop interjecting&mdash;even if he is just talking to the Minister across the table. The Government has consistently considered not only the income situation of pensioners, beneficiaries and low and middle income earners but also their living conditions and their capacity to improve their relative positions in society in a number of ways. For instance, in this Bill the Government addresses the needs of many poorer people in the housing sphere by reducing the waiting period for rent assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rent assistance is paid to low income people in rental accommodation. The availability of this assistance complements and supplements the rebate rental system for public housing which is administered by State governments. Rent assistance of this kind makes it possible for a family to live within cooee of employment if rents are reasonable. It removes the necessity&mdash;I believe admirably so&mdash;for all low income people to live in public housing estates, which are frequently, although not always, situated on the fringes of the cities where land is cheaper and away from centres of employment. Regrettably, many housing estates are not well serviced by public transport and a majority of residents are unable to afford to own and run a car. Such factors make a real difference to the ability of low income people to obtain and retain a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully some State governments, including Western Australia, have adopted a public housing purchase strategy which ensures that a mix of housing is available for tenants; that is, there is a pepper and salt approach to purchases of existing housing. Rather than establishing big housing estates in fairly sizeable blocks, individual houses or small blocks of houses are purchased in and around the city area. I believe that this is a very good use of public money because it ensures that low income people are not put in accommodation where they cannot have access to public transport or are a long way from centres of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The settlement patterns of people cannot be seen in isolation from the totality of support and community services available. It is surprising, therefore, to see that the Opposition is proposing a cut of hundreds of millions of dollars in public housing. When the linkages between transport, housing, health care, child-care and employment are not addressed, it is the poor and the powerless in our society who are most disadvantaged. I need not remind honourable members, I am sure, that often the most poor and the most powerless are women and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I commend the Government for its continued support of the JET program&mdash;the jobs, education and training program&mdash;for which women are frequently able to apply and for which all sole parents, including men, are very grateful. I have had a number of seminars in my electorate on this program and people are now increasingly aware of the provisions of JET and the fact that child-care is made available if a sole parent wishes to pursue education, employment or training. If a person wishes to get into training in the short term, he or she is able to access child-care with the assistance of the Government. I believe that is a very important aspect of the whole package of social security measures and employment and training measures that this Government has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proper provision of community services and infrastructure such as housing, roads and transport systems requires the development and maintenance of a partnership between local, State and Federal governments. Whether or not everybody in the House agrees with it, I think the outreach to State governments has been very helpful in many of these areas in trying to improve that relationship and to improve those links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's Better Cities program will demonstrate ways in which these linkages can be improved so as to benefit those who are less well off in our community. For instance, the Better Cities program could facilitate the construction of a medium density housing development in conjunction with a new transport terminal which would ease access of the local population to an existing light industrial area or a small business hub. I think those are the sorts of changes we have to make in our thinking as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not sufficient for the Commonwealth Government to leave infrastructure to the States or to local government. Often neither of them has the money and the Commonwealth Government certainly could assist with a demonstrative and pilot approach to such ideas. I know that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has a particular interest in trying to ensure that these sorts of projects are able to be demonstrated through the Better Cities program to State and local governments around the nation, so we can learn from the experiences of those projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's phoney concern and crocodile tears for the poor in the community are not convincing, especially not convincing to me. Its talk is not matched by its actions; in fact, the policies it is proposing would cut $2 billion from the social security budget. The Opposition would, as we have indicated on a number of occasions, cut off the unemployment benefit to people after nine months. It would also, in the same stroke of the pen, artificially lower unemployment figures. I think this is a particularly cruel way to proceed and I certainly would not support any such action if it was proposed by the Government, which it is not. Furthermore, no amount of Opposition rhetoric, of which there has been quite a lot in recent months, can disguise the pernicious impact of a 15 per cent tax on every piece of meat, every loaf of bread, every litre of milk, every piece of fruit and every item of kiddies clothing purchased by an ordinary family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this ugly tax proposed by the Opposition levied on the necessities of life? The simple answer is that it raises more money to tax food, shoes and clothing. What section of the community spends most of its income on life's essentials? As I indicated before, it is the poor, the pensioners and the lowest income earners in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A goods and services tax is inherently regressive. It takes no account of ability to pay. It is the tax one pays every day come what may. A goods and services tax hurts the poor more. The compensation formula trotted out by the Opposition cannot possibly make up for a 15 per cent impost on consumption at the lowest end of the income scale. It does not matter what the models say, the people in the community are very well aware of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition consumption tax is a greedy, iniquitous trick to continuously steal 15 per cent from the pockets of housewives, from the wages of workers and from the purses of pensioners. It will be paid at the supermarket, it will be paid at the child-care centre, it will be paid at the pub; in fact, this invidious tax will be paid on virtually every item and on every service which Australians consume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if this theft by stealth was not bad enough, every small business man and woman in the nation will become a reluctant and perplexed tax collector. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker will all have to collect this tax from their customers, as will the hairdresser, the handyman, the mechanic, the plumber and the builder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also needs to be borne in mind that these business proprietors, shopkeepers and service providers will not convey the tax to the Tax Office, or the Government, until such time as they have deducted all the inputs to their goods and services upon which tax has already been paid. Calculating the tax to be paid to the Tax Office will be a nightmare for small business. Moreover, the time involved in undertaking the collections, the calculations and the conveyance will be unpaid time. It is a cost that each individual enterprise will have to bear. If it is to have a consequent effect on people's purchasing capacity, which it will, it will also mean that people will buy less at those very businesses and this will affect their capacity to continue to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, our Government, through its previous actions and the measures contained in this Bill, is adding to the capacity of Australian individuals and families to cope with their responsibilities. We have no intention of introducing a 15 per cent consumption tax on the essentials of life, but we have every intention of continuing to provide a supportive environment for people who need our help. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said in his speech that the Government is keen to target special assistance to needy groups, including families with children. We do not dispute the fact that these people are needy. Families with children are amongst the most needy groups of people in our society at the moment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, as we consider the impact of what the Government proposes in this particular Bill, assistance is being given by the same mechanism to families on high incomes. We will not necessarily argue that they should not be entitled to assistance as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A family with five children certainly has its work cut out in providing for those children in many different ways, but a taxable income of $74,000 would give it considerable scope for taking care of even five children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, I am saying that this proposal is regressive. One can only assume&mdash;I think this is the point that has come through very strongly in the Opposition's criticism of the Government's One Nation package&mdash;that it is a cheap trick. It is a fistful of dollars aimed to coincide with the Wills by-election. As somebody very cleverly said the other day, `Where there's a Wills, there's a way'. The Government's way is to time these little cheques in the mailbox to coincide with the Wills by-election. How else can one interpret this particular action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not doubt that people on low incomes with families are desperate. That desperation has been created by this Government. They are going to get this one-off payment. Those on low incomes may well use it to some benefit, but I wonder about those on high incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the Government's proposed tax cuts we find that a person on $100,000 will be $2,464 better off, but someone on $20,000 will be no better off. The Government refutes that. That is the effect of the Government's proposal. Is that progressive or regressive? Under the Government's scheme, someone on $100,000 gets $2,464, whereas a person on $20,000 gets nothing, zero, zilch in tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange thing is that, despite that, many beneficiaries of these handouts recognise that there is something fishy about them. I have spoken to a number of people in my electorate and they have said, `I guess we won't knock it back. If I go out to the post-box and find a cheque in there I am not going to have it returned to sender. I am going to take it'. But they wonder&mdash;and I think all thinking people wonder&mdash;what it is all about, what is the point of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost of the package we are talking about in this particular legislation is $317m in April, plus ongoing costs. But where is the money coming from? That is the question we on this side of the House have asked consistently of the Government on this matter. I think most thinking Australians, faced with these sorts of handouts, are asking the same question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) got terribly excited the other day and said that this was fiscal stimulus and that, if it were funded, it would not be fiscal stimulus. In that sense he is technically correct. In effect, in making that point he is saying that the money is going to be borrowed. It is unfunded; it is going to be borrowed. I think that concerns many Australian people. When people look at these handouts, these cheques that are coming in the mail, they are asking whether our country can afford to go into debt any further. Well might they ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people who are experiencing difficulties at a household level ask, `Where do we go from here? Can we have some fiscal stimulus on a household level'? The answer for most people is: `Sure, we can put more on Bankcard'. That is fiscal stimulus on a household level. People are beginning to understand that the way the Government is approaching solving the country's problems through its One Nation package is to do exactly that. In other words, it is prepared to take the huge risk of plunging this country further into debt by creating this stimulus at this particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a high risk strategy indeed, for if it does not work the country will be worse off. That is without going too much into the economics of whether the timing of stimulus is advisable. A number of economists around the country have actually questioned the wisdom of even what is a relatively mild fiscal stimulus at this stage in the cycle. There is a real risk that as we move further into the recovery phase this could exacerbate the recovery and push us into a further boom-bust cycle, and that is not desirable from anyone's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is&mdash;and it hurts the Government when we talk about it&mdash;that since 1976-77 family allowances have dramatically declined in real value. By almost every measure families have been consistently hurt by this Government. It has been pointed out in the debate in the last few days, I think very clearly, that this Government has ripped $22 billion from Australian taxpayers simply through bracket creep. I do not think bracket creep means very much to the average person in the street. Economists and accountants probably understand exactly what we are talking about but the average person only needs to know that the Government's tax system has actually taken out of their pockets $22 billion by stealth, which it should not have been entitled to take from them. That is what it boils down to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make the point to the honourable member for Cowan, who stood in this place and gave us all those sob stories: if we put it in perspective, families have been hurt by this Government&mdash;that is the bottom line&mdash;but handouts are not the solution to the problems of these families, nor do I believe that the handouts to pensioners will necessarily solve their problems. I believe the Government has engineered and fostered a welfare dependency in Australia that is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Handouts are easy and we hear Government Ministers standing up day after day, telling us what they have done for the unemployed and for this group and that group. However, the Government has simply given them handouts and we now have an alarming degree of welfare dependency in this country. I heard the other day that almost as many Australians get some sort of handout or welfare payment from the Government as there are in the work force of the country. I think that is something most Australians would be very concerned about. We have in this package further examples of how far the Government is prepared to go to buy votes and simply to hand out taxpayers' money for no apparent purpose other than exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Australians want self respect and that comes ultimately from being paid to do a worthwhile job. Welfare is no substitute for jobs. There will be ongoing debate in this place about job creation. That has started in terms of our undertaking to create jobs and the Government's attempt to match that in some way, but the bottom line is that the Government will actually be faced with the fact that it has actually cost jobs when it goes to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been said almost ad nauseam, but I have to remind Ministers in the House at the moment that they created an enormous problem through the level of unemployment. It is a problem that exists now and it will be a problem for the next generation as we find a large level of youth unemployment; the social problems created by that will be almost immeasurable hardship. That will be the Government's legacy for the people of Australia, and I do not think it is a very happy one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where there is such a stark contrast between what the Government proposes to do and is doing in its package, out of desperation, and what the Opposition proposes in its Fightback package. The amendment we have moved here today indicates that effectively the Opposition is not going to oppose the measures the Government proposes to introduce here. I think that would not be any help so we will not decline to give the Bill a second reading, but we note that the Government's family allowance proposal is little more than a one-off electoral gimmick&mdash;albeit, as the minute said, a costly one&mdash;which pales into insignificance when compared with the Opposition's Fightback proposal for substantial and permanent increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the Fightback package we find a special emphasis on the family. We intend to reduce the burden that millions of families have had to carry under Labor. We propose tax cuts that will substantially benefit low income earners. It must be a great embarrassment to the Government to find that its proposed tax cuts do nothing for low income earners. We have said that time after time. We have not heard any reasonable explanation why that should be so other than the hollow explanation given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who said, `Oh, well. We have helped those people until now; we have already given them all the help we are going to give; we are now into helping the middle income earners'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell honourable members that sort of excuse rings very hollow among people who are earning less than $20,000. That is a lot of people; millions of people who will see no tax cuts under the Government's One Nation proposal. What does the Opposition propose? Under phase 1, from October 1994 those on incomes of $15,000 will receive a 32 per cent tax cut; for those on $20,000 there will be a tax cut of 28 per cent; for those on $25,000 there will be a 25 per cent cut; and for those on $30,000 there will be a 24 per cent tax cut. So it goes on. We have purposefully engineered our statement so that the tax cuts will aid substantially low income earners. They will do more than benefit people to compensate them for the introduction of a broad-based tax based on the goods and services tax. Families will be better off under the Fightback package: the family allowance will be doubled; the dependant spouse rebate will be increased by $300; petrol will be cheaper; education will be more accessible and health care will be better. </PARA>

He acknowledged that the family income supplement was arranged and produced during the Opposition's period in office. Do those opposite know how much money was spent in that first year&mdash;it was not a whole year, I understand&mdash;of the family income supplement?  Two million dollars was spent on the family income supplement. But how much are we spending next year?  Next year we will have built up spending under the family allowance supplement to $1,000m. That is the comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition acknowledges the importance of an FIS-FAS system as the only means to deliver money directly to those on low incomes, but it provided only $2m in 1982-83. Next year we will deliver $1,000m&mdash;a billion dollars&mdash;to those people. I note that the honourable member for McPherson, having given the rabid speech in favour of those who live on the Gold Coast, did not oppose the Bill. He does not oppose the payments. He said that no-one could afford it and no-one could pay for it but he did not oppose the Bill. He is happy to see $1 billion go into the pockets of those people who need it on the Gold Coast but he still put his ideological arguments as to how we cannot afford an FAS. Those opposite agreed with the system. They helped to introduce it. Decent lobbyists during the Opposition's time in Government obviously promoted the idea that using tax cuts was not the best way to deliver funds at the bottom end. Instead we use what we call a transfer payment&mdash;the family allowance supplement. Those supplements are indeed being supplemented by means of the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up on another point that the honourable member for McPherson made. He spoke of the tragedy of youth unemployment. There are too many young people unemployed in this country. I know it and the Government knows it, and we are doing a great deal to remedy it&mdash;but, of course, we know that there is a shortage of jobs. But I do not like the use of the statistic which says that about 25 per cent of youth in this country are unemployed. They are not. Just over 8 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds in this country are unemployed. The figure is too high; I acknowledge that. It is 8.8 per cent because 91.2 per cent of youth in this country are either in jobs or in training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are fewer youths unemployed today than there were in 1982. That is absolutely true. It is because we have ensured that those people are in training or in education, which is a decent thing to do. No-one will get a job in Australia today without sufficient education to usher him or her into the work force. There are not the jobs such as sweeping factory floors as there were during the Great Depression of the 1930s. People need to be trained. It is only decent and right, if one wants to talk about the levels of youth unemployment, for instance, to use the correct statistic; that is, that over 90 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds are in work or in training. Sure, it is very difficult for the remainder, who are looking for work. Over 20 per cent cannot find work once they have stepped beyond training or education. I say to the honourable member for McPherson: please do not throw around those wild statistics, because they do not help anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the question of FAS. Again, we should not be obsessed with the notion of income tax cuts. Income tax cuts are fine for those, like the honourable member for McPherson, who earn good money and find that every cent or two we can drop off the marginal rate of tax provides us with a good extra disposable income. It does nothing for those at the lower end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance supplement is designed to pay money to working people on low incomes. It rises according to the number of children in the family. It is simple. It is designed explicitly and expressly to give money directly to low income families, especially those with children. We have debated this for 15 to 20 years in this country, but the Government, including the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, has helped to design a system that delivers disposable income to those who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not like this crocodile tears business of those in the Opposition suggesting that we are not looking after those at the bottom end. We are; we use the FAS system. Using FAS and income tax cuts together, we can actually have a decent level of redistribution of income in this country. We cannot do it using the tax system alone. Those opposite discovered it in 1982; we perfected the method subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year we will be spending $1 billion whereby we transfer from the general taxpaying public down to those who already pay very little tax but whose disposable income is patently not sufficient. This latest boost to FAS and to the family allowance&mdash;for which we are giving an extra one-off payment&mdash;makes a great deal of sense in terms of the economy, because those people who have an income low enough to receive family allowance or family allowance supplement actually spend nearly all of their money. Any dollars that we distribute under family allowance and family allowance supplement will be spent and have a kick-on effect in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some figures that go to this question. A study undertaken by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research in Melbourne estimated that a $100m increase in family allowance expenditure, which is about 50c a week per child, would increase disposable incomes by $200m and employment by 2,000, and at the same time would have almost no impact on the rate of inflation. These family payment measures will cost $367.3m in 1991-92 and $240m in 1992-93. There is a direct economic benefit in using the FAS system. It is decent in terms of the distribution and redistribution of income. It is also more than decent in terms of the stimulus that it provides to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has a very peculiar understanding of this notion of disposable income. The concept of disposable income for those with a high income is that they do not need to spend all of their money. They can save some of it; they can put it away. But those on low incomes dispose of it all. They need to</PARA>
<PARA>spend all of it mainly on rent and food. Every dollar put into the households of those with very little income is in fact spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the analysis of the Opposition's package which was tabled here yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) talked about the concept of a savings ratio. That is, one tries to get a measure of all the people at income levels in this community to see how much each of them is able to save out of their incomes. The Treasurer provides us with some startling assumptions which the Opposition has made about how much Australian families save&mdash;extraordinary assumptions. The Treasury, having analysed the Opposition's package, has indicated that the Opposition has constructed a number of cameo families who might represent real-life Australian families in the community. The Opposition has picked examples from its household expenditure survey of people who have high savings ratios in order to artificially reduce the impact of its consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury has examined these examples and determined the implied savings ratios. The Opposition gave us the following examples:</PARA>

<PARA>That is extraordinary, but more extraordinary examples follow:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mary and Greg, on one income of $537 plus Family Allowance of $20 a week, with 2 children, have a savings ratio of 38 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot imagine how they can save 38 per cent of their disposable income if that is all their income is and they have two kids and are on family allowance. Here is another example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Julie, an unemployed person, receiving a benefit of $139 a week. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is profligate. It is really nasty that we give the unemployed a whole $139 a week! The honourable member for McPherson thinks that is over the top. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Julie, an unemployed person, receiving a benefit of $139 a week, manages to save 26% of it;</PARA>
<PARA>She did not eat that week. She could not save 26 per cent of her disposable income if she were unemployed and receiving a benefit. Another example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Harold and Dulcie, age pensioners on $252 a week&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>combined&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have a savings ratio of 47 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Dulcie took a holiday on the Gold Coast in the week that the ratio was measured. She was staying with her in-laws and not spending any money; she was living off them. Pensioners cannot save that amount of money on that low income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition really does not appear to understand that people at the lower end need to spend all their money to live decently. Consequently, to deliver the greatest benefit to those who need it means delivering it through a system called family allowance and family allowance supplement. That is the only decent direct method of payment that really hits the spot. It is acknowledged by all the commentators in this area that we should not use the tax system to try to deliver income benefits to all people. It does not work. It is an inaccurate means of delivering what we call transfer payments. It is a dumb method; yet the Opposition is obsessed with using the tax system as a means of delivering and redistributing income. It does not work. It has not for years. The Opposition has acknowledged that. We have refined the system and we now use it decently to give an enormous boost to those at the lower end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has made a claim&mdash;a ploy&mdash;that it will look after those at the lower end of the scale. What about the impact of inflation that would be brought about by a consumption tax and would hurt those at the lower end who have to spend all their money? These are not cameos; these are real people with low incomes who have to spend all their money. Obviously, if prices rise, these low income earners do not have the discretion to say, `I will hold off on a purchase'; they have to spend all their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury's analysis of the impact of the Opposition's consumption tax found that inflation might well arise on basic components of household budgets. It found that clothing would rise by 11.2 per cent; electricity would jump by 10.7 per cent; post and telephone services would rise by over 8 per cent; and&mdash;this is the awful one&mdash;health services would rise by 22.6 per cent. There is little service that is more basic than health service. Food is important and clothing is important, but people cannot say no when they are sick. We introduced the Medicare system in this country so that there would be no need for a person to think about whether to go to a doctor to seek assistance, as one million or two million Australians had to do prior to 1983. People do not have to think about that now. They can go to the doctor to seek assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But under the Opposition's package we will find that health will once again become a matter of discussion and debate within a family&mdash;`Look, can I get the kids to the doctor this week?' `Well, I'm sorry you'll have to hold off because the money has run out. We cannot afford for you to be sick this week. You will have to wait until the next pension cheque comes'. That is not good enough. If we also find on top of that a 22.6 per cent rise in health costs as a consequence of the consumption tax, then I do not think, in all decency, that the Opposition is treating those on low incomes well at all. It is simply not able to deliver to those people on low incomes as we have delivered to them consistently and well over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To conclude, I have to refer to the Opposition's package because the Opposition comes into this House to debate our family allowance packages and complains about the fact that we are using this most accurate method to redistribute income to those who need it. I need to, if you like, analyse the Opposition's alternatives; that is what debate is about. The Opposition makes three key assertions about the redistributional effect of its package: first, that all groups in the community show increases in average disposable income after allowing for the effects of the consumption tax; second, that there is a bias in the package in favour of families with children; and, third, that the distribution of net benefits is skewed in favour of lower income groups. What did the Treasury find? Treasury's analysis has demonstrated that each of these three claims is untrue. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consumption tax appears to be little more than a disguise for a redistribution of income from lower and middle income earners to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>The beauty of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement system is that everyone knows where the money is going to. We have to walk into the Parliament and literally pass across the table how many dollars the taxpayer is prepared to spend on the family allowance supplement. The other beauty is that we also know exactly how many dollars go to how many families and in what combinations. It is absolutely explicit and overt. Everyone can measure how much money is being redistributed. When it comes to election time, it is only right that people should understand where the dollars are flowing to. Under the family allowance system, people can make their own judgments about the goodness and rightness of the amount of money we distribute under the current systems of taxation and family allowance from the top end to the bottom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not only is the Opposition not interested in transferring money in that way from the top end to the bottom, but also it argues that in fact it is going to look after the bottom end. But the Treasury does not think so; we do not think so. What is more, the Opposition will have such a confused and opaque sort of system to hide the real distribution of dollars which it wishes to move from the bottom and the middle up, that no-one will be able to make up his mind. I am telling the electorate now that the Opposition had better go for the model which is explicit and open where it can count the number of dollars coming from the general taxpaying public and which is transferred to those who need it&mdash;decent working Australian families who can count each dollar that comes to them from the Government, courtesy of the taxpayer, and understand how those dollars relate directly to their income, their needs and the number of children in their family.

In 1990, before the recession hit us in full force, the Social Policy Research Centre of the University of New South Wales told us that couples with children&mdash;the families that we are targeting today&mdash;with average incomes or below had experienced a drop of 4 per cent in real disposable income between 1983 and 1990.

The number of people seeking emergency food at welfare centres had increased by 40 per cent. In my own electorate, the same thing has happened. Even before the recession, the Marion Church of Christ could not keep up with demands for food and bedding and things to help ordinary people live. This was before the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story does not end there. There is an economist at the Macquarie University School of Economics and Financial Studies called Marc Lombard. His job is to look at income redistribution in Australia. His last paper was published last year and looks at Australia during the period of the Labor Government when the present Prime Minister was Treasurer, before the recession that we had to have. What were his findings? For one thing, he worked out a handy little number called a co-efficient of inequality. Economists are really clever; they work out these cute little numbers that mean things. This co-efficient tells us how much inequality there is between the rich and the poor. Perfect equality is zero, perfect&mdash;I do not think that is the right word&mdash;inequality is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened between 1982-83 and 1988-89 for the period that he had the figures, before the recession hit? There was a 21 per cent increase in inequality under the Labor Government. Is that not a great record? There was a 21 per cent increase in inequality under this Government&mdash;this Government which tells us how much we support the rich and how much it supports the poor. But, if one actually looks at the record of the Labor Government, one will find that throughout its whole term of office it has supported the Bonds, the Murdochs, the Packers and everyone with money, and it is the poor people who have suffered. They have gone down 21 per cent. That is what happened under this Labor Government which is all talk&mdash;the Labor Government which talks about care and concern for the poor. </PARA>

The recession has destroyed the dreams of young men and women. In compensation for the recession, families are to get $125&mdash;only for one child, of course&mdash;in a one-off payment in April. What a joke!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just see Daddy handing it to little Susie and saying, `There you are, dear. There is $125 instead of a job and instead of a future. Spend it wisely'. When Dad is made redundant, maybe he can use the $125 to pay off his mortgage. Why $125 and why in April? How is this going to solve any of the problems created by the recession? The answer is, of course, that it will not. The $125 is a bribe. It is a handout to the people of Wills before the by-election. `Here is $125. Buy a pair of shoes for the kid and vote for the Labor candidate because the Prime Minister is a nice guy after all'. That is what it is there for, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that we could not actually target the electorate of Wills and go around door to door handing out $125. T<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>hat would have been a much more economical way to do it, but probably would not have looked very good for the rest of the electorates. So the Government has given $125 to all families with earnings under $75,000 and with children&mdash;just to buck up the people in Wills, the people with their dreams shattered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members have any doubts, they should have a look at this $125 and the way it has been targeted. This Government talks about how well it targets the welfare dollar. Have honourable members heard it? We were the ones that did not know how to target our welfare dollars; we just handed out money to everybody. But this Government has been telling us how good it is at that. It targets those in need&mdash;so it has given $125 to families earning up to $75,000 and with children. Is that not targeting indeed? I can just see how much the person on $75,000 is going to appreciate that $125. My colleague Senator Alston suggested that perhaps people could go out and buy 2 1/2 bottles of Veuve Clicquot. That is targeting. They say, `Do not throw it on the rich; make sure your money counts; only give it to those in need'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston reminded us, the Anglican Home Mission Society, amongst others, said that the money would be better applied given directly to charities to disburse because they can target it. The charities know the families that do not have enough money to buy food to feed their children or to buy blankets for them this winter. They know the families that have to go begging from charity to charity saying, `Have you got a saucepan that I can take back to cook in because we do not have the money to afford those saucepans?'. That is what the charities could have done. They could have picked the families that needed the money. But no. Instead, this Government gives $125 to everybody who has children and who earns under $75,000. The charities in my electorate could have certainly made very good use of the money. They could have targeted it to the families in need. But perhaps that would not have sat so well in Wills and would not have won the votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the cost of this exercise? Total non-targeted spending is $317m alone; that is, non-budgeted spending. Where is the money coming from? We have not been told that. Let us not forget to add to that the cost of postage to send it out. Postage to the 1.9 million people will cost almost $1m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes that are remaining to me, I would like to compare what the Government has given to families&mdash;the $125&mdash;and what the Fightback package offers to families. In the Fightback package, the Opposition has targeted families, realising that, under this Government, families in Australia have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, we are not offering a $125 one-off payment in April to families. What we are doing is doubling the family allowance, putting the money where it is needed. The Opposition would direct it at children&mdash;not in a one-off payment before a by-election, but on and on and on, fortnight after fortnight. We will increase the dependent spouse rebate from $1,300 to $1,679, an increase of $379. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about health insurance? When I go around my electorate I find families who have, let us say, a mild chronic illness in their family or children who need special care. They cannot afford to wait to get into those overcrowded public hospitals. These people say to me, `Chris, the one thing you could do for us would be to cut the cost of private health insurance. It is breaking us to pay for private health insurance, to make sure that our children, our father, our grandmother, can get into hospital'. That is what we have done in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will give a health insurance tax credit to low and middle income earners. For example, those families earning less than $12,000 a year will get a health insurance tax credit of $400. This is to help them to afford health insurance like the rich mates of Labor can. There is $2,000 towards the price of the first home for low income earners and a tax-free savings scheme for families earning less than $50,000. There is $90m in tax incentives to make child-care more affordable and $50m worth of funding to voluntary agencies. That is the Fightback package. Would honourable members not say that that is somewhat more substantive than the $125 offered to families in Australia before the Wills by-election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak only very briefly on the Government's increase in the family allowance supplement of $3 per child per week. The Opposition is supporting this increase. We have to support it considering the straits that poor families are in under the stewardship of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will abolish all rent assistance waiting periods for social security recipients, except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children aged below 18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past we have opposed this, but I must say that the recession has changed things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want briefly to respond to the points that have been made. I would like, first of all, to thank the members of my own Party who supported the measure; at least they knew what they were talking about. I must say that, when I listened to the first speech from the Opposition, it seemed that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) was reading the wrong speech because there was scarcely a reference to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the House, and what brief references there were were wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what the debate has done well is to illustrate that the Opposition can no longer go rabbiting on with last year's speeches on the Fightback program, such as we heard from all three Opposition speakers. What the Opposition has to do now, if it is to have any credibility on social welfare issues, is to address the issues that have now been raised in the debate over its Fightback package. We did not hear that from even one of them. Even the passionate member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), bleeding for the poor, gave us no explanation about the $2 billion cuts in social welfare that is in the Fightback package&mdash;not a mention of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does have to face that question. It has to explain to us how the least well-off in our society will benefit as a result of that $2 billion cut. It will also have to explain to the people of Australia how the least well-off in our society will benefit from the $1 billion cut to State services when the States provide most of the services about which the Opposition has wept this morning. That is another $1 billion cut there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, members of the Opposition make these bright speeches about the Fightback package and ignore entirely the fact that it is now broadly accepted by all objective commentators on the Fightback package that there is a $4 billion black hole in the accounting of those opposite, which means that most of the compensation they talk about cannot be paid unless they are prepared to massively revise their package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly want to refer to other points which show, on the whole, the massive ignorance of the Opposition on social welfare matters. We had two of the three Opposition speakers talk about cheques, with possibly a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), being sent out to all the people on family allowance. That might be a good idea, but it is not the way that the system works. If they knew anything about the operation of the family allowance system, they would know that, in nearly all cases, the moneys paid out to families in family allowance is paid directly into a bank, without a cheque and certainly without any letter from the Prime Minister. But, again, they do not understand the operations of the system that they wish to talk about and wish to criticise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the comment from the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that somehow he is appalled by welfare dependency in this society. We are all concerned about welfare dependence in this society. As I pointed out in this House last week, on the latest figures we have, the proportion of people on welfare, as a proportion of the Australian population, is less than it was in the last year of the Fraser Government; that is, on the latest figures we have, the proportion of pensioners and beneficiaries is smaller than it was in 1983. Those opposite never take any notice of this. They ignore entirely the way this Government has targeted the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the honourable member for Hawker quote a series of economic indices from various economists, which she did not understand, as though they are measures of inequality which are not disputed amongst economists themselves. I will refer briefly to the real figures, the facts which are on the record for anyone to see. They do not require some economist to do a whole lot of detailed statistical analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what we have done for poor families, the families that need assistance&mdash;that is, low income families and the families of beneficiaries&mdash;in the nine years of this Government. In our time, the amount for the family allowance supplement has risen from $2m to this year's $700m. With this package it will move to $950m or roughly $1 billion next year. That is a fact well ahead of inflation; well ahead of all of the other statistical things one could bring in. A growth of that order in the family allowance supplement means that, clearly,  this Government has effectively delivered moneys and resources to families in need. The honourable member for Hawker&mdash;who produced these statistical oddities, which she does not understand&mdash;has to face that fact. She has to answer the fact that, in the nine years of this Government, aid to the children of beneficiaries and low income families has risen, in real terms, by 50 per cent for those children under 13 years and over 100 per cent for those children between 13 and 15 years. The children she talked about and shed her usual crocodile tears over have been major beneficiaries under this Government. There has been a 50 per cent increase in real terms for low income families and beneficiaries with children under 13 years, and a rise of over 100 per cent for those with children between 13 and 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, anyone who listened to the contributions to the debate from those on the other side would have scarcely known that we did three things in the Bill. One was a one-off payment to all on family allowance, simply to provide an impetus into the economy, to help to get it moving, along with all the other measures we took in the One Nation program. That was the purpose of it. All the evidence suggests that getting that money into the hands of families is the quickest way of using welfare moneys to provide that kind of stimulus to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly&mdash;this was hardly mentioned at all; I noticed that the honourable member for Hawker mentioned it in about her last sentence&mdash;we have done the very thing that all of those opposite have criticised us for not doing. To all low income families and beneficiaries, that is people on family allowance supplement, we have given a permanent $3 increase per week per child, which will be a continuing payment, week after week, because we are concerned with the targeting as well as the immediate stimulus that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that we addressed was the need for rent assistance, particularly for the young unemployed. I noticed that the honourable member for McPherson made remarks about the problems of the young unemployed. This Bill addresses one of the problems that he never mentioned, that is, the need to reduce the waiting period for young beneficiaries without children; the children have already been dealt with in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the major points I wanted to make. I think that anyone who reads the debate can make a judgment on which side is really concerned, has the knowledge and understanding and has done the work, in a very difficult situation, to improve the welfare of the less well-off in this society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So I should. The point is that bracket creep is all about an individual's taxation position in relation to the legislated tax scales compared with what that position would be had the tax scales been adjusted for inflation. In other words, if indexation of the tax scales took account of the inflation changes, there would, of course, be no bracket creep. The position of the taxpayer would be identical before and after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not a matter of the CPI&mdash;that is, inflation&mdash;driving the revenue. The revenue is, in fact, driven by earnings, not the CPI. What was done in terms of making the revenue estimates was to take the Opposition's assumptions of earnings growth, which is 3.5 per cent. Revenue grows in response to growth in earnings. The Opposition assumed that it was 3.5 per cent. That was factored into the Treasury's analysis. It is an entirely different proposition to then take account of indexation and bracket creep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the calculation of bracket creep the inflation figure was used because that is the extent to which prices are rising and that is the extent to which someone is going to be disadvantaged as a result of non-indexation of the taxation scales. The figure which was used came out of the Murphy model&mdash;in each of the three years, something like 6 or 7 per cent. I referred to the figures yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point is that if the taxpayers were going to be compensated for the actual effects of inflation on tax scales, the amount that should have been handed back would be about $4.2 billion, not the $3 billion which the Opposition has said it is handing back. This is not, by the way, as compensation for bracket creep, but as compensation for the GST. Do not let anyone run away with the idea that there is $1 billion worth of revenue that is not accounted for. There is not. The revenue is driven by the earnings growth&mdash;the 3.5 per cent. The indexation factor for the tax scales in order to eliminate bracket creep is the 6 or 7 per cent which comes out of the Murphy model.</PARA>

The industry employs 60,000 Australians, 6 per cent of the total manufacturing work force. In 1991 it achieved record exports of $1.16 billion. In our One Nation plan we have cut the sales tax on cars from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, a saving of about $800 on a six-cylinder vehicle. The tax cut was good for industry, good for the environment and good for road safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, importantly, this morning I was at the new Toyota plant at Altona in Victoria. Today is a great day for our motor vehicle industry and a great day for Australia because we saw a vote of confidence by the third largest car maker in the world in setting up a state of the art $400m plant in Victoria to make a world ranking product to sell not only in Australia but also to the world. That vote of confidence is in stark distinction to the kind of doomsaying from the Opposition about the investment environment, about its belief, or lack of belief, in the Australian work force; about its rejection of any partnership between government, business and labour; and about its generally gloomy view that Australia cannot keep up in terms of manufacturing and cannot cut the mustard in terms of investment.</PARA>

The plant will operate under an industrial agreement which was actively sought and encouraged by the ACTU, by the unions concerned and by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Government and the Federal Government worked together over a period of a couple of years with the company to clear the hurdles and get this plant going. It is an absolute example of a partnership between all levels of government, business and unions to make an industry better and stronger, and to make the Australian car industry better and stronger. It is an enormous vote of confidence by the Toyota Motor Co., which is the third largest car making company in the world, and one which has a very aggressive manufacturing and marketing strategy. It is an enormous vote of confidence by that company in Australia which undermines a lot of the supercilious gloomy talk by the Opposition about Australian workers and about our industrial capacity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fowler for his question. Of course, the difference between anyone's view of the Fightback package now and that of a few days ago is that we now have not just the Opposition's claims about the alleged benefits of Fightback but also some professional analysis, properly done, on this whole package, which is all about shifting $40 billion worth of Government money from one place to another. Of course, what the Opposition tried to maintain until the time it was caught out by the papers tabled yesterday was that everyone would be a winner. We now know that everyone will not be a winner, and something like 70 per cent of households and 80 per cent of taxpayers will in fact be losers. But the intriguing part of all this, as indicated by the interjections, is that anybody who gets in the way of the Liberal Party's campaign, anyone who dares to question any aspect of its analysis, any assertion that it makes about its proposals, is instantly blackguarded, abused, insulted and accused of being essentially inspired by base motives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not actually. If you are, stand up and take a bow. I will tell the truth. It is about time that you not only started listening but also started telling the truth yourself. You are the one who has been running around Australia saying that every household will benefit when you know, Professor, that that is wrong. What you are saying is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just give a wonderful example of the way in which the Opposition Leader has tried to personalise this wonderful proposition with his cameos. The Leader of the Opposition said, `We will select a few typical Australians across a diverse group of families and individuals in a wide range of circumstances and prove that the net benefit of the package is substantial'. He went on to say that these cameos demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the income compensation arrangements included in the package. As I indicated yesterday, most if not all of those cameos are highly selective, if not totally contrived. In a sense, if those people who are winners under the Opposition's scheme are not high income earners, they are mythical Australians; they do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these cameos involved a 22-year-old woman called Julie, who is unemployed and on the Newstart allowance. According to the Liberals' package, she ends up being $3 better off as a result of their changes. Julie must be a very special kind of unemployed person. In the first instance, she can afford to save 26 per cent of her unemployment benefit every week. This either demonstrates how out of touch the Liberal Party is with the circumstances of unemployed people or it may give the real reason why it wants to cut off that benefit; it thinks that unemployed people are doing well, that if unemployed people can save one-quarter of the unemployment benefit, they must be doing too well, so after nine months the Liberal Party will cut off the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Julie's unique circumstances are not confined to that. The Liberals say that she will be unaffected by a large number of their other expenditure reductions which have not been factored into their calculations. They say, for instance, the fact that the CES will have $160m cut from its funding will not affect Julie's chances of getting a job;  the fact that the Liberals will axe a number of labour market programs, such as $22m from the self-employment assistance arrangements and $56m from Jobtrain, will not have any effect on Julie's opportunities for getting a job or for getting the training which is a necessary prerequisite for many people like Julie to getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the Liberals say, Julie will be totally unaffected by the fact that the Opposition proposes to cut $400m from support for public transport and housing and through a general squeeze in State expenditure. In other words, the fact that public housing availability will be reduced, that rents may well go up, will not affect Julie or other unemployed people like her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has failed to demonstrate all of the effects of its package on households and individuals. As the Liberals say, this is difficult and cannot be done down to the last dollar. But it can be done a lot better than the Opposition has proposed to this point, where all it has wanted to do is include all the beneficial sides of its compensation and changes and very little of the adverse effects on people like Julie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about the Treasury's analysis is that, if anything, it is generous to the Opposition in that the Treasury does not attempt to allocate all of these expenditure reductions to the States, where the States will have to put up bus fares, where the States will have to put up rents for public housing and where the States will have to respond in various ways. Those kinds of things have not been taken into account. When anyone is looking at these mythical cameos, that person should take into account not only that they are unrealistic but also that they massively understate the actual effect of the coalition's package on real Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the same time, it has provided one of the highest quality health care systems in the world. If we look at the Opposition's policy, we see that it would have us go down the United States road where health expenditure is at 12 per cent of GDP and where the health system is universally recognised as a shambles. The Opposition's policy would have us effectively underwrite the costs of private health insurance, encourage a massive increase in doctors' fees and lead to a blow-out in health costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has conservatively estimated that the Opposition's policy would increase total national expenditure on health by the order of $2 billion in 1991-92 prices. Treasury has estimated that it would add 0.7 per cent to the CPI and it would do nothing to address the underlying needs of the nation's health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only certain outcomes are a rise in medical incomes and a slug on the sick. The benefits of Medicare would be destroyed and the up-front cost to the sick of a visit to the doctor would rise from zero to $31. Under the regressive tax package of the Leader of the Opposition, medical insurance would be set according to the AMA schedule&mdash;the so-called Shepherd-Schneider schedule. His supplementary paper No. 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA schedule level would be negotiated between the AMA and the health funds.</PARA>
<PARA>The schedule would be negotiated not with the Government, but between the AMA and the health funds. Under the Leader of the Opposition doctors would be given free rein to raise fees under their own schedule. The AMA schedule would be propped up and underwritten by private health insurance. The Opposition would have the AMA and private insurers coming to an agreement on the level of fees to be used for insurance purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this cosy deal, control of the nation's health bill would be just handed over to the AMA and private health insurers. The Opposition would legislate to prohibit bulkbilling to all but card holders. This anti-competitive move would take away the crucial restraint on doctors' fees through the competitive forces created by bulkbilling. In a further anti-competitive move, it would force insurers to cut the rebate for any patient who goes to a doctor who charges less than the AMA schedule. The only incentive created is for higher fees, and that means higher costs for average Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I ask this question of the Leader of the Opposition: did he understand the deal that the specialist oncologist over there did with his AMA mates to abolish competition, to give every doctor a vacuum pump to clean out the pockets of the sick and to add $2 billion to the nation's health bill?</PARA>

<PARA>That is as clear as day, and you did it anyway. The Government's attitude on bracket creep is that we are not returning it properly; but the Government does not do it at all. As Senator Button revealed yesterday when he let the cat out of the bag, the Government has no intention of doing it either. Furthermore, its record on this is anything but perfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will say that the tax scales today are as if they had been indexed since 1983 and, therefore, it has a good record on bracket creep. But it does not tell us that we have not had that consistent indexation of tax scales in the meantime&mdash;from 1983 until now&mdash;and many people have paid more in bracket creep as a result. In fact, it is about $22 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To just reveal the extent of the hypocrisy of this: in the Treasury minute, part of the press release which was finally released this week to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, we had a statement from Treasury making the point that governments have an obligation to return the proceeds of bracket creep. Treasury slipped it in; it is very good at this. In the fine print it just slips in that qualification to try to protect its reputation. You said in your own statement that that standard ought to be maintained by governments&mdash;that was their responsibility. Yet you fail dismally to return the proceeds of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The truth of the matter is that, in the next year or so under this Government, 100 per cent of taxpayers are not going to get a return of the proceeds of bracket creep. They are not going to get a return for three long years&mdash;1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94. Under the One Nation proposals announced last week, they will not get it back until 1994-95. The Government is attempting to apply a standard to the Opposition. The Opposition is committed to the return of the proceeds of bracket creep, yet the Government fails dismally to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To add insult to injury, under the Government's package the people least able to withstand the ravages of the recession we had to have get absolutely nothing. Worse still, they will cop the effects of bracket creep in the meantime. In the tax scales they get nothing. Yet the Government has the audacity to make the claims it has in respect of Fightback based on bracket creep. It has an appalling record on the issue. It is not prepared to recognise the importance of returning bracket creep in the future and it doctors the figures by using a $3 billion figure on the revenue side and a $4.2 billion figure on the distributional side in the package. I think that is a black and white case. It is a clear case of distortion purely for political ends. I believe that the House ought to censure the Treasurer for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not the only issue where I think there has been a duplicity by the Government and an attempt to fudge the issues so as to disguise the benefits of Fightback and to build up the benefits of its own package. The second big issue is how it treats the allocation of expenditure restraint in the coalition's package. In a sense, it ought to be an issue to one side, inasmuch as many of those reforms are efficiency reforms that we would undertake regardless of the introduction of the GST. For example, we ought to merge the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service because that will be a more efficient delivery of the service. In a proactive employment program for those who are unemployed, you may cut expenditure in some areas, but you may well cut it because somebody has a job, because we are going to abolish payroll tax. That is not a cost to households; that is a benefit to households. You people in your analysis go too far in trying to fudge the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You allocated expenditure cuts in the face of advice from Treasury that if you are to do it you should do it all and not leave anything out. In the face of that advice you proceeded to selectively allocate the expenditure restraint. I might say we did not allocate the expenditure restraint in the Fightback package because it simply cannot be done. If it were to be done, and if we had wanted to blow up our package, we would have taken the $1.4 billion worth of wealth compensation and pumped up our package with that. Alternatively, we would have taken the $500m leading up to $600m in additional tax relief through the introduction of our tremendous new scheme&mdash;tax free savings. It is a great scheme which will allow people, on their new savings, to save free of tax up to $1,000 for a single or $2,000 for a double. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You in fact selectively took the expenditure restraint that suited you and allocated that across households knowing, firstly, that you had advice from Treasury that if it were to be done&mdash;and it can really be done only in theory&mdash;then you ought to do it all; and, secondly, as Neil Warren, who is one of Australia's leading experts on this, said, if you are to do it in theory then you ought to also complement what you do on the expenditure side by factoring in the benefits of the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not do that because we are not prepared to overstate the benefits of Fightback. The benefits are there obvious enough for people to see without doing what you did last week with your One Nation statement, which was basically to take a bicycle pump to it and blow the thing up out of all proportion. It is no wonder that the markets have been so critical and so many independent economists have been critical of the incentive effects and the forecast that you have in that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that it cannot be done. You went ahead to do it selectively to suit your own purposes, and to follow through that methodology and do it properly you ought to have built in the incentive effects. There are many incentive effects. For example, with regard to payroll tax, we had a report released in January&mdash;since the release of Fightback&mdash;from the Centre of International Studies commissioned by the Service Industry Coalition and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. It was funded by the Government and commissioned by those two bodies. It came to the conclusion that just the abolition of payroll tax itself could add to the size of the national cake, the GDP, by about 1.5 per cent. That is a huge benefit. It is about $5 billion or $6 billion there for the taking if you have what it takes to make the right decisions and reform Australia's tax system. You would increase the level of employment and get people back to work simply by that one significant change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that it is a very complicated debate for people to understand, and the Government likes to keep it as complicated as possible. It wants to sit back and use the reputation the Treasury has in the community as a basis for attacking the coalition's package. Let me say in regard to that minute that you referred to at Question Time, Treasurer, that I stand by what I said. The truth is that your response&mdash;that this was a minor matter and it was just cleaning up the presentation of a table&mdash;just shows you to what minutia you were prepared to go to get a document that suited your political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package provides real benefits. People can look at the Treasury documents and see the analysis that the Government has provided, but they should know that that is not the only source of advice that the Government has had. In fact, the Prime Minister recently hand-picked a new senior economic adviser for himself in his own office&mdash;one of the top honchos in economic advice for the Prime Minister. He went on the public record in December. Do honourable members know what he said about Fightback? He said that it was visionary. He said that there was no point attacking Fightback on the arithmetic. He said that those on low incomes were adequately compensated, as far as he could see, as a result of Fightback. He said that the abolition of payroll tax would be, generally speaking, a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put this question to the Prime Minister yesterday: `Look, you have two sources of advice: one from Treasury and another from this Dr Edwards, and Dr Edwards thinks Fightback is pretty good. What do you say?'. What was the Prime Minister's answer? He said, `I was not paying him then'. Does that not say it all: `He wasn't in my pocket when he gave that advice about the benefits of Fightback'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package is paid for. The Government's package is put on the national Bankcard, and is not paid for.

They care nothing for that because they hold to their breast this ridiculous document that was produced late last year. Those opposite will contemplate no criticism, no debate, about their cherished values. This is not what political debate in Australia is about, has been about or what those opposite have purported it to be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has decided that the detailed arguments will be too complex for anyone to understand and, therefore, the best thing to do is simply to dismiss its critics and blackguard those who are its detractors. Mr Kitney goes on to make the very important point that, in doing so, Dr Hewson is backing down from a commitment he made in an interview with that same newspaper only a couple of weeks ago when he said that if it were shown that members of the Opposition had underestimated the extent of their bracket creep compensation, then they would increase the size of the tax cuts in order to make up for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They now walk away from that because it does not suit them. It does not suit them to enter into this debate. All they want to do is savagely attack the anonymous authors, the professional authors, of this document because that is what they think is the best political tactic. To hell with what it means in moral terms; to hell with what it means in terms of the conduct of political debate in this country. Those opposite care nothing. They will do anything in order to try to maintain the lie, the deception, of their Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they are smarting about today&mdash;and they have been smarting about it for the last 24 hours&mdash;is that the people of Australia now know that 70 per cent of households in Australia will be worse off, 80 per cent of taxpayers will be worse off, because they got their numbers wrong and they have not provided the promised compensation. To put this in simple terms: in order to get the revenue from the GST, the food and clothing tax, every man, woman and child in Australia would need to be taxed $23 a week. The Opposition said, `But we will not leave you out of pocket because, through a variety of means&mdash;tax cuts, increases in family payments and other devices&mdash;we will ensure that you have the money in your pocket to pay that $23, on average'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reveals that, through their money laundering devices, through the amazing fiscal puzzle that they have invented, it does not add up. People are out of pocket by quite significant amounts in some cases. That is what they do not like. So, rather than dealing with the criticism, they will simply try to savage the reputations of those who have dared to raise any questions about their credibility or the credibility of the authors of their document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition started by saying that in one of the documents&mdash;document 8, I think&mdash;there was a revelation that bracket creep had been estimated by the Australian Taxation Office as being $3 billion. What happened was that the Tax Office and the Treasury took the revenue items from the Opposition's package, one of which was entitled `Tax bracket creep', for which it had $2.9 billion in the third year. The Tax Office made the estimate on the basis of the assumptions&mdash;that is, the 3.5 per cent increase in earnings&mdash;and got a broadly similar figure of $3 billion. But then<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the Opposition did not go to further documents. At document 20, the Treasury people who undertook this analysis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition document estimates revenue from fiscal drag based on an assumed 3.5 per cent annual growth in average earnings. Indexation of the income tax scales requires that they be adjusted by the rate of inflation, rather than the growth in average earnings. The indexation based taxation cuts presented in Table 2 would cost $4.2 billion in 1991 values. This compares with a figure of $2.9 billion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or $3 billion, in accordance with the other calculations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which is the Opposition's estimate of revenue available from bracket creep.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is not a matter of returning revenue you have collected; it is a matter of how much you have to give back to households for the effect of inflation on the tax scales taking people into higher tax brackets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is spelt out in such exquisite detail in these documents that those in the Opposition could not have failed to see it. Those opposite are trying to concoct this argument and concoct a fact which comes from the paucity and inconsistency of their own analysis, where they say that earnings are growing by 3.5 per cent per year but inflation from the Murphy model is running along at 6 and 7 per cent. It is the inflation rate coming from the Murphy model&mdash;the Opposition's preferred scenario, which purportedly delivers to it its two million jobs by the turn of the century&mdash;which is savaging the ability of taxpayers to maintain their standard of living. Hence the need to adjust the tax scales in order to keep them in a comparable position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has nothing to do with returning a particular amount of revenue; it has to do with keeping taxpayers in the same position as they would have been in had the tax scales been indexed fully. It is a total furphy for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to run around talking about our policy in relation to indexation of the tax scales or bracket creep. It is the Opposition's document which proposes, as an article of faith&mdash;an article of religion&mdash;to return all of the consequences of bracket creep to the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why was the Treasury not entitled to take them at face value?  When those opposite said they were going to do it, all the Treasury did was make a calculation of what it should be and worked out the amount of tax which would have to be returned or the cost of having to maintain those tax scales in an indexed form. So if anyone has been caught out, it is the Opposition, for the poor methodology and the poor analysis it has undertaken in relation to its own document. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, of course, flattered that the Labor Party, which is supposed to be in government in this country, has, instead of governing the country for the last two weeks, even having introduced its own so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement, spent nearly all of the time, all of its efforts, all of its hours of work concentrating on the Opposition. All I can say is that we are very flattered. The Government really thinks we are worth worrying about, and it is right; it is absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this so-called Treasury work. The point here is not that the Treasury itself is the villain in the piece; it is the Ministers&mdash;Treasurer after Treasurer, including one of them who is sitting here and who was sacked not that long ago&mdash;who have been going around trying to force the Treasury into drawing conclusions that are inimical to the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The now Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) when Treasurer put out this great press release about the terrible effects on inflation of the coalition's Fightback package, when he knew all along, at the time he put out that press release, that the CPI impact according to the Treasury's own analysis was 3.9 per cent. He just happened, in that press release, to ignore that simple piece of information he had already been given by the Treasury. Wow! What integrity he has! What an honest man! How honest and honourable he is! There he is, Mr Deputy Speaker: Mogadon Man over there is certainly not Integrity Man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we actually have a look at this package itself, we find the interesting thing about the Government's response to the package&mdash;and one would think it would worry about its `One Job, One Nation' package, not about the coalition the whole time&mdash;is that it applies one set of assumptions and standards to us and a completely different set of assumptions to its own `One Nation, One Job' package. It is like somebody holding up a watermelon and saying that his egg is bigger than someone else's, and the other person saying, `But hang on, that's a watermelon, not an egg', and the Government saying, `No, its not, that great big green thing here, which is red inside, is also an egg, and ours is bigger than yours'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple proposition is that the Government uses one set of assumptions for its `One Job, One Nation' package and it uses a completely different set of assumptions for ours. When we ask the Government members if they will test their `One Nation, One Job' package against the assumptions they apply to the Fightback package, they will not do it. Of course they will not do it, because the results would be bitter and nasty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we really want to look at this debate intelligently we have to argue that the assumptions used in comparing the packages should be the same. We cannot use different assumptions&mdash;watermelons and eggs&mdash;and expect people to draw an intelligent conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the One Nation package. For 1993-94&mdash;the Government's so-called scenario&mdash;it estimates a CPI increase of 3 1/2 per cent. When it does the so-called analysis, the Treasurer's office analysis of the Fightback package, the assumption is that GDP growth will be nought per cent. But when we actually look at scenario C, which it uses when it suits it, we find that that scenario provides for some growth in the economy in that period. But the Government does not use scenario C when it comes to GDP growth; it uses nought per cent. It uses 3 1/2 per cent for One Nation. The fact is that the assumptions are all different. In the Government's estimates of inflation in `One Nation, One Job', the estimate for 1993-94 is 3 3/4per cent and around 3 1/2 per cent beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when the Government talks about the Fightback package, suddenly the picture is different. Even excluding the effect of the GST, the Government's estimate for the growth of CPI is something like 7 per cent. Come on! The public can see through that. That is the most outrageous way of trying to compare and analyse different documents. One would have thought that the basic principle of equity here was that one compared like with like on the same assumption. That is simple; it is obvious, but apparently the Government will not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why will the Government not put the One Nation package through the same analysis that it put the Fightback package through? The answer to that is perfectly obvious. Central to this argument is the great debate about bracket creep, and I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) explained that very well. Here the Government is taking the Opposition's figure and distributes $3 billion-worth of benefits from bracket creep, but it says that the cost to the community of bracket creep will be $4.2 billion. Where did the Government get $4.2 billion from?  Presumably the Government based that figure on scenario C and on the assumption of a 7 per cent CPI figure, although one can only assume that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the figure that the Fightback program was based on; it is based for that period on around 3.5 per cent. However, the Government based it on a completely different figure and is left with a $1.2 billion gap, which the Government cannot explain and which the Treasurer, for all his ranting and raving about how unfair the world is to him&mdash;one of the co-conspirators to the worst recession in Australia for 60 years; he has good reason to complain, I suppose&mdash;did not explain during Question Time and throughout his speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one compares like with like, one can get some substantially different figures. Before I go on to that, I will make this point about scenario C, because much of the Government's argument in relation to Fightback is based on this analysis of so-called scenario C. Scenario C is based on the Murphy model, but what did the Treasury say about the Murphy model? It said that models such as the Murphy model are not well suited to assessing the effects of structural changes such as comprise the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Treasury said, so why does the Government base its critique of the Fightback package on a Murphy model which the Treasury has told it should not and could not be done? In a minute to Dr Parkinson from the Treasury, one sees the same thing repeated again: the changes in the tax mix, including the introduction of the GST, are not included in scenario C. Steve Davis from the Department of Finance tells me that he has spoken with Mr Murphy who confirmed that scenario C does not model the impact of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the basis of the Government's critique of the Fightback package&mdash;scenario C, the Murphy model, when it has been told by the Department that it is not applicable and yet you say the Government decided it was going to use it because it suited it. Therefore scenario C does not consider the possibility of subsequent flow-on effects to wages and economic variables and so on. This is all in the Treasury papers which, when one reads them properly, attack the Government's very analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the most extraordinary efforts by any political party that I have ever seen. The Government has said scenario C is our analysis. Scenario C is what it says it is; it is a scenario; that is all it is. It is not a prediction of what the outcomes from the implementation of the Fightback package will be. We have said that all along, right from the word go. However, the Government has decided to use it just when it happens to suit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which I must admit is richly ironic is the way the Labor Party makes such a big thing about handing back bracket creep. Suddenly the Government has discovered this as an issue, having been in office for nine years, and in nine years there was $22 billion there in bracket creep still waiting to be handed back to the Australian community. What did Senator Button say about that yesterday when he was asked about the handing back of bracket creep and whether the One Nation package would give back or not give back bracket creep? Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question was whether this puts back anything lost by bracket creep over the years to the taxpayer, as distinct from every other government in the history of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Button was asked whether or not the One Nation package gives back bracket creep, he said, `No, it does not'. I thought Senator Button made the point pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not intend to give back bracket creep. You never did intend to give back bracket creep. We have said that we will give back bracket creep fully every year for three years. Your basic argument is utterly incredible. On the basis of your argument, you owe the Australian public $22 billion. When are you going to pay up?  It is a nonsense because, of course, you cannot pay. But do not judge others by standards that you do not apply to yourselves. The public will not be convinced. </PARA>

But a bit later we had the Scullin Government&mdash;and along came the Great Depression. That Government was thrown out because it bankrupted the country. Then we had the Chifley Government, which was thrown out because it tried to nationalise the banks and pocket the savings of ordinary Australians; that was the end of it. Then we had the Whitlam Government, which was thrown out for bankrupting the economy again. Then we had the Hawke-Keating Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is basically an attempt by the Opposition to get the Australian people to believe that there has been political interference in an analysis of the distributional effects of its GST proposals. Members of the Opposition do not like this. In fact, they are horrified by it because it exposes what the distributional effects of their proposals would be. According to this analysis, the overall impact of the Opposition's proposals to impose a GST and make various other expenditure cuts and tax cuts would be to make the great majority of Australian people worse off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This analysis is not the Government's analysis. We absolutely refute the suggestion&mdash;indeed, the accusation&mdash;coming from the Opposition, which is included in this censure motion on the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), that the Government has politically manipulated these analyses by the Treasury and the Department of Finance. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not one skerrick of evidence to show that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debate yesterday the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) alleged he had caught the Government red-handed. He talked about tables 1 and 2 having been changed&mdash;as someone in your office requested in a note to the Treasurer. Today the Treasurer clearly explained what was involved in that. It was merely a presentational change designed to ensure that the table properly reflected the figuring in a way which would advantage the Opposition, to give a fair interpretation of the actual situation. It was an absurd suggestion to argue that there had been political interference. There is no evidence of that in any shape or form in any of this documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is running scared and ignoring the fact that the Finance Department and the Treasury have found that there is a $4 billion hole in the funding of its program. That is a massive shortfall in the funding and it means that the Opposition cannot possibly meet the compensation that it said it would pay if it were to have a fully-funded program&mdash;as it says it does. The Opposition simply ignores all that and sweeps it under the carpet as being some sort of political calculation by the Department of Finance and the Treasury. Let us get quite clear what is being said in respect of that and the distributional analysis. The Opposition is saying that the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, full of people who are dedicated public servants, who have no history in any way of politically favouring any particular side of this Parliament, have engaged in an outright conspiracy with the Government to produce distorted figures to mislead the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an incredible accusation to make against this array of dedicated public servants to say that they have knuckled under to the Government when there is no evidence whatever that there has been any pressure put on them by the Government, nor any evidence that they have in any way manipulated the figuring to produce outcomes which would favour the Government. It is an unbelievably disgraceful accusation by a group of people who must be incredibly worried about the position they find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition were in government, could you imagine what it would be doing in terms of political interference itself? It has told the world, `These people are not to be trusted. These are people who politically manipulate figures'. Could you imagine how it would browbeat those people if it got into government? What kind of distorted figuring could we expect from it in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would probably seek to change a lot of the current hierarchy, having falsely accused them of a crime they have never committed. It is an extraordinarily outrageous position for an alternative government to be putting to the people of Australia that the key economic departments of this country cannot be trusted and are absolutely in league with the Government in misleading the Australian people. Opposition members ought to be ashamed of themselves. That accusation itself coming from the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and all those behind them should disqualify them from any right to hold office in this country. None of those people should have any right to hold office in this country when they have engaged in such disgraceful behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax bracket creep is the heart of the issue in this distributional analysis, although certainly not the only point. When the Opposition did its own calculations of tax bracket creep it got it fundamentally wrong in concept. It has fundamentally failed to understand it in concept. Tax bracket creep is not about adjusting the tax scales for increases in wages or incomes; it is about adjusting them for inflation. But the Opposition adjusted them for the increase in wages&mdash;that is, 3 1/2 per cent. The Opposition said that because wages have increased 3 1/2 per cent, we have to adjust the scales by 3 1/2 for wages. But that is not the concept of tax bracket creep, as the Treasurer has explained time and time again in Question Time to a bunch of thickheads opposite&mdash;particularly the shadow Treasurer. Page 2 of Appendix 2 of Treasury's document 20 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition document estimates revenue from fiscal drag based on an assumed 3.5 per cent annual growth in average earnings. Indexation of the income tax scales requires that they be adjusted by the rate of inflation rather than growth in average earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition got it wrong in concept. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The indexation based tax cuts presented in Table 2 would cost about $4.2b.</PARA>
<PARA>Previous to that, Treasury made the point that the index that you would have to use looking at the Opposition document is that which comes from scenario C. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scenario C is described in favourable terms. The only other CPI figures produced in the documents are for Scenarios A and B, which are rejected as unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA>What else was the Treasury to take? It was trying to work off your whole basis of calculation. Everything was modelled on how you went about it. When Treasury was looking for another inflation figure, did you want it to invent one or dream up a figure? You got the concept wrong. Should the Treasury have dreamed up an inflation figure and said, `We will assume X figure'? Treasury looked through your material to find what your inflation figure was. The only inflation figure Treasury could find was the one in scenario C, which was described, as Treasury says, in favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How favourable was it? The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said, `It is a terrible thing to say that we are attached to that'. Page 30 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third scenario (High Road) shows the effects of a program of reform such as that outlined in this document.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not some endorsement of scenario C, or some kind of an indication of acceptance that that represents something of the kind that is in the Opposition's Fightback proposals, I do not know what is. Quite clearly, it was the only figure that could be used. So that is the figure that has been used. It is the appropriate figure to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not like the outcome. We can see that. You hate the outcome. It destroys what you were trying to put over the Australian people to get them to believe that every Australian was a winner. You had this increase in tax and these expenditure cuts. You moved some other taxes and you moved it all around&mdash;this big money laundering exercise, as the Treasurer has said, which all balanced out. At the end of all that, you said, `Everybody is a winner'. Terrific! We all think it would be marvellous if you could produce that but, on the face of it, it seems most implausible. When you do the analysis properly using your own figures in terms of what the wages figure would be under your proposals, and what the inflation figures would be, what comes out? At least 70 per cent of wage and salary earners are worse off, and 60 per cent of self-employed people and farmers are worse off&mdash;using the only kind of analysis which an independent analyst could use. They were not going to dream up any other figures. They were going to do the thing properly. When they did it properly, that is what they came up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury added the point that if you took the commitment to road user charging, which is a commitment given by the Opposition as something it would do down the track, you would have another burden on the consumers and you would have 80 per cent of wage and salary earners worse off and 70 per cent of the self-employed people and farmers worse off. You are committed to that road user charge. Your Leader has made it absolutely clear in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> that that is something you are absolutely going to do. Do not tell us that this is not part of your scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing the exercise properly, you do not only take account of tax bracket creep; you have to put in all other things that you forgot to include. What did the Opposition do when it did its analysis of what should be in this package? It showed that it had, to say the least, a very biased view of what should be included in the analysis to see who is better off and who is worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition left out a whole host of areas which should have been included. In effect, it put in all the goodies and left out all the nasties. When the Opposition was doing its distribution to households to show that everyone is going to be better off, it included the GST at 15 per cent, removal of the wholesale sales tax, removal of payroll tax, removal of the fuel excise, faster phase-down of customs duties and lower State franchise fees. Of course, apart from the GST, that all helps: all the personal income tax cuts,  GST tax credits, increases in family allowances and health tax credits. So apart from the GST it is shown as all pluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this package is full of minuses. It is full of attacks on people, and none of those got included, apart from the GST. W<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>hen we look at the sorts of things that should be included, we get an entirely different picture. We get the kind of picture that comes out of the Treasury analysis. Treasury went back and said, `We should include other things which can be attributed to households and which are part of this package'. So it included the introduction of the proposed family income test for dependent spouse rebate; lowering the income tax threshold for family allowance; removing Austudy where the present eligibility is less than $30 a week; introducing a Medicare levy surcharge for higher income groups; tightening the income and assets test for pensions, family allowances, FAS, Austudy and junior Job Search allowance; a new parental income and assets test relating to 20-year-old Job Search allowance recipients living at home; and removal of the sole parent pension where the child was aged 12 or over. Treasury was able to distribute all of those, and it did. Of course, that was the proper thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those things has been put in the Opposition's distribution to households, but they are part of the package. It is a complete attempt to be fraudulent in terms of what the distributional analysis would be. A whole host of nasties, which the Opposition did not bother to explain to the Australian people, should have been included in the distribution. Of course, some other things were not able to be taken into account, such as $6 1/2 billion worth of expenditure cuts which could not be distributed. That is an enormous amount of expenditure cuts that could not be distributed to households. The Opposition approach, of course, was to give no distribution of any of these expenditure cuts. It said, `We distributed what we could'. When we do that and take account of the tax bracket creep, of course, we get a much different picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a tremendously important debate. It is a censure on a Treasurer for telling the truth. It is a censure on the Treasurer for producing to the House a vast array of documentation which has come to the Government undoctored and unsponsored by us. It was certainly asked for by us, and appropriately so, in accordance with the procedures that have been adopted by governments over the years, such as the Fraser Government and other governments from the other side of politics, as well as this Government, in terms of getting Opposition proposals costed.

The Treasury has devised a set of assumptions which suit us right down to the ground, and this is the outcome. But, oh no, Keating's One Nation statement is to be untouched.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance and the Treasurer have a hide indeed to come in sheltering behind this huge document. It is a large document;  I will concede that much. It is a heavy, qualified document. It is a document and a process that you will not apply to your treatment of this economy; your treatment of the issue of bracket creep over the last 8 1/2 to nine years; and your treatment of future projections so far as your One Nation statement is concerned and what that might well be doing to interest rates in the near and longer term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the House is, indeed, not only a censure motion but also an amendment moved by the fourth Treasurer this country has had in less than 12 months. Remember that we had Treasurer Keating. He was the one who said that he would bring home the bacon and that this is the recession we had to have. We then had Treasurer Kerin. He was the one who completely fell over in a press conference on various matters relating to the economy. We then had Treasurer Willis. He was dispatched after some four weeks. Now, of course, we have Treasurer Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's amendment to our censure motion is interesting. The first point reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its disgraceful and unjustified attacks upon important public institutions. I just happen to have in my hand a copy of the speech of the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the National Press Club on Tuesday, 22 October 1991. It is the one that he made about the Commonwealth and the States and the November Special Premiers Conference. We would have to concede that the Premiers Conference is somewhat of an institution. We might not like it, we might not agree with much of its deliberations&mdash;its convoluted deliberations&mdash;but it is an institution. So powerful was the attack of then backbencher Keating on that whole process that he happened to knock off that November Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that that is not a bad achievement from the backbench against a weakened Prime Minister. But it just exposes the hypocrisy of this Prime Minister coming in here after being advised by his minders overnight, `Lift your game. Get it up onto the high ground. Do not go on with any more miming at the dispatch box'. So he came in here to do that, and he made himself a complete hypocrite in the process. The second part of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its misleading an incompetently costed Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) caught out the Treasurer in absolute terms on that particular score. The Fightback package stands up. It has survived well and clearly the hit-back by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scud missile launched in the form of this huge briefing paper has backfired on the Government and, indeed, the people of Australia know exactly where they will cast their votes in respect of job creation, less government, less taxation, more incentive and more productivity at the next Federal election. The third part of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its advocacy of a package which massively disadvantages low income earners but benefits high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>This package is progressive. The Government's One Nation package is regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, I might add that our treatment of pensioners is indeed very generous. It is a matter that I discussed with pension organisations this morning. They conceded that the inflation rate would be an increase, going by these papers, of 3.9 per cent. But guess what we are doing for pensioners under Fightback. We are bringing in an 8 per cent increase, twice the one-off adjustment, as part of the Fightback and GST approach so that pensioners will better off. Even the Government and the papers tabled concede that pensioners will be better off under our approach. We are not disadvantaging pensioners; we are giving them an 8 per cent increase in the age pension and the service pension. Let no-one forget that. The fourth point of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its advocacy of a medical system which would place the health of the bulk of the Australian population hostage to their purse.</PARA>
<PARA>Many Australians today, as the Minister for Finance would probably admit if he were honest, are in horrible queues for hip replacements and in huge queues for a range of other operations which are not available to them under the current health policies of this Government. The situation has reached a stage where there is queue jumping of a very ugly kind taking place because the Government has failed in the health policy task that should have been delivered by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Fightback does is tilt the system back towards the private sector unashamedly and gives people a fair go and an incentive to look after their health insurance needs and to provide for their health care. Indeed, it gives them access to the private and public hospital system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point in the amendment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its failure to address the employment, education and training needs of Australia's young people;</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear cut. We were the ones who put education on the national agenda with the contributions to the Fightback package by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). It is an additional $3 billion of expenditure by the year 2000. It is an increase in the isolated children's allowance to a more specific level, which the Government was forced to match as it stole another part of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the future of Australia, as we look towards the twenty-first century, is going to depend on many things. In past centuries it was the power of the arrow and the gun. In more recent decades it has been the power of commerce. Japan and other trading nations have shown since World War II  how effective that can be for their standard of living. As we look towards the twenty-first century, I suggest it is going to be more associated with the power of knowledge and the ability to adapt technology advance to the nation's progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ill becomes the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is meant to have certain portfolio responsibilities in the area of technology, to attack these comments. The reality is that, unless we lift our game on the education front, Australia is going to severely crimp its economic performance in the first quarter of the next century. We must lift our game on the education front. Fightback does that in very clear-cut terms in a way which the Government has conceded by trying to match aspects of it. The sixth point in the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its deceitful estimates of employment growth under its proposition;</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Fightback is absolute in terms of that. Under Fightback we abolish payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under One Nation crippling levels of payroll tax, $6 billion, will be imposed on the payrolls of many businesses right around Australia. Many individual farmers, including, as the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) points out, even the vegetable growers at Bowen, will be greatly helped by the elimination of payroll tax and the boost that that will effectively provide for employment. The seventh point is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its deliberate persecution of those who are social security and unemployment beneficiaries;</PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, we propose an 8 per cent increase in the age pension, an 8 per cent increase in the service pension and a 6 per cent increase for all other beneficiaries specifically provided for under Fightback. The eighth point is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its failure to address the infrastructure requirements of micro economic reform programs</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and many others have charted the course in terms of shipping and waterfront reform, and in terms of land transport reform. This Government has tinkered in respect of the micro reform agenda. There has been minuscule progress over the last eight to nine years. Alternatively, we mean business in our proposals in those key areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have the hide of the Government to include in its amendment the following point, No.9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its complete failure to review business taxation on investment critical to encouraging employment creating growth. </PARA>
<PARA>We are removing $20 billion worth of taxes on business inputs to tilt the playing field back in favour of our hard pressed exporters to give them a fair go and to boost our job creation. Yet the Government is saying that we are doing nothing to put down the right tax framework for this nation to facilitate job creation, to facilitate productivity and to facilitate a boost to our economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the House that clearly the amendment moved by the Government is unacceptable to the coalition, it is unacceptable to the nation and it does not reflect the fundamentals of the Fightback package, and is totally rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is time to break off from all the economic jargon and come back to another aspect of the Prime Minister's curious attack in Question Time which was part of the precursor to this censure motion moved so ably by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Honourable members will recall the Prime Minister carrying on as if he has never in his public life criticised the media; he has never criticised institutions; and he has never criticised individuals outside the House of Representatives and the Senate chamber who would not have a right of reply. I draw the attention of the House to a quote of 12 December 1990 when the present Prime Minister was attending an Australian Mining Industry Council function. He took his venom out on waiting journalists as he left the AMIC meeting in Canberra, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got nothing to say to you. I can't trust the Australian media with a sensible conversation. So be frivolous&mdash;and disappear.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of Prime Minister Keating, this holier than thou Prime Minister Keating, this man who has the audacity to reflect on the coalition for alleged attacks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the issue of sales tax. Many people do not realise that there is actually a tax on services administered by this Government today. It is a 20 per cent sales tax on all freight services, and it is one that is built in and adds to the tyranny of distance in the distribution of commodities right across Australia, particularly to Western Australia. One Nation retains sales tax on freight services at 20 per cent. Fightback removes all sales tax on freight services and paves the way for the lowering of the tyranny of distance and the cost tag associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take another aspect of sales tax. Dr John Bell of Senator Button's Department spelt out very clearly last year that sales tax, as it is currently structured, constitutes a 5 per cent disadvantage to all exporters of products to the world and particularly to Asia. One Nation retains the 5 per cent sales tax disadvantage on our exporters, tilting the playing field against our exporters. Fightback removes the sales tax 5 per cent disadvantage factor, which was put forward in the report produced by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs years ago when he was chairman of a committee but never acted on by the Government. We act on it, we adopt it and we do it in a very progressive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very interesting comparison on fuel excise tax. Australian motorists and various other users of fuel in Australia pay some $6.6 billion of fuel excise taxes each year. That is up from the $1 billion per year motorists were paying at the start of the Labor Government's term. What happens to fuel excise taxes under these two packages? Under the `One Nation, One Job' Keating package, fuel excise taxes and all their anomalies are retained in their entirety. The 26c a litre on petrol and diesel is fully retained, as it is on avgas, and it is crippling transport industries across Australia. Fightback will abolish all diesel fuel excise, all petrol fuel excise and all avgas fuel excise, and help turn around this economy and put the capital `D' back into `decentralisation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time we had a proper and fair debate on the comparisons between the two packages, the Fightback package and the One Nation package.

Obviously, they will be two different statistics. Obviously, the Treasury, having had an opportunity to examine those figures, came to the conclusion that any Treasury would when examining the assumptions in the Fightback package. The fact that members of the Opposition have a disagreement with the Treasury is the reason they are here today putting forward the proposition that the Treasurer ought to be censured.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not want to deal just with the issues presented in the Opposition's censure motion because, as I said, they are issues that can be dealt with in two or three minutes. The measures are all there to see. The analysis is all there to see. As far as the public is concerned there is a massive piece of Treasury analysis&mdash;careful analysis&mdash;of the Fightback package. Various conclusions have been arrived at about it. Indeed, the Department of Finance has advised the Opposition that, if it were to proceed with suggestions the Department made, it may indeed get better savings than from the propositions it has put forward. That Department has identified a number of other people who, in the simplest possible way, would be beneficiaries of the Fightback package, although they are by no means a majority. However, it has torn to pieces the various examples utilised by the Opposition in its overall claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to do a political exercise on the Fightback package, which now scarcely seems sensible in the context that it is of its own volition leaking like a sieve, we would have a number of other conclusions to make about that package, a number of other expenditure estimates and the like to challenge, and a whole raft of policy decisions to pick up and deal with&mdash;as to whether or not particular savings are achieved and whether a particular activity would be acceptable as a piece of public policy. We do not have to do that in the context of this debate except in so far as we have taken the debate on in our own amendment, as moved by the Treasurer, which deals with the elements of unfairness in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a general proposition about censure motions in this place. The Opposition has for virtually the life of this Government degraded the process of the censure motion by its extraordinary overuse of it as a tactic. That degrading of what ought to be a serious part of the parliamentary process, a serious part of parliament's scrutiny of the Executive, the Opposition has now taken to the nth degree since the Parliament was recalled for this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third or fourth censure motion that we have had in about six days of sittings. That represents more than one censure motion every couple of days. That is a ludicrous use of that tool. Fortunately for the good governance of the nation, we do not take the attitude to censure motions that Menzies took when he was Prime Minister. When Menzies was Prime Minister and a censure motion was moved he would shut the House down. He would say, `Okay, a motion has been moved in the House that there is no confidence in this Government. That is a serious motion, to be dealt with by serious people. We will now close the House. It will be resumed at this time tomorrow, when we will have a debate on that subject'. That debate would run for a couple of days. Of course, the Opposition of the day, which happened to be ourselves, would move these motions&mdash;if we moved them at all&mdash;once or twice in the period of a parliament. It was not a process that was abused. When we did it it was a serious proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we now have a new tactic added to the censure motion. To this point by and large the censure motion has been used by the Opposition to get some attention in the course of the day to the complaints that it has from time to time about government or its desire to advocate this or that aspect of its own policy. To this point in time that is the way in which the Opposition has used a censure motion. What we have now is a new tactic. The censure motion is now a means to avoid Question Time. There cannot be any doubt about that. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has suffered a massive lambasting in Question Time over the last couple of weeks. That has been part of a process which has turned his political standing in this community on its head. He has acknowledged that process by a desire to avoid Question Time as much as he possibly can. Of course, these days Question Time is broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great hue and cry was made by members of the Opposition a little while ago when we suggested that, to get an effective Question Time going, rather than have a Question Time devoted each day, effectively at the end of the day, to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, we have a scrutiny of a totality of Government departments. We put that forward at the time in keeping with what appeared to be a point of view put forward by the Leader of the Opposition that he wished Question Time to become an opportunity for a scrutiny of Government activity. That was rejected by the Opposition out of hand. Because we take the view that when major Standing Orders proposals are to be changed we ought not to do that without the consensus of the Opposition, we dropped it and proceeded with it no further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we find ourselves in the oddball situation of the type of Question Time that honourable members opposite wished to see continued now being rejected by them. They do not want a Question Time at all. They do not want an opportunity for members of parliament on both sides of the House to ask questions of the Government on Government policy and alternative propositions to Government policy to see whether they wish to adopt them and what the arguments are for not adopting them. Honourable members opposite do not want to go through with that. They want to hide from that process. They are scurrying away from scrutiny, effectively, of their own policies in the process. They have said, `We have this great initiative out there in the community and that is what the community ought to commit itself to but, for God's sake, do not analyse it and, particularly, do not have that proposition analysed in the parliamentary forum'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not like to run away from censure motions. We do not take much notice of honourable members who stand up and move motions to the effect that they want this or that Minister to explain this or that. We may or may not decide to take those motions on. However, it is a bad thing for a government to refuse a censure motion when it is moved by the Opposition. But we are not going to persist in this situation in which we have a censure motion every second day which effectively eliminates Question Time on those days, which is the proposition that we are now being invited to entertain by the Opposition Leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is going right for the Leader of the Opposition. Question Time is not going right for him. Campaign launches are not going right for him. Honourable members will recollect that last weekend they heard that Mr Wills lived in the electorate and his factory was in the electorate; he employed people in the electorate: he was Mr Wills. However, the factory is not in the electorate. He does not live in the electorate. Perhaps he employs one or two people from the electorate. He is not Mr Wills. There is an interesting contrast to the political handling and massaging of that exercise as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. It is the only time I have ever seen somebody launch a by-election campaign from Opposition on the grounds that, `The Government is going to win the seat. We will let the Government win it. That's fine'. We have the candidate standing up and saying, `I desperately do not want to win this seat'. </PARA>

Well might he not wish to enter this place where he will see exposed from day to day the propositions that the Opposition has been putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment to the censure motion has, as its sustaining base, two things. The first is the analysis provided by the Treasury and the Department of Finance of the Opposition's package, the first element of which analysis shows that there is a $4 billion hole in the package. That $4 billion hole is the net savings that are taken from the Opposition's cutbacks to public outlays. The net savings are $4 billion short and, basically, the net savings are there to pay for the taxation handback to the general public. The second element is a distributional analysis; that is, who does and who does not benefit from this scheme. The unquestioned result of that Treasury analysis is that the vast bulk of the general public does not benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take this matter a point further. The second part of our attack, upon which our amendment is based, is that Fightback is totally shoddy public policy. The problem with Fightback is that it hides a multitude of sins. Behind the drama, behind an attempt to impose a 15 per cent across the board consumption tax on the Australian community, rides a raft of policy assumptions and activities that amount to major social attack on the community, including a total dismantling of the medical system in a way which will cause, amongst other things, a major cost blow-out which will be sustained by ordinary citizens in this country paying out massive additional amounts for medical insurance. What an irony it is that the US presidential election is increasingly beginning to focus on a couple of issues, one being the creation of a decent medical system for the American community somewhat, according to some advocates, along the lines of the Australian system, yet the Opposition is adopting a position on Medicare which&mdash;</PARA>

It was the one thing that stuck in the minds of members of the Australian public at the end of last year when Fightback was launched. I am sure that, had those opposite done a survey of the Australian population&mdash;in fact, we have done surveys&mdash;they would have found that members of the public did not have a clue, although they are beginning to get one, about the 15 per cent consumption tax, but that they knew all about those two million jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

We can understand why he wants to run away from Question Time and to move motions such as this. But we will not permit him to run away from Question Time any more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I have seen anything quite so breathtaking in its gall and hypocrisy as the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Question Time today in posing as the wounded, indignant and hurt defender of public institutions, as the friend of those whose reputation is traduced by somebody under the cover of parliamentary privilege and as the upholder of the honourable and correct thing to do so far as public life is concerned and the use of the privilege of being a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody can expect to be a major player in Australian public life without expecting a large amount of criticism. By and large, I have no argument at all with the proposition of the Prime Minister that, if we give a bit in this game, we have to be willing to take a bit. That applies to those on this side as much as it does to those on the other side. But I find it quite extraordinary that the current Prime Minister&mdash;of all people&mdash;should set himself up as a defender of the oppressed bureaucracy, the archprotector of those in the community who have had their character assailed by people under cover of parliamentary privilege. In my remarks I want to move to a number of examples to show that, of all the people who sit in the Parliament at present, no one has been more guilty of undermining public institutions than the present Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that, I want specifically to rebut something which has underlain the whole of this debate about the role of the Federal Treasury. In doing so, I have to take issue with some public comments made by John Stone, who served me with great professionalism when he was Secretary to the Treasury between 1978 and 1983. I refer specifically to Mr Stone's claim that it was the invariable practice of the Treasury to cost the election policies of the opposition. I have to say for the record that that is incorrect. In 1983, when the opposition policy being costed was the policy on which the Hawke-Keating Government was elected and when the current Prime Minister was the shadow Treasurer, I must inform the House that I scrupulously observed what I then understood to be the convention of this country&mdash;that a government does not use the Public Service to cost the election policies of its opponents during election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I can inform the House that the economic policy of the then opposition was costed in my office, as Treasurer, by the now Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who was then an economic adviser to me, by Jon Craig, who is now a senior economic adviser to our present Leader and who is on secondment to my office from the Treasury, and by Mr Ted Sieper, who was an economic adviser to the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. I do not talk about other examples;  I simply make the point for the record that this idea that the Treasury has always been used to cost the proposals of the opposition side of politics is incorrect. I thought it desirable for the record that that point be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the present Prime Minister. Let me return to this outrageous howl of indignation that the Prime Minister threw out in Question Time today about how terrible it was for the Opposition to attack any public institution, how scrupulous he was in preserving and defending their independence and how wrong it was for anybody on this side of the House ever to express any criticism of the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal, first of all, with the media. It is one of the notorious facts of political life in this country that the great media upheaval of the 1980s in Australia&mdash;which cost the ordinary Australian very dearly and resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs in the media industry in Australia&mdash;was in fact the direct product of the manic determination of the present Prime Minister to destroy the authority and influence of the Fairfax media empire during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one fact of media policy in this country, it is that the current media set-up that we have in this country is essentially the product of the Keating compromise that was put forward in the mid-1980s&mdash;born of the hatred of the Fairfax papers by the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party because the Fairfax newspapers had dared to expose the corruption of the Wran-Unsworth era in New South Wales. </PARA>

The present Prime Minister was thwarted on that occasion by the former Minister for Communications, the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). So the present Prime Minister came up with his compromise: to introduce the prohibition of cross-media ownership.

He had no respect for him at all.

What greater insult could you possibly direct at an institution like the Reserve Bank of Australia when you are Federal Treasurer than to stand up and say,`You do what I say'?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong in his long, rambling speech seemed to have a fixation with the past of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Is it any wonder when, day after day, the Prime Minister gets up in this House at Question Time and exposes the Opposition's Fightback package for what it really is. That is what this is all about. That is why we are having a censure motion every day. There was one yesterday, another one today and, going on form, there will be another one tomorrow. The censure motion moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House censures the Treasurer for his role in the Government's attempt to grossly distort the benefits provided to Australians by the Coalition's Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not just take the words of the Opposition about the intentions of the Government; let us look at what people in other organisations have had to say about the package. When the Victorian Council of Social Service saw the Fightback package, what did it say? The report of the AAP states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Council of Social Service said today there are winners and losers out of the Opposition's tax package . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council identified some of the losers. It is not hard to identify the winners&mdash;anybody over $90,000 a year will do really well out of the goods and services tax. But the losers are the people who are getting unemployment payments, those who have been out of work for nine months or more who, we are led to believe, will be kicked off unemployment benefits. The Victoria Council of Social Service not only had a go about the end of unemployment benefits, it also criticised the Opposition plan to cut pensions to sole parents as part of the GST package. We can see that the `savings' are supposed to come from unemployment benefits and people on sole parent benefits. The AAP put out a further report on the Victorian Council of Social Service. It is headed `Opposition's Tax Package is Death of Public Housing', and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Executive Director of VCOSS, Mr Robert Hudson said, "The Opposition's tax package proposes slashing Commonwealth public housing funds by 1 billion dlrs a year.</PARA>
<PARA>We can see that when the people in the community start looking at this so-called Fightback package they have a few reservations about it. What did the churches have to say about the package? In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 2 December, under the heading `Churches attack GST for selling out the poor', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two leading Christian churches have voiced misgivings about the federal Coalition's goods and services tax package, questioning its effect on the poor and disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission says at least five aspects of the package need a great deal more scrutiny, while a leading article in the church's newspaper in NSW,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> The Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS>, concludes the less well-off will be the losers from the proposed tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who have a genuine concern for people on low incomes did not need that two-inch thick document from the Treasury to tell the Opposition that, under its proposals, people on low incomes would be a lot worse off and people on high incomes would be advantaged. Let us have a look at the effect this will have on the community. We are talking about public organisations, and I would say that Syntec would be a public organisation. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 4 December, under the banner headline `Interest rates tipped to rise under GST', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prominent economic consultancy Syntec has warned investors that short-term interest rates might double to 16 per cent under a Hewson government as monetary policy was tightened to halt soaring inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Syntec is no friend of the Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is true. Syntec also expresses reservations about the impact of the goods and services tax not only on people on low incomes but on people across the community. What did tourism groups have to say about the goods and services tax? An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 18 December 1991 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia has publicly criticised the Opposition's goods and services tax proposal for its failure to exempt tourism-related items from its proposed 15 per cent tax.</PARA>
<PARA>If people have not noticed, that is our largest industry and it, too, is expressing reservations. It goes on and on. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> dated 12 November, ACOSS states:</PARA>

<PARA>ACOSS is having a go at the goods and services tax. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>What did sporting bodies such as the Confederation of Australian Sport have to say? In an article headed `GST will make administering of sporting bodies harder', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these organisations are stretched for back-room personnel. When the coaches, managers, secretaries and publicity officers have been appointed, the most unpopular job remaining is often that of treasurer. Equally often, those who take on the task are willing work-horses whose enthusiasm outweighs their financial acumen.</PARA>
<PARA>One can imagine secretaries of major sporting organisations around this country having to grapple with the goods and services tax. Once again, they have come out and publicly criticised it. Nick Renton, an actuary, looked at the Opposition's tax package for people who are retired and said that prices will rise but the issue is what compensation is offered. He sums it up in a couple of sentences:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike many other people who may get long-term benefit from the reforms, the retired generation inevitably will experience the worst of both worlds at the start of the new system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Consumption Tax or GST Day, the purchasing power of their accumulated savings will fall dramatically as prices start to rise to reflect the 15 per cent GST.</PARA>
<PARA>These remarks are from just a few public organisations around Australia, which have nothing to do with this Government. People have made up their minds, independent of any outside pressure, and have come out and said much of what the Government is saying and much of what the Treasury is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time yesterday the Prime Minister said that when someone gets up in this House and criticises the Leader of the Opposition or his package the response is predictable: a mouthful of abuse across the table and the attack of public organisations. The censure motion yesterday was about how the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Treasury and the Teachers Federation in New South Wales must have met somewhere and conspired to get the program on the goods and services tax to air in order to bring down the Opposition. When one sits back and analyses what the Leader of the Opposition said in that motion, one has to wonder where he is. He is starting to get noticed in the gallery. In an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> headed `Hewson shoots the messenger', Peter Hartcher, a respected journalist around this place, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are seeing John Hewson under sustained political pressure for the first time since he assumed the job of Opposition Leader nearly two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>Gee, he had a good run last year! The Labor Party had its problems, but it has sorted them out. During that time the Leader of the Opposition just skated through and really did not have to try all that hard but with the present Prime Minister he is under pressure every day&mdash;and it shows. Mr Hartcher continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His reaction is creating the first real wave of doubt about his leadership among his own party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Backbenchers and frontbenchers alike are expressing reservations privately about Hewson's capacity to deal effectively with criticism. One backbencher comments that for Hewson any criticism is a crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of his shadow ministers says he was thunderstruck at the thrust of Hewson's tactics yesterday in dealing with the Treasury analysis of the Opposition's policy proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>That is attacking the messenger, not the figures in the Treasury analysis. Anyone who saw the coalition's proposals, anyone who saw that Fightback was a winner, anyone who saw that Fightback had all the answers and was sure of his sums would not go after the messenger; he would attempt to destroy the Treasury analysis. But that has not been done. In this debate today I have not heard any criticism from members of the Opposition about the Treasury analysis, apart from the fact that it does not agree with their analysis. Of course, if it does not agree with their analysis, then it must be wrong. That is as far as it goes. It never gets into facts and figures; it never attempts to put down the assertions that are made by Treasury and the Department of Finance. </PARA>

For once, an Australian government has said, `We are going to give something to middle income earners'.

Yesterday via the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) the Government was attempting to undermine the coalition's Fightback package in a speech which I then said was full of typical Government&mdash;I stress Government&mdash;half-truths, misinformation and phoney arguments. The Government claimed to be calling on the work of the Treasury, and that, of course, as the honourable member for Swan, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), correctly pointed out, makes this debate a very serious matter. So we now have the opportunity to look at the material, and it is a difficult task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me commence by saying that the Treasury document supports the Opposition's estimate of the initial price impact of the introduction of a goods and services tax. We put that at 4.4 per cent. When the various comments from the Treasury are put together, they come up with a figure of 3.6 per cent. It is an even lower figure than we suggested. Let us have done for all time&mdash;and I say this particularly to those outside listening to this debate&mdash;with people running around saying that the goods and services tax is going to put 15 per cent onto everything in the shop right now. That is absolute rubbish. As I stressed yesterday, we are abolishing a number of taxes, and three big ones in particular&mdash;the wholesale sales tax, the petroleum products tax and the payroll tax. The effect is to significantly lower many prices before the 15 per cent is applied. So the actual inflation effect is 4.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those taxes have both direct and indirect effects. As I stressed, take a carton of milk on the supermarket shelf. Diesel and fuel comes in on the farm and at many different points between the farm gate and the shelf, thereby affecting the cost of production of that item. The abolition of the petrol tax is imperative in a country with distances like Australia's, and that is one of the important things we are doing. The Treasury material supports our estimate of the price impact of the goods and services tax. Let us not lose sight of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let me raise this central question: we get the assertion from the Government that something like 70 per cent of Australian households will be adversely affected by the introduction of this tax, whereas we have claimed that, because of our compensation measures, most households will be better off. How can there be such a wide divergence between Fightback and the Government's claims based on Treasury calculations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline the situation as we see it. In the Government documents, attachment 3 to the speech by the Treasurer, the outstanding category most adversely affected is that of families on $25,000 per annum, or about $500 a week. That is the typical Australian family income&mdash;not the arithmetical average, but the typical Australian family income. As I stressed yesterday, what the Opposition is saying in that regard and has shown to be fully funded is this: a family of husband and wife and two dependent children and on $25,000 are presently paying $4,694 in tax. They will get a tax cut of $1,185, or about $23 a week. There will be an extra $300 on the dependent spouse rebate. We are doubling the family allowance for families receiving an income of under $30,000 a year; we are not doubling it higher up the income scale but doubling it for the lower income families. If there are two children, with the family allowance the family will get an extra $1,040. So there is a total of $2,525 a year extra that that family will receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the interest they receive on any new saving will no longer be subject to tax. They will get an additional $200 tax credit for family private health cover. When child-care decisions are in place, they will access them. The amount spent on consumption by families in that group after taxation must be in the order of $18,000 to $20,000 per annum, so there is an increase of $800 to $1,000 from the GST to set against that total of $2,525, plus the other things I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we arrive at the 70 per cent adversely affected? These families would be a large proportion of Australian families&mdash;and on the Government's say-so the package will adequately compensate the lowest income groups. How do we get this divergence?  The answer, which has been much featured in the debate today, is that the Treasury says that we must compensate not only for the CPI effect, but also for bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first comment in assessing this point I say that for Treasury to assert that the bracket creep that occurs between the June quarter 1993 and the March quarter 1996 would have to be returned, is attempting to set a standard that no government, and particularly this Labor Government, has ever adhered to. Indeed since 1983 the Labor Government has used more than $25 billion of revenue from bracket creep, which has not been handed back to the taxpayers despite adjustments to the tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even recognising that, how does one calculate this bracket creep? Basically one looks at the inflation element over the period in view and follows a certain procedure. In most instances of `indexing tax scales in order to isolate bracket creep', this takes place in the context of a situation where wages and inflation are increasing at pretty similar rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actually that is the case in scenario C upon which the Treasury drew for this exercise. If one takes the years 1994-95 and 1995-96, the CPI effect for the first year is 7.7 per cent and for the second year it is 5.9 per cent&mdash;around 6 or 7 per cent&mdash;while wage increases of 6.9 and 6.5 per cent in those two years, respectively, are also shown. However, as one can gather from this debate, there can always be a dispute about the appropriate factor to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury appears to have based revenue estimates on a low wage increase, the sort of wage increase&mdash;3.5 per cent&mdash;we had in mind when we talked about and formulated our tax cuts, and a tax indexation factor based on an inflation figure of 7 per cent. That is a very atypical situation. As I said, typically one deals with a situation where wage and price increases are of about the same magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if one does proceed to do a calculation on the basis of those two figures, and in particular if one works out the amount one believes ought to be returned, one is working out something which is compensation not just for bracket creep, but also for the fall in real wages implicit in such a situation. That is, if wages are going up by 3.5 per cent and inflation is going up by 7 per cent, real wages will be falling. If one thus calculates on the basis of what purports to be bracket creep, one would in fact be calculating a quantum that not only compensates for bracket creep, but also compensates for the fall in real wages. No government has any obligation to compensate for a fall in real wages. It perhaps has an obligation to do something about it and, in particular, to get inflation under control and the citizens out of that sort of situation. However, there is no obligation so to compensate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have not had the opportunity to go over all the figures of the Treasury in detail, one can see that the reconciliation between what happens to the $25,000 a year group in Fightback and what is contended in the Treasury document is that the so-called bracket creep adjustment contained in that table, which they say is a `Comparison of the Opposition's Tax Cut with the True Effect'&mdash;sic, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) would say&mdash;`of Tax Scale After Allowing for the CPI Effect of Package and Bracket Creep' is very much larger than it ought to be. It is, in effect, compensation on the face of it&mdash;because one plucks one figure from one spot and another figure from another spot&mdash;for a fall in real wages as well. That largely affects the calculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above that, I assert that the coalition has committed itself unequivocally to the return of bracket creep and that what we see in the Fightback package is a situation where tax cuts are funded and bracket creep returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then comes back to the starting point of the whole speech. That is, there is allegedly a fiscal hole of $4 billion in the Fightback estimates. I suggest the Government check what it has written in the speech of the Treasurer of Tuesday. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed expenditure cuts are massively overstated to the order of $2.7 billion and revenue is understated to the order of $1.1 billion, giving a total funding shortfall in the package of nearly $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>If it is understated, how can that contribute to it? They mean it is overstated. Let us accept that the Government claims that we have overstated the revenue. If one looks through the documents one comes to some pages in that massive pile, with a table that is often repeated and certainly shows an estimate of revenue, in the context it is talking about, of $1,699m as an estimate from the coalition and an estimate from the Treasury of $552m. There is a difference of about $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That difference of $1 billion is very largely an estimate that we included in relation to the black economy. The Treasury rejects that on the basis that GST is paid from the money that people in the black economy spend in the ordinary economy, that is, it is caught up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is another big component in the black economy. That is the input tax that people in the black economy pay, for example a plumber who is going to do a job for cash. The plumber has to buy the materials and so on to do the job. He pays the input tax but because he is working in the black economy, he cannot get it back. The aggregate of such input tax is a large amount when one considers that reasonable estimates of the Australian black economy are of the order of 10 per cent of gross domestic product, in the order of $30 to $40 billion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This censure motion is directed against the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on the basis of what is described as his gross distortion of the Fightback package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been bandied around in this House over the last few days is not just the argument that Treasury got it wrong. Personally, I would have no problem if the debate was being led by the Opposition on the basis that there are mistakes in Treasury's calculations, in its analysis of the Fightback package. But we are being told that the Treasurer produced a document&mdash;he did not prepare it; it was prepared by officers of Treasury&mdash;which was manipulated and the subject of gross distortion. If it is the subject of gross distortion, who produced the gross distortion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we saying that officers in Treasury who were acting under instructions from a former Treasurer, or any Treasury official, said, `What we're going to do is not an objective analysis of the costs and benefits or the disadvantages of the Fightback package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that in December the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), who is also the shadow Treasurer, was seeking to use the processes of freedom of information to discover what work was being done by Treasury. At that stage was there any argument in this House in respect of a package which had been produced by the Opposition, I might say with some enthusiasm on its part?  This is the first time for years that members of the Opposition have sat down and produced anything that even looked like a policy document. I can understand their ebullience and enthusiasm for that. It was a landmark that the Opposition produced any policy document at all. However, the fact that it produced a policy document does not mean that everything in it is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are being told by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the shadow Treasurer and their minions that this is the answer to all of Australia's economic woes. If one were to take the Opposition's most optimistic scenario&mdash;assuming there will be an election in the early to middle part of next year and, God help us, assuming that those opposite might be successful&mdash;this great package will have no impact on the Australian economy or on the current economic problems facing Australian citizens until late next year at the very earliest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plenty of questions could have been directed to the Treasurer today, as questions were directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday. Question Time is a very important time for an Opposition: the time to probe; the time to ask the questions which will prove distortion; the time to seek the facts which will prove some of the allegations being bandied around this House. But in the past two days we have had no attempt to perform that process, which is the responsibility of an Opposition, but an attempt to curtail with two specious motions the Opposition's own right to ask questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the terminology that was used by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. He talked about a `dirty-tricks campaign' using `cooked-up Treasury analysis'. For a responsible Leader of the Opposition to use a term such as `cooked-up Treasury analysis' is to make a serious allegation. He is not saying that the Budget analysis deserves criticism because it is wrong in parts. In my view, given the way in which the Fightback package was presented, there has been nothing like it since Moses handed down the Ten Commandments. This was the answer to all the problems!  The new prophet was the professor who was going to solve all the economic ills of Australia by producing this Fightback package!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at a totally new tax scheme, is it not responsible and appropriate&mdash;and it was deemed to be so by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for why else would he seek to use the freedom of information process&mdash;to find out what is happening?  The Treasurer came into the Parliament, produced the document, laid it on the table and said, `There it is'. One cannot do anything more than that. At that stage, a responsible Leader of the Opposition could have joined issue at a time of his choosing&mdash;after a proper and effective analysis of this document&mdash;to refute those areas which he felt were misrepresented or did not adequately analyse the Fightback package. In my view, there could have been no argument with that process. Instead, what did we have?  We had a censure motion alleging that there had been a conspiracy; that Treasury officers had produced a cooked-up analysis; and that, in the terms of the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . . . forsaking its independence, in a way that was to provide the basis for an orchestrated dirty tricks campaign this week about the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us examine the significance of those words. If one alleges that officers of the ABC have forsaken their independence for an orchestrated dirty tricks campaign, one is saying that officers in the ABC&mdash;presumably at a very senior level&mdash;have said, `We are going to develop a political agenda which means analysing what has to be regarded as a serious document produced by the Opposition in a way that will do it great damage'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, I watched the ABC program. If one is out to misrepresent and distort the arguments that can be put forward in terms of the Fightback package, why make time available to the shadow Treasurer&mdash;who carries the responsibility of selling this package&mdash;so that any point made on the program with which he disagrees can be immediately joined?  It would be open to him to say, `Look, you've got it wrong there' or, `That is an inaccurate misrepresentation'. But did the shadow Treasurer, who went on that program, come out and say, `From the outset, before I say anything, I want to charge certain officers in the ABC with dishonesty, with lack of integrity, with abusing their position and with deliberately and falsely misleading the people of Australia in dealing with this Fightback package'? No, he did not. It was not until the Leader of the Opposition found himself under pressure in this place and unable to deal with the very substantial allegations which showed that what he has been saying to the people of Australia is inaccurate and misleading and will not solve their economic problems that the shadow Treasurer said anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does he say? He does not say to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, `Let's set time aside and we will argue this out'. What we get are allegations of conspiracy and distortion. If you are going to make those allegations, it is incumbent upon you to prove them. We are not being asked to deal with a situation in which what has been suggested is that there has just been a mistake or a miscalculation, that Treasury has somehow got it wrong; we are being asked to accept that it is a cooked-up analysis&mdash;that is his terminology. That is a dishonest accusation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage in the last two days has there been any attempt to prove the accuracy of that statement. What we get is the minions of the Opposition coming into the House repeating those sorts of allegations. As an exercise in due parliamentary process, it is a process of contempt, a process without honour and a process which shows that this Leader of the Opposition is a man with a glass jaw. He must not be questioned. He must not be examined. Everything he says has to be accepted as if it were the truth of an Old Testament prophet. We have a born-again Opposition, a born-again coalition&mdash;the new apocryphals preaching the testament of the GST&mdash;and its prophet professor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this Government is going to subject this alternative package to the scrutiny it deserves. The package has already been found wanting. It has already been found not to do the things that it claims. It has already been shown to shift the burden from those who are in a privileged position in Australian society to low income groups. It has already been shown to be inaccurate in its forecasts and socially inequitable in its effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let those issues be joined, but not on the basis of saying, `There has been a conspiracy at the ABC. There has been a conspiracy in Treasury'. That will not wash. That is the argument of a Leader of the Opposition who, confronted with the realities that must come from examining this package, says, `You have to presume that everything I say is truthful and right, and any suggestion that it is not is evidence of conspiracy&mdash;evidence of dishonesty. If there is an analysis made by Treasury, that only proves that it is dishonest. If there is an analysis made by the ABC in the public interest, you can join interests and say that it got it wrong'. But he is not entitled to come into this House and abuse the processes of this Parliament by saying not that the ABC got it wrong but that it was part of a conspiracy, part of an exercise, which if it were true would mean that the senior executives of the ABC ought to be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a tittle of evidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Full marks to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) and all those responsible for producing the Fightback package. It is, as even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports acknowledged, by far the most comprehensive economic document produced by an Opposition in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We start off by having a document that is significant, extensive and comprehensive. When was it produced? Not last week, like the Prime Minister's sixteenth economic statement; it was produced way back last year&mdash;not at the end of last year, but three months before the end of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing now? In March, these few days after this sitting began, we are not talking about the sixteenth economic statement of the Prime Minister; we are still talking about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Why? Because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document provides a vision for Australia. It provides a comprehensive opportunity to get Australia out of the mess we are in&mdash;to get Australia out of this appalling economic malaise which the man who is now Prime Minister has generated for us. Let us have a bit of perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken nearly six months for the Government to even come to know what the devil to talk about. When it does talk about it, what does it do? It has a document that suddenly appears on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>. I want to talk about that and the ABC because it reflects something of the morality and attitude of the Government in its approach to national management. We were told, albeit on the ABC, by the man who was the previous Treasurer, that in fact he had the document on the eve of the change of status of the previous Prime Minister and that Treasurer losing his job. He was going to say a bit about it, but somehow it got lost in the murky dealings of leadership change in the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken from last December to this March for the Government to even produce the document. The Government had to do something with it. It said, `We are not sure how, but it was slipped up, and we managed to get the ABC and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program to have one month to have a look at it'. That it took one month does not say very much about the ABC. Leaving that aside, the Government has had one month to produce this Treasury analysis. I want to say both to this Parliament and to the people of Australia that you have to understand that it has taken all this time for the Government to mount an argument that would in any way dent a hole in this economic package that the coalition has presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analysis has raised more questions than it has resolved. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out today, the whole basis of the analysis produced by Treasury was flawed. It was not based on the same criteria as those used for an analysis of the Government's sixteenth economic statement. It was not even based on the same arithmetic as is inherent within the Fightback package. What it has done, as in so many of the other analyses that have been produced to date, is not really look at the total package presented by the Opposition; it has looked essentially at the goods and services tax&mdash;this option C that the Prime Minister at the National Taxation Summit decided was by far the best solution to Australia's economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to understand that the analysis produced by the Treasury was on a different basis. The analysis produced by the Treasury, but at the behest of the Treasurer&mdash;I am not too sure which one initially commissioned it&mdash;was produced so long ago that one really has to be a bit suspicious. Why has the Government taken so long to produce it, and where has it been?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, although it has been produced, it has fundamental flaws. Under coalition plans, there is $1.2 billion in revenue that is to be gained through bracket creep and, of course, that should have been returned to Government calculations on the effects of the Fightback package to give a true picture of its effects. What did the Government do? It admitted that $1.2 billion. First, we have the time; second, we have the fundamental flaw; and, third, the essential arithmetic of the package has also been fiddled with. We all know that the Government has used a high inflation figure but ignored the wages outcome prediction of 3.5 per cent per annum. So it has a package that has an inherent flaw in it because it has left this great gap in it; it contains an arithmetical error; and it has taken months to produce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But what I am concerned about is that the Government ought to start addressing the fundamental problems of getting jobs for Australians. It ought to worry about the malaise that is in small business and in family farms in all of our electorates. If Labor Party members, including the Prime Minister, were to go back to their electorates occasionally, they would know it is in their electorates too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing more distressing than talking to somebody who has just lost his job. I come from the bush and I have a few station hands in my part of the world. They have worked well; they have worked hard. They have made a contribution to Australia. They have never been unemployed before in their lives. Many of them have not had the education that many people in this House have had, but they have been darned good workers. They have made a contribution. I saw a few of them a week or so ago in my electorate, in a little town called Bundarra. They said to me, `What are we going to do?  We have been told we can stay on in the houses and the properties where we have worked for 20-odd years, but where do we go for a job? What are we going to do about looking after our kids? How are they going to get the same opportunity for tomorrow as we were told we were going to have? What is in this sixteenth economic package of the Prime Minister that is going to give them a job?'. I thought that perhaps there might be something there and I wondered how I was going to analyse that in the few minutes available to me. </PARA>

There will be no critical analysis, none of this business of looking dispassionately and saying, `Look, have you thought about the other side of the argument?'.

<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have pointed out those errors&mdash;a $1.2 billion shortfall as far as bracket creep is concerned, a fiddle with the inflation figure and a fiddle with the wages outcome. In addition, the Government has not been prepared to compare its own sixteenth economic statement with our Fightback package on the same criteria. What does it say&mdash;`misleading and incompetently costed'? How incredible this is!  In any event, what we should be doing is looking at what the Government is doing. It is in government.

This morning I saw an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which read `Debt blow-out mars better BoP figures'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>If the Government is going to get jobs, they are going to cost it about $40,000 in debt. Already the debt is blossoming. The Government has created the overseas debt, and how is it going to fund it? It is going to fund it by more debt. The Government's figure of 800,000 jobs is farcical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point in the amendment censures the Opposition for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its deliberate persecution of those who are social security and unemployment beneficiaries;</PARA>
<PARA>It has left out everybody at the bottom of its tax changes. The next point is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its failure to address the infrastructure requirements of micro economic reform programs;</PARA>
<PARA>My friend opposite ought to know that in 1983-84 the present Prime Minister, when Treasurer, eliminated our capital program for rail networks around Australia. The Government has been taking from the railways through diesel excise hundreds of millions per year since 1983-84 and not putting anything back. It is absolutely farcical for it suddenly to say, `Oh, how generous we are being'. If it had provided that money since 1983-84, there would be a redevelopment of the networks and we would not have any of our present problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Government talks about reviewing business taxation. Well, I can tell it that small business is going broke; bankruptcies are at a record level and receivership is at a record level. The Government has failed. I regard the Government amendment as a farce, I regard the Treasurer as a failure, and I think the sixteenth economic package of the present Prime Minister is an absolute disgrace in a climate of despair and desperation amongst the ordinary people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct some of my remarks to those things which were said by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). In politics, the essential conflict that is faced by all of us is between being popular and doing what is right. It is a conflict which exists in all spheres of endeavour. In business, the conflict is really between making a profit and, again, being popular or pricing oneself appropriately. An example in recent times for all of us to ruminate on is that of Compass Airlines. It was very popular but very unprofitable, and the outcome eventually, of course, was its demise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussion on this censure motion today we have had some of the most absurd propositions put by members of the Opposition, none, of course, more outstanding than that just made by the right honourable member for New England in his contribution and that by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) earlier when they complained that, in analysing the Fightback package and the Government's approach, the One Nation strategy, the same assumptions should have been made in both packages. They asserted that in order to have a fair comparison between these two packages we would have to make the same assumptions about inflation, growth, wages and a number of parameters that are fed into the computer. That is an absurd proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not putting forward a proposition that includes a consumption tax. There is no value added tax in any of our proposals. So one's assumptions on interest rates, inflation, wages and all of those things have to be different in the Opposition's package when compared with our package. That is the first point which needs to be made very clearly. It is simply facile, dishonest and misleading for members of the Opposition to suggest that the same criteria should be applied in both of those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that was made by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the right honourable member for New England was that members of the Opposition should be rewarded because they have come up with an alternative; they actually produced something different. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made the point yesterday&mdash;and I believe it is true&mdash;that the guiding ethos behind what they had to say was that it should be different. It certainly is different. It is a different strategy; it is a different approach. As such it deserves consideration by the Government, and the Government has given it consideration and has taken it upon itself and upon the institutions of this country, the Treasury and the Department of Finance, to make an assessment of the efficacy of this package and the effects of the Opposition's approach. It is absolutely clear from that study that the Opposition has got the numbers wrong. Not only is it the case that 70 per cent of Australians will be worse off, but the fundamental institutions of this country that are the basic structures that people look for in a caring and compassionate society would be pulled down by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The universal health care system which provides for all Australians in times of need, sickness, accident, chronic illness, or whatever the circumstances may be, is to be pulled down by the Opposition. A renaissance has occurred in this country in education. The importance of education has massively increased in the minds of young people. We have had huge improvements in retention rates. Eight years ago only 35 per cent of young people were going on to finish year 12; we have now doubled that figure. It is becoming increasingly the case that Australians, including young Australians, are understanding the importance of education for their future and are being given the opportunity. We have provided 120,000 new places in universities since 1987&mdash;that is the equivalent of 12 new universities&mdash;and still the demand increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that governments provide access to facilities and access to education. But what is the solution offered by the Opposition?  It says, `We are going to charge high fees, and if we charge high fees at university you have to pay for your education. If you want to do medicine the fee is $20,000 a year, and if you want to do law the fee is $10,000 a year'. You will limit the number of young people willing to enter those courses. You are going to ration them by price. You can do that, and that is what you are proposing. Unfortunately, even in these times where supposedly there are large numbers of people wanting to go to university, we find the Bond University, which offers those sorts of facilities, clamouring to fill its spots because people are not rushing to pay $12,000 a year. They simply cannot afford it because it is outside their means. You are saying to everyone, `We are gong to put this caveat on your education and your possibilities of education'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are offering in One Nation is a significant shift towards tertiary, technical and further education. We are offering a shift which will provide increased resources for the States to provide for technical education, a critical area of education that has been neglected in this country. Even before One Nation was produced it was significant that the undertakings of the Government in November last year were greater than those of the Opposition in Fightback. With the improvement, and the increased funding that we have promised for technical education, those figures will even be surpassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have is a policy prescription put forward by the Opposition which tears down many of those things which are critical to providing for a compassionate and caring society. It tears those away and, at the same time, it distributes large amounts of money from the poorer sections of our society to the pockets of those who are wealthy. Those people in this country who earn more than $90,000 a year and are motivated purely by self-interest would be insane if they voted for the ALP at the next election, because if this package gets up their circumstances will be massively improved. Essentially that is what it is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said when I started my speech, the essential conflict that one faces in politics is that between being popular and doing what is right. We have the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) parading around the country saying that he is above politics; he does not indulge in petty sniping and all of the things that we in this place see him doing every day. He says he is above politics and he is really concerned about doing the right thing. But when we look at his proposals we find a whole lot of sugar coated pills in there, things that are going to be popular but, unfortunately, are based on false premises. The whole ethos behind the package is that Australia is a high taxing country, and because it is a high taxing country we need to lower personal income tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at comparisons within the OECD&mdash;those Western nations who have similar economies to ours&mdash;we find that, of 24 OECD countries, Australia is the second lowest taxing country. So the basic premise that we need to cut personal income tax rates to increase incentive and do all these things that can be done because of that is false. Australia is a low taxing country and we have tax rates which compare very favourably. Members of the Opposition make the point that they are trying to shift the tax base from personal income tax to consumption. Again, if one compares us with other OECD countries, one finds that Australia is in the bottom third for personal income tax. So there is no basis for that fundamental premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second viewpoint that is put forward is that the Public Service is too big and therefore we need to cut expenditure in that area. Again we find that, compared with other OECD countries, Australia has a small Public Service. We do not find massive bureaucracies in this country operating in the same way that they operate in many of those other places with which we would like to compare ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition would say that the health care system does not work, it is a disgrace, there are queues in hospitals and we need to do something about it. But the prescription that they put forward is an ugly one, and one which can only lead us to the conclusion that what they want to see in Australia is the sort of health care system that exists in the United States. In the United States at present there are 35 million people who have no health insurance. The most prevalent cause of bankruptcy in the United States is ill health. Even if a person is lucky enough to have health insurance&mdash;which is limited, and limited in the time span for which it lasts&mdash;if he loses his health, if he suffers a chronic illness, then not only is it a sentence to his health and perhaps his livelihood, but also it certainly means financial ruin. That is not the sort of system that we need in this country. We have a caring system. We have a system that shares the load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this place before that there are things that we could do to improve the system. I do not deny that. But I say to honourable members that the proposal that the AMA and the health funds should decide what they charge is absurd. The proposal that $31 up front will be the requirement every time we go to see the doctor is absurd. The proposal that those two institutions would act in the best interests of the nation in respect of how health care is managed is absurd. Therefore, it is not a sensible proposition, and it makes no sense at all to pursue that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already outlined some of the changes which the Opposition wants to introduce in respect of the education system. Central to the Opposition's package is the consumption tax&mdash;the value added tax, as it would be called in the United Kingdom. When one looks at that proposal one finds it frightening in the extreme. Many other countries over the decades have introduced consumption taxes. However, almost invariably those taxes have been introduced with a split rate. Some items are taxed more than others. But, for some philosophical reason, because of some ideological zealotry&mdash;whatever the reason&mdash;the Opposition has decided that there is some merit in there being only one rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings into sharp focus the Opposition's lack of compassion and lack of concern for those people who are most needy in our society. Why should it not be the case that a Mercedes-Benz motor car which sells for $80,000 attracts a higher rate than a family car, such as a Toyota Corolla, which sells for $20,000?  Why should different tax rates not be levied on those things, as occurs in other countries?  Why should it not be the case that food, clothing and housing essentials are taxed at a different rate from those things which we consider to be luxury items?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, most countries of the world which have such a tax have chosen to take that route, because they know how harsh, how difficult and how hard a single rate tax can be. Under the Opposition's tax proposal&mdash;and honourable members opposite are willing to say that it affects all these items at a substantial rate&mdash;dairy products, cereals, fresh fruit and vegetables and the like will be taxed at around 10 per cent extra. There will be a 10 per cent price increase for all of those items. Are those opposite suggesting that well-meaning shopkeepers will immediately drop the price of such goods according to the tax changes that will occur for those items? Are they suggesting that some adjustments will be made?  I do not think that is the case. All of the empirical evidence suggests that those things will continue to be charged at the same price, plus 10 per cent. Clothing, electricity, post and telephone charges and health services, all of which are presently excluded, will be taxed at a significant rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found in the last two days, because of a substantial and thorough distributional analysis by the Treasury and a substantial and thorough assessment of the Opposition's package, that there are huge holes in the package. Billions of dollars are missing from the Opposition's proposals. It is the case that the Australian population needs to know that. The Australian population needs to know that the Opposition is proposing that 70 per cent of people will be worse off. It needs to know that all of their fresh fruit and vegetables, cereal, bread and meat will be taxed by the Opposition at the rate of 15 per cent if it ever wins government. It needs to know that electricity, postage, health care and education will all be more expensive and that the Australian people will be responsible for bearing the cost. There will be no community rating, no sharing of the load, no contract between the Government and the population in general, as exists now. That will be out of the door and ideology will rule. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, improving service delivery is a major priority of the Department of Social Security. The Government has decided on a further key initiative in pursuit of this priority. The measures I am announcing today will radically alter the way the DSS does business, bringing immediate and long term benefits for both clients and staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has an arduous and complex task in administering social security programs which make payments to five million people around Australia. It now has over 20,000 staff in 300 locations. In this financial year DSS will make payments totalling $27 billion, representing 27 per cent of all Commonwealth outlays. The Department's running costs will amount to only a little over 3 per cent of its outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Social Security Act, the Secretary to the Department, in administering the Act, is required to seek to deliver its many services in a fair, courteous, prompt and cost-efficient manner. Despite the best efforts of very dedicated and committed staff, this task has become increasingly difficult, as the stresses of recession in the community are reflected in stresses within the office network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has coped well with the pressures of increasing numbers of people using DSS offices. Although the economy is moving out of recession, overall DSS client numbers are expected to continue to rise, at least in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, Government measures to increase targeting of payments; to safeguard the integrity of the social security system; to adopt a more active approach to helping the unemployed, the disabled and sole parents to return to work; and to help the aged to increase their incomes have led to more people contacting the Department and visiting its regional offices. In some cases the offices are not big enough to handle the volume of clients, causing long queues and overcrowding and leading to irritation, frustration and sometimes aggression among clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has acted to avoid situations which have occurred overseas when such pressures on, and tensions in, social security offices have led to physical violence. The Government has provided money for new and improved DSS offices. Over the last 12 months, 20 new offices have been opened, eight relocated to new premises and five refurbished to provide better public contact areas. This program is continuing, with another five new regional offices and 28 smaller outlets planned, 18 more scheduled for relocation and another 20 to be remodelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's Budget, the Government announced funding for replacement of the Department's computer network over the next five years. There are more staff to meet demands, training has been boosted, new devolved organisational structures have been put in place and classifications in area and regional offices improved. One whole layer of management, State offices, has been eliminated to improve management and communication. The Social Security Act itself has been completely rewritten in plain English and updated and manuals and information material have been improved to make them easier to use and more accessible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these measures, the Government accepts that more needs to be done. To reduce the pressures on regional offices and to improve client service, the Government has decided to introduce teleservice centres. This idea of initial client contact by telephone has been used successfully by the US social security administration as well as by some large firms. </PARA>
<PARA>Teleservice centres will revolutionise the way that DSS does business. They will reduce the need for clients to travel to DSS offices and enable staff to provide more time and assistance when personal visits are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National surveys of clients, welfare groups and staff have shown that a good deal of business with DSS can be concluded successfully by telephone. Teleservice centres will mean that staff in offices will be more productive. Staff can give visitors more detailed attention, reducing the likelihood of return visits to finish business. Greater staff efficiency, in turn, helps to guarantee that correct decisions are taken and correct payments are made and reduces the number of inquiries. A further bonus is that public contact areas are less crowded and that both clients and staff experience less stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent teleservice centre trial in Brisbane has confirmed the benefits of this approach. Telephone calls to selected regional offices were redirected automatically to a pilot teleservice centre staffed by experienced DSS officers. More than 90 per cent of all telephone calls from the public were able to be satisfied on the spot by teleservice centre operators. The regional offices taking part in the trial report that the number of clients in offices have reduced, timeliness of payments has improved, backlogs of work reduced significantly and fewer extra staff had to be recruited to meet seasonal peaks. Overall, there has been quicker service and more client satisfaction. The impact of publicising the teleservice with one national number should amplify the benefits demonstrated in the Brisbane trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to establish a network of 11 DSS teleservice centres using a single, easily remembered, well-publicised telephone number nationwide. In keeping with the requirement in the Social Security Act, this service will be available anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local phone call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect the first of these centres to be operating by May 1992. They will be located across Australia with one each in Perth and Adelaide, two in Melbourne, another in Geelong, two in Sydney, one each in Wollongong and Newcastle and two in Queensland. The teleservice centres will each have from 80 to 150 staff. Teleservice means that people can contact DSS by phone in the first instance to request information or forms, to advise a change in circumstances or to question payments or decisions. The DSS teleservice operators will be able to answer most inquiries on the spot. They will also be able to arrange, if necessary, an appointment for the client to attend the nearest regional office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major advantage will be that teleservice operators will be able to take action on changes of circumstances advised by phone with direct input into the computer system which sends a confirmatory advice letter to the client. This new network will reduce the need for clients to visit DSS offices for information and many services. To complete the network, the multilingual telephone information service will be linked to the teleservice centres, making it one of the most comprehensive service- and information-giving operations in the world. The new arrangements will absorb existing hot lines and 008 numbers. They will enable extension of hours of service Australia-wide, using teleservice operators in the different time zones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that all telephone contact with the Department through teleservice centres will be based on strict rules for the positive identification of callers and for client confidentiality and privacy. For those clients who still need or wish to call at DSS offices, a computerised appointments system linked to the teleservice centres will make that easier and more efficient. Firm appointments can be arranged by teleservice staff or through other agencies, such as the Commonwealth Employment Service. These more efficient and convenient arrangements will add to the privacy of a client's visit and clients will not have to queue or wait very long to get attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, clients faced with emergencies will always be seen quickly by trained client service officers or by social workers. People will still be able to visit regional offices without contacting DSS first by telephone but they will have to wait their turn. Personal lodgment of forms relating to Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The set-up costs for the teleservice centre network will be $15m: in round terms, $10m for property and $5m for salary and related administrative costs. In the longer term, the cost will be offset by productivity savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to teleservice centres, other improvements to DSS services are being introduced. First, my Department will increase its out-of-office services. Home visits will be made to frail elderly and disabled clients who have difficulty getting to DSS offices. Portable computers will enable DSS officers to give these clients the same level of service they would expect in a DSS outlet without risking privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, new units will be established in DSS areas to receive claims and assist people in institutions so that it will usually not be necessary for them to go to DSS offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the Department will upgrade services to homeless youth and other disadvantaged people by extending the successful pilot service arrangements under which DSS officers work in places such as youth refuges. This is in line with the Government's youth social justice strategy and reinforces our commitment to ensuring that young homeless people have access to assistance to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, following successful trials, the Department will have experienced officers to help and guide people in the public contact areas of most of its offices. These client liaison officers will assist waiting clients, regulate queues and be able to deal with people with minor queries or direct them to action officers. It has been demonstrated that client liaison officers are able to temper client frustration and even prevent aggressive behaviour by speeding up service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, while the Department will continue to base its major services around regional offices, it is opening smaller outlets to improve access for clients, particularly in country areas. I propose to examine the DSS network closely over the coming months in the light of the effect of teleservice centres and other initiatives and will consider the need for a longer term program to improve the office network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixth, in a major step forward, the Department will publish its performance standards, which will cover both quantitative and qualitative aspects of service delivery. The standards will be tabled during the Budget sittings. Performance against the standards will then be published annually in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teleservice centres combined with action already taken and the other initiatives I have mentioned will reduce the need for many people to visit Social Security offices. Public areas will be less crowded and more private. As office layout improves, staff should be able to interview clients at their normal workplace with design features that will add to client privacy and staff security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no issue more central to improving client services than confidentiality of information. The Government and the Department have already done a great deal to ensure that clients' privacy is guarded and the confidentiality of their personal information maintained. In fact, the Privacy Commissioner himself recently stated that the Department of Social Security had `worked hard at the privacy issue during the time I've dealt with it, in fact I think it's probably the Department that's worked hardest at the issue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is not what the Department does to protect privacy that attracts public attention, but the occasional failures in its systems which cause a breach of privacy. That is not to say that breaches of client confidentiality are acceptable. They are totally unacceptable. The Department is acutely aware that, each time a client's confidential personal details are inadvertently released, the integrity of the whole DSS system is undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Department is working extremely hard, with the Privacy Commissioner, to ensure that there will be no repeat of the incident which recently led to some clients being sent the personal details of other clients as well as their own. I can assure honourable members that everything possible is being done to prevent any recurrence. In the meantime, the new state-of-the-art service delivery initiatives I am announcing today will further protect client privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I want to pay tribute to the staff of my Department, who rarely receive the praise they deserve. They deliver a service to a standard second to none. To all of them, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend the thanks of all honourable members for carrying out their work with continuing commitment and compassion in increasingly difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a social security system which is envied the world over for its scope, for its equity and for its integrity. I am confident that the measures I am announcing today will ensure that its standard of service delivery is also unparalleled. In short, these changes will ensure that dignity is an integral part of service delivery. More details of these and other initiatives designed to improve the quality of services to clients are included in a supplementary document which I now table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I notice that the ministerial statement entitled `Improving Client Service Delivery in the Department of Social Security' has already been listed for debate in the Senate. In fact, I think it has already been debated. I want to thank the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) for that because he realises the dual responsibility in this regard. I listened to some of the debate in the other House. The following comment is made within the Minister's statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the economy is moving out of recession, overall DSS client numbers are expected to continue to rise, at least in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is evidence of why the Department's client relationships and service delivery have to be improved. It is a result of the Government's own recession, which is admitted within this document, that there has been a huge increase in the number of clientele of the Department. We can talk about the increasing number of unemployed throughout Australia at the moment&mdash;over one million people, and that is a conservative figure. We can talk about the homeless, as the Minister has done in his statement. The figure for homelessness was to be reduced so that no child was living in poverty by the year 1990. This is evidence of the state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister says, `Although the economy is moving out of recession', I often wonder in which way we are moving out of the recession and whether we are moving to a depression. As I say, there is no surer sign of that than the increasing number of unemployed, the homeless, the number of businesses that are going bankrupt or being liquidated and the number of people who are moving out of business, and I believe the Minister has indicated this within his statement. We must realise that the Department of Social Security is the shopfront of the Government to account to the public for the recession we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, far from having a monopoly on social justice, the Government and the Minister for Social Security have absolutely no conception of it. The Minister's statement is not about helping the victims of government recession, but about making these things easier for government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the announcement of the massive reduction in client contact with the advent of the new so-called teleservice centres&mdash;although undoubtedly it will increase efficiency for the Department of Social Security&mdash;is really a $15m bureaucratic solution to a Government-created problem. Teleservice centres are about removing government from the people and from the problem itself. The Minister's announcement is yet another example of the Government running away from the recession&mdash;its own recession, which has created one million unemployed, as I said before; which has created homelessness; and which has led to early retirements. In fact, it is often admitted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that it is his own induced recession&mdash;the one we had to have. If the Minister and his Labor colleagues were in any way interested in social justice, they would begin implementing the policy prescriptions that the coalition has advocated for quite a long time in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claims to be concerned about privacy. This is hard to believe from a man who announced on his own home turf&mdash;the South Australian ALP State Conference&mdash;just several years ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say as a Socialist that it is the interests of the community that should come before the individual right. . . We shouldn't get too hung up as Socialists on privacy, because privacy in many ways is a bourgeois right that is very much associated with the right to private property.</PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought, with such attitudes, a person would forfeit the right to be the Minister for Social Security in charge of the private details of over five million Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister followed through with this disregard for privacy when, after the latest social security debacle in which the Department sent financial and other details of 6,000 of its clients to 6,000 other clients, he announced on ABC television that he considered that paying compensation to the victims of this privacy breach was inappropriate. This demonstrated a complete disregard for the Privacy Act, which says quite clearly that such determinations for compensation are entirely the prerogative of the Privacy Commission and that the only recourse the Department of Social Security or the Minister would have to change such a determination is an appeal to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister had any concern for privacy and social justice, he would simply contract out the Social Security's central computing and other facilities. The Government has already shown that it can be done with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is a precedent, but as usual it is the Minister's ideological hang-up that will get in the way of good, sound policy in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if the social security privacy breach which occurred several weeks ago were to recur with a private contractor, the firm would immediately lose the contract, producing a very real incentive for firms holding such contracts to be extra vigilant against committing such privacy breaches. This incentive would be installed where currently there is no incentive at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document has many initiatives which will bring the responsibility of social welfare back into the community and away from the faceless, anonymous bureaucrats. The sorts of initiatives which will pay real social justice dividends to the community, and not just for the likes of the Minister and his band of bureaucrats, include our local employment board proposal whereby local businessmen and other civic leaders will work hand in hand with the Department of Social Security to develop local training programs for those without jobs, thereby taking advantage of the regional knowledge and expertise of community leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second such initiative is our proposal to merge the CES with Social Security regional offices, a proposal which, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said in the material tabled in this place yesterday, will not only generate obvious savings from the sharing of administrative overheads, processing clients only once and no longer requiring joint interviews, but also mean that the unemployed have a one-stop shop to assist them in all their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the coalition's provision for an additional $35m for places in training programs earmarked for the disabled will encourage many Australians with impairments to seek training and employment, allowing them to become more actively involved in the community. Fourthly, the coalition makes provision of $57m for a disability allowance for those with serious impairments to help them with the additional costs of everyday life&mdash;costs which are additional as a consequence of their disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the coalition intends to contract out many functions within the Department of Social Security currently performed by bureaucrats but which would be better performed by community welfare workers. What use, for example, is a 9 to 5 social worker in the employ of Social Security to a person who has just pumped his veins full of heroin? Surely, if the Minister was serious about `improving client service delivery', he would turn over a large part of the $14m currently spent on social workers in his Department&mdash;social workers who, I might add, spend more time in administration and seeing the Department's own staff than the departmental clients&mdash;to the non-government welfare sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the coalition's proposal to provide an additional $50m in funding to the non-government welfare sector will also lead to a great advance in social justice and improved services to clients compared with the paltry and derisory $2m and then $3m Mr Recession himself handed out to the non-government sector in his so-called One Nation statement&mdash;or, as it is called at times, the `One Nation, One Job' statement, and the job being perseverance in office of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the coalition's social justice program is all about is providing a hand-up rather than simply another handout. What Labor is offering is simply another bureaucratic-led recovery. In addition to the many items in Fightback designed to enhance client service delivery in Australia, Senator Alston as Minister will also be implementing the following improvements to make the Department of Social Security a more professional, responsible and flexible component of the network&mdash;both private and public&mdash;which will deliver social justice under a Hewson government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional social security offices will be required to present a much more efficient, courteous and professional face. Clients will be treated with respect rather than indifference. Older, more experienced staff will be placed on those counters dealing with age pensioners. Such staff will be more sympathetic and understanding to the special group of clients they deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional offices are presently closed Wednesday afternoons across Australia, and many close early each day. On coming to government, we will reopen the offices on Wednesday afternoons and ensure they remain open at all other times within normal business hours. As mentioned before, many of the functions currently performed by bureaucrats but which can be more ably and efficiently performed by private contractors will be contracted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the list of items in the welfare sector that could be easily contracted out with better outcomes for all concerned, which have already been indicated by the coalition, it seems with the advent of the Minister's statement today that teleservice centres should be added to that list. If a contractor who performed this service breached the contractual obligations&mdash;that is, to provide the service with courtesy, fairness and efficiency, and to this should be added `privacy'&mdash;we would simply cancel the contract and give it to someone who could. Unfortunately for Australia, and especially for the clients who are the professed aim of today's `Improving Client Service Delivery' ministerial statement, this luxury is one which is not available to the ideologically and PSU hamstrung Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms I have outlined, the reforms the coalition will be making in government, are the types of reforms guaranteed to promote better client service delivery&mdash;the type of reforms this Government cannot deliver. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is recognised as a world leader in ozone protection. Australia's action in implementing the Protocol has been coordinated by the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, through the strategy for ozone protection, which was released in 1989. The strategy already provides a basis for phasing out the production and import of CFCs completely by the end of 1997 and is now being reviewed by ANZECC in the light of Australia's achievements to date and recent scientific assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, in 1989, there was resistance by some industry sectors to the early phase-out targets. With encouragement from ANZECC&mdash;that is, the environment Ministers&mdash;Australia, which was a very high per capita user of CFCs, has already reduced CFC consumption to less than 50 per cent of 1986 quantities. Under our present strategies, by the end of 1995 CFC consumption is likely to have been reduced to about 10 per cent of 1986 quantities, which would be mainly for certain essential uses and the servicing of existing equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some industries, such as the aerosol industry, have taken a very responsible attitude and have already almost completely eliminated the use of CFCs. Others have workable strategies in place or are in the process of developing their plans. Unfortunately one or two sectors remain relatively unmoved. It is imperative that all users of ozone depleting substances complete their planning for a changeover to transitional substances or ozone benign technologies. One thing is certain, the phase-out of ozone depleting substances will proceed. It is inevitable that those who do not plan ahead will face higher costs as the phase-out dates become closer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's decision to phase out CFCs in advance of the 1990 protocol requirements has been vindicated by the recent scientific assessments. International pressure is now mounting for the next review of the protocol to bring forward the phase-out dates. Such a development would bring international ozone protection policies closer to the target dates already established in our national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the Bill before the House will enable Australia to meet its international obligations. The Bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">controls on chemicals recently identified by the parties to the Montreal Protocol as being ozone depleting, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a means by which the Government is able to implement policies which will maintain Australia's prominent position in ozone protection. </PARA>
<PARA>Eleven substances&mdash;methyl chloroform and ten lesser known CFCs&mdash;will be incorporated into the licence and quota provisions of the Ozone Protection Act. Licences will only be granted to companies which manufactured, imported or exported the substances during the year 1989. Quotas will be granted to the same companies according to their market share in 1989. This will ensure that there are no new entrants into a diminishing market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quantity of carbon tetrachloride used in Australia, other than as a feedstock for the manufacture of other chemicals, is so small that a restricted licence system alone is sufficient to meet the policy objectives of controlling supply and providing for essential uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes a provision which enables quotas to be reduced in line with Government policy. In the past the Government has had some difficulty in implementing aspects of the national strategy because the Ozone Protection Act was tied to</PARA>
<PARA>the protocol. The new provision will allow for achievement of the strategy targets, set in close consultation with industry and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will therefore have more flexibility in a rapidly changing situation. For instance, the supply of ozone depleting substances can be reduced as implementation of the national strategy reduces demand. However, I should point out that the Government's commitment to replacing ozone depleting substances is contingent on the reasonable availability of suitable alternative substances and appropriate technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has been and will continue to be consulted on the development of Government policies in this area. Although the Government's primary consideration will be to maintain Australia's commitment to ozone protection, we will also seek to minimise impacts on industry by promoting the development of orderly plans for phasing out ozone depleting substances. Decisions made under this provision will be reviewable by application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the next few years there may be very rapid changes in ozone protection activity throughout the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also aware that there are practical reasons for Australia's strategies to be linked to those of the international community.

The direct impact on the healing of the ozone layer of Australia's phase-out policies is marginal.

However, Australia can make a contribution to ozone protection far in excess of the impact of our reductions of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the world's interest for developed countries such as Australia to lead by example, and in doing so encourage global compliance with international phase-out strategies. This is particularly significant when considering the escalating needs of developing countries for equipment which, at present, is often CFC-based. Australia has an important role to play in demonstrating what can be achieved and in pioneering strategies and programs which will be directly relevant to the enormous task that must be faced by developing countries if they are to meet protocol phase-out targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has no continuing financial implications, as licence fees automatically apply to substances placed on schedule 1 of the Act and are levied on each kilogram manufactured or imported.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 implements the Government's decision announced in its `One Nation-One Job' economic statement to reduce the rate of sales tax on some passenger motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The rate of reduction will apply only to some vehicles with a wholesale sales value of $35,505 or less and to all taxable dealings on or after 27 February 1992. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) noted in his second reading speech that sales of passenger motor vehicles have suffered heavily in the current recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This downturn in the car industry is perhaps most vividly illustrated by the recent decision of the Nissan car company to close its Australian production facility in Melbourne, with the eventual loss of some 1,800 jobs. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Question Time today waxed lyrical about the fact that he had been in Melbourne to witness the commencement of a new project at the Toyota premises. I would have thought that with the Nissan factory in the vicinity the Prime Minister might have fronted up and shown some compassion and comradeship towards those employees of Nissan, and try&mdash;if he could not actually do it in fact, and I do not think he can&mdash;to explain why their loss is being brought about and is the direct result of his deliberately engineered recession. However, the Prime Minister is not up to that sort of courage. Industry sales are said to be down by about 20 per cent in volume across all the main categories of motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we do not as yet have the benefit of the Automotive Industry Authority's report on the state of the automotive industry for 1991 to use as a reference in debate on this Bill. Nevertheless, as sure as night follows day, the report will, undoubtedly, show a major decline in the industry due to the Government's engineered recession. It is a great pity that it takes a recession, a depressed industry and the closure of a major manufacturing operation in this country for this Government to recognise the need for some relief from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this Bill will be to reduce the retail price of an average sedan by around 3 per cent, or approximately $800, notwithstanding the additional compliance costs the new sales tax rate will impose on the industry. The falls in price will range from about $620 on a 1.6 litre Toyota Corolla to about $830 for a 3.8 litre Holden Commodore Executive. Any such price reductions should give the car industry in Australia a much needed sales boost for both domestic and imported vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax rate of 30 per cent on so-called luxury vehicles will remain, however, so this segment of the market can be expected to continue its long term decline, which began with the Government's disastrous 50 per cent luxury car tax in 1990, and which is now being continued by the Government's policy induced recession. It should be remembered that what constitutes a luxury vehicle under this country's sales tax laws is any vehicle that meets the deemed wholesale sales tax value threshold of $31,564 for passenger vehicles or $45,462 retail value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be misled by unfortunate terminology into thinking that the luxury tax is imposed on vehicles with any inherently luxurious qualities other than price. Because of our high import duties, many cars that are considered standard or mid-range models in Asia and Europe acquire luxury car tax status when imported into Australia and hence incur the Australian tax now at a rate of 30 per cent. This, of course, is just one of the ways in which the Government seeks to protect the local car industry from international competition at the expense of Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Button car plan ends this year, imported passenger vehicles will still be subject to a tariff of 35 per cent, which is about three times the average tariff for the manufacturing sector as a whole. The overall effective rate of assistance for the car industry is around 86 per cent, which is about six times the manufacturing sector average. This high rate of assistance serves to price these cars out of the range of most Australians, despite their being considered mid-range models in other countries. Thus, so-called luxury cars in this country are very much luxuries of our own making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is obviously trying to be clever in adopting a 15 per cent rate of sales tax for some passenger motor vehicles. It thinks that, with the new rate, it can counter the appeal of the coalition's proposed goods and services tax and the beneficial price implications that the coalition's tax reform proposals will have for car prices and the car industry. In fact, the change in the sales tax rate contained in this Bill comes nowhere near matching the coalition's tax reform proposals in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, as I have already mentioned, the Government's proposed reduction in sales tax does not include so-called luxury vehicles which will continue to be taxed at the luxurious rate of 30 per cent. Nor does the proposed reduction in sales tax include off-road vehicles, such as four-wheel drives. Trucks, delivery vans, motor cycles, ambulances and a range of other vehicles will also continue to be taxed at a higher rate. Hence, farmers, small business people and a range of other business users of motor vehicles will get little or probably no sales tax relief under the proposed rate change for passenger motor vehicles. Like the Government's proposed personal income tax cuts, this rate will benefit corporate executives and others on generous salary packages at the expense of those who are really struggling under this Government's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition, all motor vehicles will be taxed at the uniform goods and services tax rate of 15 per cent which, of course, would be fully rebateable to business users of those vehicles, such that they would pay no sales tax on them at all. Moreover, we will abolish the full range of existing wholesale sales taxes, fuel excise and payroll taxes that currently add significantly to the price of motor vehicles and make such motor vehicles more expensive to own and operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition, for example, fuel would be 19c per litre cheaper for consumers and 26c per litre cheaper for business users, with obvious beneficial implications for the car industry, as well as job-creating businesses as a whole. If the Government was serious about giving the car industry a boost, it would have adopted the whole range of the coalition's tax reform proposals and it would have completely abolished the wholesale sales tax system. This would give much needed relief to Australian businesses across the board as well as to the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have instead is the Government's usual half-measures by which it has sought to give the semblance of the coalition's tax reform proposals, but without any of the actual substance. Moreover, the Bill will impose a greater compliance burden on the car industry and car buyers which will offset to some extent the gains from the proposed rate reduction. If the Government thinks it is doing the car industry a huge favour through this half-measure, it should think again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will greatly add to the complexity forced on the car industry and car buyers through the wholesale sales tax system. Once this Bill is enacted, Australian businesses will face no less than five different rates of sales tax; those rates being zero, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. The paperwork faced by car dealers and other businesses in complying with the existing four rates of wholesale sales tax is tough enough, without adding the complexity of yet another rate for a particular class of vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only two ways in which car dealers and other businesses can recoup these higher compliance costs: they will either pass the cost on to consumers by not reducing the retail price to fully reflect the fall in the wholesale price of the vehicles; or they will simply wear the increased compliance costs themselves. Either way, the industry and consumers lose out because of this Government's continued tinkering with the wholesale sales tax system at the expense of genuine and comprehensive tax reform, as spelt out by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be pointed out that the Bill, as currently drafted, has the effect of changing the formula used for calculating the luxury car tax threshold. Under this formula, the luxury car tax threshold is reduced to $43,937 from its current level of $45,462. This generates a serious problem for those seeking to calculate depreciation value for vehicles above the luxury car tax threshold, because the depreciation limit and the luxury tax threshold are no longer the same; that is, they are no longer both $45,462. At the very least, this legislation should have ensured that the luxury tax threshold remained at $45,462 retail, and at a deemed wholesale value of $31,564 for passenger vehicles. It is to be hoped that the Senate might address this issue by way of amendments so that the horrendous and unnecessary complexity of our sales tax laws does not now spill over into the law relating to depreciation allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Bill really shows is that the Government has learned nothing about the evils of the wholesale sales tax system in its nine years in office. Even if the Government did not abolish the wholesale sales tax system, as it would if it were serious about tax reform in this country, I would think that it would at least make some attempt to reduce its complexity by moving to reduce the number of sales tax rates and by removing some of the many anomalies in the system. Instead, we find the Government introducing further complexity into the system in the form of yet another sales tax rate for a particular class of vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has long been speculation that the Government would act to clean up the wholesale sales tax system. However, the trend to date has been very much in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members could be forgiven for not knowing it, but the Government announced a simplification review of the wholesale sales tax system in its 1990-91 Budget. This review was supposed to consider the amalgamation of the many sales tax assessment Acts and a reduction in the number of rating Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the wholesale sales tax legislation currently stands, it requires over 30 separate pieces of legislation. The review was also to consider sales tax relief for business inputs and the administration of our anomalous system of sales tax exemptions. Apart from some sales tax relief on business inputs in the March 1991 industry policy statement, we have yet to see anything of significance come out of the sales tax law simplification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill takes us in completely the opposite direction, in so far as it adds yet another rate to the sales tax law for a particular category of product and completely ignores the question of providing relief from sales tax for business users of motor vehicles. This Bill means that we can no longer take seriously the Government's professed desire to clean up the wholesale sales tax system and address tax law simplification more generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax simplification process seems to have disappeared from the scene, never to be heard from again. It shares the fate of the overall tax law simplification process that was supposedly initiated by the Government in February 1990 and of which we have heard virtually nothing since. The Government may now feel constrained to act in this way since any such moves would rightly be interpreted as vindicating the stance that the coalition has taken against the wholesale sales tax system for some considerable time. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence of this proposition was contained in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 13 February 1992 headed `Sales Tax Reform on Hold', which contained this particularly interesting paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministers preparing the statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about the One Nation economic statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">agreed the political risks associated with being seen as responding to the coalition's economic program outweighed any benefits in clearing up a tax system that the Government concedes privately is in a mess.</PARA>
<PARA>What a damning indictment of this Government's commitment to tax reform&mdash;as if any evidence were needed that this Government has simply given up the ghost on tax reform for the sake of political expediency. Anything less than the complete abolition of the wholesale sales tax system is a tax reform cop-out of unforgivable proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government appears to be determined to muddle through with the existing wholesale sales tax system, defying the logic of the rate reduction contained in this very Bill. This Bill is just another instalment in the ongoing fiasco that is the Government's handling of the sales tax treatment of passenger motor vehicles, and its abuse of the sales tax system, for political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House may recall the Government's reckless move to place a 50 per cent tax on so-called luxury vehicles ahead of the 1990 Federal election&mdash;a decision which eventually devastated the market for so-called luxury vehicles in Australia and had to be repealed in the March 1991 industry policy statement after the loss of many small businesses, much industry specific investment and hundreds of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the 50 per cent luxury car tax sought to grab votes amongst the Labor Party's traditional constituency at the 1990 Federal election, this sales tax measure seeks to buy the votes of small to medium car buyers ahead of the next election. This time the Government has gone about it in a slightly more satisfactory way, in that it is removing, rather than imposing, some of the existing sales tax impost on the relevant industry and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also avoided the debacle that occurred last time as a result of its attempt to legislate this 50 per cent luxury car tax by press release before Parliament resumed after the 1990 Federal election. The Government then sought to date the luxury car tax legislation from the date of proclamation, which was, appropriately enough, April Fools Day 1990. This was subsequently changed, again by press release, on 27 March 1990, and in the then proposed legislation, to a starting date of 1 May 1990. To say that this was responsible for a great deal of confusion is something of an understatement because dealers began to collect the tax, only to find that they were not able to collect the tax until a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even after 1 May 1990, dealers were forced into the position of collecting the tax at the new higher rate without the benefit of legislation which could make such collections legal. Thus many car dealerships were forced into breaking the law to benefit the revenue. To this end, the then Treasurer and present Prime Minister issued a further press release on 24 April 1990, which was designed to confer some sort of immunity from prosecution on those dealers who levied the tax at the new rate, regardless of what the law actually said. So much for the rule of law under this Government! The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office will not seek to penalise dealers who make provisions for, or remit, additional sales tax in anticipation of legislation being passed.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus the law of the land was swept aside by a mere piece of paper coming out of the then Treasurer's office, and the Australian Parliament was yet again reduced to a mere rubber stamp of the Executive Government's decision. Had the legislation actually been defeated in the Senate, for whatever reason, complete chaos would have reigned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When finally introduced, the luxury car tax introduced a serious disparity in the sales tax treatment of different vehicles on the thresholds of the new tax rates, which the Government then sought to address in the 1990-91 Budget. That Budget introduced a new split rate tax structure for passenger motor vehicles, which turned an existing administrative mess into a compliance nightmare of unprecedented proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new measures completely failed to arrest what was by then a free fall in sales in the high cost sector of the car industry. I recall this because many small business people who had luxury car dealerships are still suffering today as a result of the Government's politically motivated and misguided abuses of the sales tax law, despite the abolition of the luxury car tax in the March 1991 industry policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the industry policy statement it was recognised that it would take over three years for the luxury vehicle market to recover to the level it had reached in February 1990. It is to be hoped that car dealers and consumers will fare a little better under this latest proposed change to the sales tax law in relation to passenger motor vehicles, although, as I have already indicated, what is called for is the complete abolition of the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the rest of the wholesale sales tax system, it continues to act as a burden on business and consumers. It cannot be stressed often enough that the wholesale sales tax is a direct or indirect impost on the purchase of virtually every item of goods or service we may care to name. We had the Prime Minister in here the other day claiming that the wholesale sales tax system does not tax food. Yet it is clear that wholesale sales tax impacts on the costs of all food items, either directly, through a number of sales taxes on processed foods, or indirectly, through inputs into the production and distribution of food items. Professor John Freebairn, a professor of economics at Monash, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality, virtually every consumer good and service bears some wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar quote from Dr John Edwards, one of the Prime Minister's economic advisers, was read in the House by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) the other day. We would also do well to recall the words of Dr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, who examined the changing incidence of Federal indirect taxes since 1975-76 in a paper prepared for the Economic Planning and Advisory Council and circulated to all members of this Parliament. His findings about the changes in the incidence of wholesale sales tax that have occurred since 1984-85, in other words under this Government, are particularly damning. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the wholesale sales tax appear to have increased the regressivity of this tax, both through changes to the effective rates of the tax and from changes in other factors.</PARA>
<PARA>This conclusion again exposes the cant and hypocrisy of the Government in its attack on the equity of the goods and services tax proposal of the Opposition. At the same time as the Government mounts its scare campaign on the Fightback package, it is presiding over an increasingly regressive wholesale sales tax system that collected some $9.4 billion in revenue in the year 1990-91. The Labor Government collected some $627m in sales tax from my State of Western Australia alone in 1989-90. That amounts to nearly $400 a year for every man, woman and child in the State paid out to the Labor Government's hidden consumption tax coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The estimated sales value of those goods sold in Western Australia on which those taxes were levied was $3.66 billion in total. This translates into an average consumption tax on these sales of 17 per cent. I repeat that: that means that on those sales of goods in Western Australia there was levied an average of 17 per cent sales tax. More than 72 per cent of the gross sales of goods subjected to sales tax in Western Australia in that year were at the general sales tax rate of 20 per cent. These figures give the lie to the Government's claims about the incidence of wholesale sales tax and its effect on Australian consumers. Just as importantly is the effect it has on business. What has been pointed out to the Government in a memo to the Treasurer on 27 November 1991 by Dr Preston, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, is very illuminating. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct tax changes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the tax changes proposed by the coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would lead to a general reduction in industry costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is true and we have been able to quantify them. Under our proposals, Australian exporters will benefit by the removal of $1.7 billion in wholesale sales taxes alone. What will that mean for their competitiveness internationally, and what will that mean for their capacity to employ some of the one million people thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap by this Government?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business generally in Australia will be $20 billion better off up front under our proposals. That is not surprising because, amongst other things, we intend to abolish the payroll tax, the wholesale sales tax and the excise on fuel. That means jobs&mdash;jobs for Australian workers, jobs which have been destroyed by this present Government over nine long years, culminating in its deliberately engineered recession. It is about time the Government faced up to its responsibilities and abolished the wholesale sales tax system, lock, stock and barrel, as part of a genuine commitment to comprehensive tax reform in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a moment I got the impression that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was suggesting that the impost on ordinary people of the Opposition's proposed consumption tax would be less than the wholesale sales tax. He seemed to be indicating that the wholesale sales tax, if we measured all of the factors, presently represented a greater percentage than that of the present system. The point I would make very clearly is that a wholesale sales tax levied at 20 per cent on an item at $10 represents $2; a consumption tax levied at 15 per cent on the retail price at $20, which is a 100 per cent mark-up, the average for most retailers, represents $3. That needs to be understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But what we really had from the Opposition was a carping, complaining and moaning debate. The Opposition reluctantly accepts the fact that this will be good for the industry; it reluctantly accepts the fact that there may be some improvement in motor vehicle sales; it reluctantly accepts the fact that those in the industry applaud this measure. But it is bitterly disappointed because what this does is bring into very sharp focus the fact that, when it comes to levying tax on motor vehicles, what we have in place is a system whereby there is a differentiation between what is a luxury vehicle and what is a normal family vehicle. In fact, the luxury vehicle is taxed at a higher rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have done in this measure is make it perfectly clear to those people in Australia who will look very closely over the next year at the Opposition's proposed consumption tax that if it is the case that the Opposition ever gets into government, the normal family sedan that everybody wants to buy will be taxed at a higher rate than it is at the moment and the luxury car at the top end of the market will be taxed at a lower rate. It is very simple. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, understands it. The Opposition is about taxing the luxury car at a lower rate and taxing the family car at a higher rate. This proposal, part of the One Nation announcement of Tuesday night, indicates very clearly that that is going to be the case, and the Opposition does not like it. So Opposition members are whingeing and whining about the fact that the Government once again is making itself very starkly and very clearly differentiated from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Curtin chose to complain that in Australia we have high tariff barriers and that the car industry is protected. He said, in effect, `Isn't this a terrible thing?'. Really, the fact that the car industry has had these tariff barriers protecting it has made our car industry inefficient. Yet Opposition members, when in government, were the people who presided over the building of this structure. It has only ever been Labor governments in this country that have been about reforming industry and bringing down those tariff barriers. It is not easy to do. If an electorate is in the middle of Adelaide or on the outskirts of Melbourne, where the car industry is located, a government is very popular if it ramps up the tariffs and secures the employment of people who work in those places. But if a government is serious about restructuring this country, if it is serious about improving the efficiency of our industry, it has to take some hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good for the Opposition to come in here and cry about the fact that we have high tariff barriers, and whinge and moan about the fact that our industries are inefficient&mdash;when it did nothing about those things. Now that the Government is finally doing something, the Opposition starts to cry crocodile tears over the fact that Nissan has finally decided that it has an operation that is not viable and cannot be sustained in the long term. Therefore, it needs to set about a new way in which to market its vehicles and to manufacture in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd to expect that a country the size of Australia can have five or six car manufacturers producing 15 or 20 different models. When we came to government in 1983 we recognised that fact, and through the Button car plan and through a regulated and managed set of tariff reductions over a period of time, which allowed the industry to restructure itself and allowed the industry to be flexible and change its way of operation, we had the possibility of sustaining into the future a car industry which is efficient and which works. That will be done by improving the work practices in the car manufacturing industry, by assisting industry to make capital available and by making our industry much more competitive. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the direction that this Government is taking and that is why today in Melbourne Toyota announced the plan and the beginning of the building of a new car plant there with a capital expenditure of nearly half a billion dollars. That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was down there today. The reason Toyota has shown that sort of confidence, the reason Toyota is willing to spend the money on developing the capital equipment and to build what is going to be a state-of-the-art car manufacturing plant is that it understands the Government's commitment to tariff reductions, it understands the Government's commitment to restructuring the industry and it understands the Government's commitment to making progress in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular site has a prestart industrial agreement which is committed to world best practice manufacturing. On that site we have agreement that there will be a single bargaining unit for the unions. We have a multisectoral approach to work organisation. The parties are committed to international best practice. A single site award has been structured as part of that prestart industrial agreement. In sharp contradistinction to our opponents, we believe that those sorts of agreements need to be ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and that has taken place in respect of this prestart industrial agreement. What we have occurring there is a significant investment&mdash;nearly half a billion dollars&mdash;and we will have state-of-the-art manufacturing of motor vehicles in that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin also chose to talk long and hard about how unfair it was and how unreasonable it was that we should have differential rates of wholesale sales tax. I have already indicated that the reason for this is that it is appropriate for governments to target wholesale sales tax to those people who are most in need, and to target appropriately those wholesale sales taxes so that they provide incentives within their structure. If we look at like countries which have instituted a consumption tax of the nature which the Opposition is proposing, they have differential or split rates. They have a lower rate for food and clothing than they have for luxuries. Indeed, such is an appropriate way to go. Unfortunately, the Opposition, because of its ideological zealotry, has chosen not to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition really hates about this measure is that, as I have indicated, if and when the Opposition is ever able to introduce its proposals, it will mean that the family car will be taxed at a higher rate and the luxury car will be taxed at a lower rate. It is similar to the Opposition's proposal that the overseas holiday will be cheaper than the holiday taken within Australia. A person who chooses to travel up the Hawkesbury River, or wishes to visit Brisbane from Sydney, or perhaps venture as far as Western Australia, will pay a premium on his holiday. But for those who choose to go overseas and spend their time skiing in the Alps in France, or who wish to travel to the West Indies or, God forbid, to go on a safari in Africa, they will find that they have a cheaper holiday than people who choose to spend their money in this country. That is just another example of the way in which the proposals that the Opposition has put forward are unfair and are directed to the top end of town and not to those people who deserve the thoughtfulness and compassion of a government that cares for their welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most hysterical thing that the honourable member for Curtin had to say about this proposal&mdash;and he talked essentially about the Opposition's favoured consumption tax&mdash;was that the wholesale sales tax presented some sort of administrative nightmare, and that it was a monstrous imposition on business&mdash;on their resources, their time, their efficiency and their ability to do business. Nothing could be further from the truth. If we want to make those sorts of statements, we have to compare this proposal with the alternative, and the alternative which has been proposed by the Opposition is that, instead of having 75,000 businesses in this country which have to collect wholesale sales tax and levy it to the Government, we would have a consumption tax which would require nearly one million businesses to collect wholesale sales tax&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the proposal. The honourable member obviously does not understand if that is the way he thinks it will operate. That is the way it is proposed. Quite clearly, what this represents is an administrative nightmare. I had an opportunity a few months ago to speak at a seminar that was run by the Retail Traders Association of Western Australia. I had to go along there and debate the consumption tax with the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney)&mdash;of all people, that forgotten member of the Opposition, the one who played such a significant role in knifing John Howard in the back and bringing him down. Thank God for that because certainly that was very critical, I think, to our success in the last election. We are thankful to the honourable member for Pearce for that. But there I was sitting before a large audience of the Retail Traders Association. The marvellous thing was that this seminar was conducted and sponsored by an accountancy firm. I had an opportunity to talk to one of the principals of the firm as I was sitting there and I said to him, `I am not surprised that you guys are supporting this seminar because you would be very interested in a consumption tax'. He said to me, `Well, we hope it gets up because it will be a huge boost for business for us', and that is the case. Every accountant in the country knows it, and the honourable member for Curtin who comes from that profession understands very well that for those people in accountancy firms, those people who are involved in counting the numbers and shuffling the tax returns, it is going to be a huge boost to business.</PARA></TALK.START>

We noticed the other day, in fact, that he had a hole in the bottom of his shoe. He must be one of the few millionaires in the country with holes in the bottom of their shoes. But even his shoes will be more expensive under the Opposition's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin was correct&mdash;it was one of the few correct things he said&mdash;in that there is a small component of wholesale sales tax in every item that we buy. It filters down via osmosis, or however one wants to term it. With every item that we buy there is a small component of wholesale sales tax. But the difference is between 15 per cent and 2 or 3 per cent. Indeed, the Treasury figures show very clearly that the impact on clothing costs will be 11.2 per cent; on electricity costs, 10.7 per cent; on postal and telephone costs, 8.1 per cent; on health service charges&mdash;this is a huge one&mdash;22.6 per cent; and, on the CPI, 0.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of consequences which honourable members opposite do not want to own up to but which have been exposed as being real and which Australian voters will understand very well by the time they come to make a judgment at the next election. When we look at things such as dairy products, cereals, fresh fruit and vegetables, bread and meat, again we see that all these essentials of life, which presently are untaxed, will be subject to the impost of a consumption tax, thanks to the ideological zealotry of our opponents on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's initiative, which is contained in the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and is part of our proposal in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, will reduce the CPI. The estimated reduction in the CPI is 0.2 per cent&mdash;further evidence of this Government's effectiveness in fighting inflation. It will reduce the cost of a normal family car, in direct contradistinction to the proposal of honourable members opposite, which will increase the cost of the normal family sedan and decrease the cost of the Ferrari, the Mercedes and the BMW. That is the difference starkly brought into focus by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that members of the Opposition do not like this initiative, and I understand why they do not like it. They have been parading around this country saying that, in the best of all possible worlds&mdash;in the philosophy of Candide, if you like&mdash;everybody will be better off. But that is not the case. If one wants to buy a Ferrari one might be better off but, unfortunately, if one's choice of vehicle is a Toyota Corolla, those opposite will hit one for six.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we all know too well, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has recently made much of Britain's supposed betrayal of Australia in the lead-up to the fall of Singapore in 1942. Fittingly, others have rejected the Prime Minister's contention. Notable among these is the eminent historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey who, in an excellent article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 1 March, systematically exposed the Prime Minister's ignorance of his own nation's wartime history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pointed out by Professor Blainey that Britain did defend Singapore to the limit of her available resources. In doing so, he instanced the tragic loss off the Malay Peninsula of the major British ships HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prince of Wales</EMPHASIS> and HMS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Repulse</EMPHASIS> and the tens of thousands of British troops who were stationed in the area. In fact, 38,490 British troops were taken as prisoners of war, alongside the 15,400 Australians mentioned in Professor Blainey's article, when Singapore finally fell to the Japanese. Even more important is the fact that a besieged Britain was valiantly attempting to stem the Nazi tide in Europe, with significant help from only the older dominions such as Australia and Canada, since Europe had, for the most part, fallen to Nazi occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be pointed out that Prime Minister Keating is clearly not aware of the failure of Australia's wartime Labor Prime Minister, John Curtin, to properly discharge his responsibilities to Australian troops on at least one major occasion. Prime Minister Curtin's insistence on bringing Australian troops back from the Middle East in early 1942 is a commonly known fact. What is not generally known is that he instructed that thousands of these troops were to be landed prematurely on the island of Java, against the specific advice of the commanding General, General Lavarack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 February 1942 General Lavarack, through General Sturdee, pleaded with Prime Minister Curtin to allow the force to return to Australia to reload and re-equip tactically. At that stage the force did not have its heavy weapons and equipment or its transport, all of which followed in a slower ship accompanied by essential administrative personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was that, acting under pressure from the local Dutch administration, upon the specific order of John Curtin and the War Cabinet, Black Force, comprising 3,400 soldiers brought from the Middle East, landed in Java on 18 February 1942 to fight the Japanese&mdash;some soldiers being armed only with pickaxe handles. According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">High Command</EMPHASIS> by D. M. Horner, on page 164, Lavarack's ADC wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that General Lavarack could do was express dissent and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not to deny that, overall, Prime Minister Curtin performed an acutely difficult task to the best of his ability as wartime Prime Minister of Australia, as did Winston Churchill, in an exemplary fashion, for Britain. So, it also must be fairly said, did the Prime Ministers of other dominions at that time. In fact, it should be remembered that in the early stages of World War II the older members of what is now the Commonwealth of Nations, namely, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, were the civilised world's only bulwark against tyranny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this common strength in adversity which should be recalled by all of us, including Prime Minister Keating&mdash;not the histrionics and selective interpretation of history, if not outright invention of history, which has been indulged in by a section of the so-called Australian intelligentsia over a lengthy period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the House about the murder of a fine young man, Louis St John Johnson. Louis Johnson was murdered on 4 January this year. He died on his nineteenth birthday as he was returning home alone from a party. According to the police, he was a victim of an unprovoked, brutal, calculated racist attack which resulted in his death. The police were advised that, after being assaulted, Louis was then deliberately run over by a car and received multiple and extensive internal injuries. He lay in shock and pain for four hours beside a busy road before a passing cyclist called for an ambulance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday someone was convicted in the Perth Children's Court for the murder of Louis St John Johnson. This person received seven years and nine months. Standing order 75 does not permit me to comment upon the judiciary.

I am sure that people who think about this will wonder whether we have our values correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue is that Louis St John Johnson was not taken to hospital. I wonder why he was not taken to hospital. Perhaps it was because he was black; perhaps it was because he was diagnosed as being a petrol sniffer when, in fact, he was far from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Louis St John Johnson was adopted by Bill and Pauline Johnson in Darwin in May 1973. He was 4 1/2 months old. In historic perspective his parents say they now realise that they unwittingly participated in a governmental policy of removing Aboriginal children from their families without parental consent. Louis's mother did not consent to his adoption; he was merely taken away like so many thousands of others. For our part, the Johnsons say that they apologise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inasmuch as an Aboriginal child in a middle class white society can be said to have experienced a happy childhood, Louis can be so described. Until he reached the age of 14 years, he enjoyed school immensely, travelled widely at home and overseas and pursued all the usual family, social and sporting activities of those in his age group. From 14 years onwards, Louis began to experience identity problems, rejection by his peers and social prejudice. He found insurmountable problems in starting to build a future for himself, when he did not know where he came from or who he was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the parents accompanied Louis to the Northern Territory, Darwin and Alice Springs, in an attempt to put him in touch with his roots and to make contact with his own family. This endeavour was frustrated by the community welfare department which refused to release any information despite an explicit request from Louis and the parents. Four years of loneliness and pain marked Louis's final years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew him to have been a fine young man. I thought one of the pieces of poetry which was read during his funeral service perhaps tells the story. It is from Archie Roach, and states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deduction for the allowance will be additional to depreciation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a significant bonus to those few eligible companies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regal generally competes against much larger players, some of which are multinationals. They typically spend around $2m to $5m on new plant and equipment when they believe new production lines are called for. Regal is concerned that this new measure might give some of its competitors a commercial advantage, despite the leaner management structures that typically help small companies in the lowering of their unit costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even smaller companies than Regal will be indirectly affected by such a blatant measure which is part of this Bankcard based statement. Coghlan-Russell Engineering in Geelong supplies industrial consumables as well as automotive components. It employs 50 people and seems to have weathered the recession quite well. Its concern is that the costs of doing business continue to rise. At least 144 separate costs  directly affect small business in Australia&mdash;an A to Y list ranging from annual leave loading through to youth training. That is Coghlan-Russell's real worry about staying in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coghlan-Russell Engineering is perhaps fortunate in that it does not have the immediate threat of competition from much larger companies. However, it asks why the $110m that the development allowance is anticipated to cost from 1994 to 1996 could not be directed towards the abolition of payroll tax, after consultation with the States. For Coghlan-Russell, payroll tax is an impediment that can delay the installation of new plant and equipment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has sold his own Party and Australian farming families an imported lemon. Over the last few months we have seen the Leader of the National Party force the consumption tax onto a suspicious National Party and onto the farm sector. We now discover that over 60 per cent of farming and self-employed households will be worse off if it ever comes to pass that the Opposition is able to implement a tax on food and clothing. It is important to recognise that the Deputy Leader of the National Party, in a radio interview just recently, made the following comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average farm income is less than $20,000 and the Government's proposal to income tax does not touch the 40 per cent of the poorer Australians, which includes farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the National Party going to do? Will it touch the farmers? It sure will; it will king hit them with a 15 per cent tax. This is not a Fightback package; it is a king hit. It is a king hit for all farming families who, because of the drought or the floods in Queensland, will have no crops this year and have had no crops for the past two years. Farmers have had to absorb poor commodity prices over the last two or three years, with virtually no disposable income, no cash. Under the package of those opposite, they will have to pay a tax of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a con job. I think farmers will start to wake up. It is a cowardly tax. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) said earlier that bringing in the Fightback package showed courage. There is not much courage in a king hit and there is not much courage in putting a tax on food and clothing for low income people and for farmers who are struggling at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated price effects of the consumption tax, which I think are important, show quite clearly that the price of dairy products, for instance, will increase by 9.6 per cent&mdash;that is without road user charges; the price of cereal products will increase by 9.2 per cent; and of course the price of fresh fruits and vegetables will increase by 10.1 per cent. That is a conservative estimate. This means that the battling farmers who the National Party has pretended to represent will be the ones who will cop the tax. As I have said, this package should be referred to as a king hit, not a Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go on to look at taxation, we hear the prattle that those opposite will reduce taxation for low income families from 21 per cent to 16 per cent. But what has not been realised or thought through is that families will pay a 15 per cent consumption tax on top of that. The majority of people who pay 21 per cent tax do not have much disposable income; there is not much money left after rearing families. Through the family allowance supplement, we have put a net underneath those people. But under the Opposition's policy, those people will find that they are not paying just 16 per cent tax, but 16 per cent tax on their income and 15 per cent tax on everything they consume and every service that they use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us assume that 90 per cent of people's disposable income is already committed; they will be paying 31 per cent, not 21 per cent, in tax. The people at the bottom end of the market will be discriminated against under a goods and services tax. One need only go to Canada to see how popular the goods and services tax is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ensuing months both sides of this House will have the opportunity to debate these issues. It is certainly already clear that some members of the back bench on the other side are starting to worry as the pressure is applied. Those opposite have no chance whatsoever of selling a tax of 15 per cent on food and clothing in order to give tax breaks to the top end of town. This clearly indicates that the policies put forward by the Opposition are based on special privilege. Nothing has ever changed. This will be a clear indication, as we run into the next election some time next year, of a clear choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to raise a number of questions which are in urgent need of an answer. Since Labor came to office in 1983, the position of Australia, both relatively and absolutely, has declined steadily. Today, Australians are poorer than they were a decade ago. When our economic performance is measured in international terms we barely make the second eleven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australia's dismal decline into banana republicanism is the fault of this so-called Labor Government. The continued pandering of its opportunistic leadership to big unions, big business and unrepresentative sectional interest groups, such as the ACF and the welfare industry, has impoverished not simply the productive capacity of the nation, but the spirit of its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against this alarming background that I wish to raise a number of issues which are fundamental to the future of this country. In contrast to the usual Government tactics of bluff and innuendo, my questions are simple and package-free. When is the Government going to govern?  Either the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is completely ignorant of the proper function of the Parliament or he has decided to hijack the parliamentary process in a relentless quest to further his own selfish ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is the Government going to address the problems of our overseas debt&mdash;now a massive $183 billion? When is the Government going to get off the back of the productive sector? How can business compete when it is completely shackled by the chains of government taxes and charges? Last year, an MTIA survey found that government taxes and charges, together with transport and communications costs, represented 12 per cent of total operating costs and 415 per cent of after-tax profits. Wholesale sales tax, company tax and payroll tax alone accounted for more than 4 per cent of total operating costs and 150 per cent of after-tax profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is the Government going to admit that its policies since 1983 have been wrong? After 16 economic statements&mdash;no doubt costing taxpayers millions of dollars&mdash;Australia is engulfed by a depression which may well be more tragic in its consequences than the Great Depression of the 1930s. When is the Government going to tell the unemployed that they will probably still be unemployed beyond the year 2000? When is the Government going to tell the truth about youth unemployment? It is totally dishonest to claim it is only 8 per cent when the CES admits to 30 per cent, and in Dunkley&mdash;my electorate&mdash;it is 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is the Government going to tell the nation that it has destroyed the productive sector and bankrupted thousands of Australia's farms and businesses? When is it going to admit that the wheels have well and truly come off the ridiculous car plan? Despite what the Prime Minister said today about motor car exports, Australia is now making fewer cars than 20 years ago, while importing more. When is the Government going to give the nation a decent health service? Why are 60,000 Australians waiting for a bed in a public hospital when there are empty beds and excellent services available in the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation is drowning in a sea of debt. And what does the One Nation manifesto give us? It gives us more debt and an even deeper sea to drown in. The package should be renamed `One Drowning Nation'. What does the Prime Minister ask us to believe? That this, Labor's sixteenth, economic statement will make Archimedes leap out of his bath shouting, `Eureka! The right formula at last!'. If honourable members opposite believe that, more fool them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of this nation have a perfect right to ask: what is going on in Canberra; what is going on in this Parliament? Basically, there is more and more talking and there are completely futile attacks on the coalitions's Fightback program instead of proper consideration of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day the Government resorts to spurious attacks on bracket creep instead of debate on the creep who got us into this mess. But as every day goes by and Australia sinks further into debt, we see less and less attention to government and less and less attention to those we are here to represent. Labor is still trying desperately to find a flaw in Fightback. However, those opposite do not seem to realise that the numbers are sound. What they are quite clearly incapable of doing is attacking the package from a philosophical point of view. Why? Because they all know that this is what Australians want. They want a new vision for the future and a blueprint for the restoration of economic prosperity and national pride. Only Fightback will achieve this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, bumper bars. The Minister is well aware of it; no doubt he is interested in the issue too. The report talks about the research that has been carried out into five small cars that are available to Australian motorists: the Holden Barina, the Ford Laser, the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Pulsar and the Honda Civic. The report is quite frightening in some ways because it goes to the issue of the costs in accident repairs. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each year Australian motorists are being saddled with an accident repair bill of more than $283 million for damage that need not occur according to research</PARA>
<PARA>It talks about nose-to-tail accidents. Researchers have carried out studies and found that not one of these cars can actually take a smack in the rear or in the front at anything more than eight kilometres per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite serious because the cost of each accident averaged around $2,000. If one looks at the front-and-back accidents&mdash;AAMI tested the vehicles at both ends&mdash;one will find that they range from $3,286.42 to $5,033.33. The study points out that there are some 7.6 million cars on the road; 11 per cent of these&mdash;that is, 836 cars&mdash;are involved in accidents each year. The insurance claims represent some $2 billion. Something like 40 per cent of that money is involved in the replacement part industry, which we know often overprices. It is a $909m business just in parts, of which $636m is in new parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study goes on to point out that 46 per cent of all the claims are either nose-to-tail claims or are caused by people failing to give way. We are talking about a massive cost to the community because we have not addressed the problem of having sufficient quality bumper bars. This issue is not new. It was back in 1915 that cars first had bumper bars; they were optional. We see today that people have bull bars to try to protect their cars. We have small cars that simply are not able to do their job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with AAMI that there is now a strong case for the Government to introduce an Australian design standard rule that makes it mandatory for Australian cars to be fitted with bumpers that are able to withstand impacts up to eight kilometres per hour without damage. If we could do this&mdash;and I think it is an issue which cuts across all the political parties and the boundaries&mdash;it is going to lower the insurance premiums. That is going to mean a saving to every motorist and, importantly, it is going to maintain the value of cars. There is nothing worse than a person having a car and pranging it in part or having a major prang. Not only does this destroy the owner's attitude to the car, but it also destroys the value.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to take notice of what AAMI is saying here. I think it is very important that action be taken by having an Australian design rule. So I would urge the Government to take up this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has been published by the Monash University. It provides the statistical information that one needs to verify the outcomes. It argues very strongly in the interest of motorists, consumers and, I think, the nation generally. Think what could happen in the future if ever we have a GST&mdash;and just think the costs are going to blow out. We are talking about $900m now. Under the Opposition there is going to be a tax on those parts that are used. There is going to be a 15 per cent tax on the repairs. There is even going to be a tax on the pick-up truck that comes along to get it. There will be a tax on the assessment of the damage. We are not going to talk about $2 billion in damages; we are going to talk about a massive blow-out in cost. Not only because of the risk of the GST from the Opposition, but because it would also be good for the community, the insurance industry, the motorist and the insured we ought to act on the matter. As we have a very responsible Minister here, the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who understands this issue, I hope the matter can be taken to the high levels so that we can get this Australian design rule introduced to ensure that the car companies that provide cars for Australian motorists ensure that the bumpers withstand impacts at least up to eight kilometres per hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has been charged with coordinating the development of the plan. An interdepartmental committee, which has access to extensive expertise, has been established to assist in this process. In addition to the Department of Health Housing and Community Services, my Department and AIDAB, the following are also members of that committee: the Departments of Social Security, Finance, the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Attorney-General; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Office of the Status of Women and the Australian Institute of Family Studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The plan is in its initial developmental phase. The inter-departmental committee has met on three occasions, in November and December 1991 and in February 1992. It is envisaged that an interim report will be completed by the end of March 1992 and the final report in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The plan will reflect both Government policy and the content of the Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Consultations with relevant non-governmental organisations will be undertaken. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has written to national peak bodies advising them of the arrangements in place to develop the plan and indicating his intention to consult with them in its development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) As outlined in (b) above, a final plan of action is scheduled for completion by the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) A decision about tabling the plan in Parliament has not yet been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) In response to the Declaration, in 1991-92 Australia increased its core contribution to UNICEF by $400,000 to $4.1 million, and contributed an additional $300,000 to international health programs related to women and children. Previously, Australia also expended $1.25 million on the purchase of the rights to solar weighing scales for UNICEF, also in response to the Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, it is not possible to give all 1991-92 allocations relevant to Declaration goals because allocations are made by country and by channel of aid, rather than by sector. However, AIDAB has analysed 1990-91 expenditure which could be considered relevant to each goal, as outlined below. It is expected that 1991-92 figures would not be lower than these levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of specific goals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) Projects and programs directed at the goals of improved nutrition, maternal and child health account for around $30 million, or 2% of total ODA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Expenditure on rural water supply and sanitation projects was $12 million, or about 1% of Australia's development assistance in 1990-91 (although in recent years such expenditure has more usually been about 2% of ODA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Australia's proportion of ODA spent on education was 21% in 1990-91. Direct support to primary and basic education amounted to approximately 1% of that, which is 0.2% of ODA or about $2.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) Australia assists children in difficult circumstances such as refugees, victims of disasters, and victims of apartheid. In 1990-91, Australia contributed a total of $64.3 million for emergency and refugee programs, a significant proportion of which, approximately $51 million, is estimated to be of direct benefit to children and their mothers. This represents 4% of our aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall in 1990-91, this analysis showed that about $95 million or 7.5% of ODA is directed to one or more goals of the Declaration. This does not include expenditure in projects in the area of agriculture, rural development, poverty alleviation, or food aid, which also assist in raising health and nutritional levels of mothers and their children. Moreover, because such a large proportion of Australian aid is committed to Papua New Guinea budget support and payment to multi-lateral development banks, adjusted analysis which omits these from the denominator of total ODA raises the proportion of the remaining aid budget allocated to Declaration goals to about 12.5%. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) The effect of anti-locking brakes on improving vehicle safety is to make a vehicle behave in a more predictable manner when the brakes are applied, under heavy braking. Antilocking brakes prevent the vehicle's wheels from completely locking when the brakes are applied no matter how hard the driver applies the brakes. As long as the wheels continue to rotate, the vehicle remains controllable and will respond predictably to steering action by the driver. Anti-locking brakes are particularly useful on wet roads, and in snowy and icy conditions. By comparison, vehicles fitted with conventional brakes could experience wheellock during heavy braking, and the vehicle then becomes difficult to control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The effect of airbags on improving vehicle safety is to offer front seat occupants added protection in the event of a frontal impact. In Australia, where the seat belt wearing rate is 80 per cent to 90 per cent, airbags can provide supplementary protection for front seat occupants restrained by seat belts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates vary, with some researchers claiming that when airbags are used in conjunction with lap shoulder seat belts, the combination has the potential to further reduce fatalities by 3 per cent to 5 per cent. This estimate is based on expert judgement and not on statistical methods applied to crash injury data. The statistical sample upon which this study was based did not contain crash data involving airbag equipped vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other research based on actual crash data involving airbag equipped vehicles, the airbag when used alone is credited with reducing the fatality risk by about 21 per cent and when used together with lap shoulder belts by about an additional 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research also shows that the combination of airbags and improved technology seat belts may be able to provide up to 15 per cent reduction in fatal injury risk beyond that provided by standard lap shoulder belts. This estimate is based on the assumption that the seat belt usage rate is 100 per cent. If the less optimistic seat belt usage rate of 80 per cent is used, this research points out that a 5 per cent improvement may be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airbags can provide additional protection against injury in frontal and near frontal impacts. Research currently underway on behalf of the Government is seeking to identify the total reduction in road trauma (including injuries and fatalities) that can be expected in Australia, with various combinations of restraint improvements. This is expected to be published by the middle of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their current form, airbags are less effective in side impacts and not able to prevent ejections from the vehicle, and are less effective than seat belts in roll-overs, and multiple collisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airbags are designed to fit into the steering wheel hub or dashboard and inflate when a crash occurs. Airbags protect the front seat occupants from contact with hard objects such as the steering wheel and dashboard, cushioning the impact during the crash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airbags are just one of the approaches that can be taken to improve overall passenger protection in passenger cars. Other measures such as better seat belts, ``soft'' steering wheels, and improved structural design all need to be considered in arriving at the best package for Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The differential wholesale sales tax increases from 20 per cent to 30 per cent for vehicles which cost more than $30,505 (wholesale); I understand that this corresponds to a retail price of $45,462.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The safety standards for vehicles imported or supplied to the Australian market are set out in the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Design Rules which are specified as standards under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. These set out a comprehensive range of safety features, and are generally equivalent to safety requirements in Europe and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fitting of additional safety features over and above those required by the Motor Vehicle Standards Act is a question of the commercial judgement of the individual manufacturer or importer. I understand that some importers of luxury European cars offer various models with or without additional safety features, although those are not currently required under European or Australian regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government is concerned about road safety and has committed significant resources towards research to ensure that Australian vehicle safety standards are amongst the best in the world.</PARA>

The National Road Trauma Advisory Council has considered the sales tax applying to vehicle safety items. I understand that the Council is to recommend to the Government that innovative vehicle safety items such as airbags and high technology seat belts supplied over and above the requirements in vehicle safety standards should be exempt from sales tax. The issue of sales tax exemptions will be considered when the Council's final report has been received.</PARA>
