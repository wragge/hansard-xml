<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This proposal has arisen out of the Committee's desire to emphasise the significant change in the focus of the Committee's activities that has occurred since the introduction of self-government in the ACT, and to reflect more accurately the Committee's new responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee on the ACT was first established in November 1956. Until the ACT became self-governing, the Committee was concerned primarily with matters relating to the detailed planning and development of the Territory. Much of its work involved the examination of proposals to vary the plan of the road layout of Canberra. The Committee's responsibility now, after the introduction of self-government in the Territory, is not to examine road variations or other municipal matters, but to focus on issues relating to the national significance of Canberra. Matters of particular local or Territory-wide significance are now considered, as they should be, by the Territory Government and not by a committee of the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the Committee's work in the current Parliament has reflected its interest in Canberra as the national capital. The Committee has conducted two inquiries into the development of the national capital. It has examined aspects of Canberra's national and arterial road systems in assessing the transport options prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority for the new town of Gungahlin, and most recently the Committee has reviewed the first proposed amendment to the national capital plan. In addition, the Committee will soon begin an inquiry into environmental management policies and practices in those areas of open space in the Territory that are of national significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through its work in this Parliament, the Committee has established itself as the parliamentary guardian of those aspects of Canberra which contribute to its character as the national capital. This responsibility is embodied in the Committee's resolution of appointment, which charges the Committee with the task of inquiring into, and reporting on, the national capital plan and any amendments to the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although many of the individuals and organisations with whom the Committee deals frequently are aware of the Committee's new focus, it has become evident that some people are either unaware that a change has occurred or are now uncertain about the Committee's role. A change of name from the Joint Committee on the ACT to the Joint Committee on the National Capital would help overcome this uncertainty. In particular, it would emphasise the fact that there has been a change in the Committee's focus and indicate more clearly the Committee's new responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to formalise the change of name, the Committee recommends that the Government move a motion in the House proposing that the Committee be known as the Joint Committee on the National Capital. As well as proposing the name change, the motion should provide for the current membership of the Committee to be continued and for the new Committee to continue the work of the Joint Committee on the ACT.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this motion moved by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), I would point out at the outset that Australia is a very dry continent and water is obviously very important. Because of Australia's dryness, our waterways are doubly precious compared with those overseas. In much of this continent the volume of water that rivers carry is small compared with world standards. This is especially so in droughts when the flow of rivers can almost stop even in our biggest river systems. This summer we found ourselves in another drought situation in eastern Australia, especially in southern Queensland and the north and west of New South Wales. At one stage we were faced with the largest blue-green algae outbreak in Australia's, if not the world's, history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, I believe, was a symptom of a more serious degradation of our waterways. We have come to recognise that there are many types of algae in our river systems normally, not all of them toxic. The ones that were causing concern mainly centred around the blue-green anabaena algae where you can have up to 5,000 cells per millilitre and still remain safe. However, with recent outbreaks, concentrations went up to 500,000 cells per millilitre. Of course, none of this is new. I believe there was a report in one of the British medical journals back in 1879 recording the first stock deaths in South Australia from algal poisoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation we faced in early December in this country was that in New South Wales we had four river systems infected at a serious level. The Darling River system was infected over 1,000 kilometres from Mungindi to Wilcannia and the algae were spreading south rapidly. The Hawkesbury system had algal blooms near Sydney. The Murrumbidgee River was infected near Hay and Balranald and the Williams River near Newcastle. In Victoria we had the Tooborac water supply infected and Lake Wallace in the western districts, and also Lake Mokoan. In Queensland the Condamine River had algal blooms and in Western Australia the Peel River near the Harvey Inlet, 90 kilometres south of Perth, had a nodularia strain of blue-green algae. In South Australia Lake Alexandria was hit earlier last year. The summer before, of course, in New South Wales the water supply at Lake Cargelligo was affected, as were the Chaffey Dam near Tamworth, Lake Keepit near Gunnedah, Lake Glenbawn near Muswellbrook and also the Carcoar Dam. I believe that is a warning to us that blue-green algae outbreaks have the potential to become the major water resource management issue of the 1990s and beyond, and there is a great need for research and assessment to understand and best manage this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The phenomenon of blue-green algae outbreaks is imperfectly understood. It is a combination of many things, including temperature and stagnant water. If the water is clear, in other words not turbulent and muddy, it allows the release of nutriments. Under these conditions the algae grow profusely, particularly if the volume of the water is down so that the concentration of these nutriments is increased. The main nutriment in this is phosphorus. Phosphorus is a main source of food for the algae and they also need nitrogen, although the anabaena algae can fix their own nitrogen from the atmosphere. Work is being done at the moment on determining necessary phosphorus testing levels and also trying to identify the source of this phosphorus in the river systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is exacerbated by the absence of natural filters in the rivers. The river beds of our waterways normally have plant growth which utilises this phosphorus. However, various things such as European carp have eaten or destroyed many of our reed systems and this has exacerbated the problem. Also we have had in many areas a degradation of vegetation along river banks. I acknowledge that it is hard to do much about that but we are going to have to revise our practices with our river banks and perhaps look to planting more trees along them and preserving those trees that we already have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were fortunate that this was a cooler summer than normal. The rains that we have had, particularly recently, have stirred up the water, lowered the temperature, broken up the algae and in many areas flushed them away. We have to do, of course, much more work on determining the source of these nutriments. It appears that the main culprit is the sewerage outlets. Country cities may have to look to tertiary treating of their sewage, which is not done now except in the Canberra-Queanbeyan area, where they discharge only 0.5 parts per million of phosphorus into the river system. In other inland cities, where they do not engage tertiary treatment, the concentration can be up to 30 times higher than that. The sewage from cities like Dubbo, Tamworth, Wagga, Orange, Bathurst and Albury eventually flows into the Murray-Darling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Run-off, of course, is an important consideration. Animal manure from sheep and cattle flows into the rivers, and certain fertilisers such as superphosphate, which is mainly spread in the tableland areas and not in the western division of New South Wales, flow into these rivers too and there is a build-up over many years of sediments which are released under certain conditions. Of course, overgrazing&mdash;grazing right to the edges of the river banks&mdash;and irrigation run-off can aggravate this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But having said that, I want to say something about the cotton industry, because it has been blamed when I believe it is not the culprit that many people think it is. There is little or no run-off from cotton now. Most cotton plantations are flood protected and have had irrigation tail water return systems in place for a long time and they indeed use very small amounts of phosphorous fertilisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main downside from cotton growing is that they pump the river levels low and decrease the flow and, in that manner, increase the concentration of the nutriments. But chemical monitoring now goes on near cotton plantations and the algal blooms are often in river systems thousands of kilometres away from where cotton is grown. Of course, the main cotton rivers, the Macintyre, the Namoi and the Gwydir have had no blue-green algae growing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity to inspect some of this blue-green algae, particularly in the Darling River system, and the only green that you could see up there in that drought stricken area around Tilpa where I went, was the river itself. It looked like pea soup that had been through a blender, floating around on top of the river as well as having blue colonies of actively growing algae. But even there I was surprised to see the fish were still jumping out of the water and the stock losses were almost zero, so it poses the question of just how serious this algae problem is. I do not think that even that basic question is yet answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, what should we do? In the short term there is little we can do. We have fortunately had the flushing effect from rain. We can look at releasing water from dams. The New South Wales Government has sunk 10 bores between Bourke and Wilcannia and, putting that water through activated carbon filters has ensured clean town water and clean stock water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term we have to do more work on the nutriments and the sediments which may, of course, be there for decades. We have to look to vegetating banks and be conscious of nutriment run-off. We could consider the use of artificial aeration of water in dams to break up the layering or thermal stratification of the system, such as pumping oxygen into the base of the dams, which has been done in some areas. Biological control needs to be looked at, including cyanophages or algae eaters. We have to monitor food and plant webs in the river systems and perhaps do research on enzymes to neutralise the toxins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national task force has been set up which has to be properly funded, so that it can prepare action programs for the consideration for the future on how we should manage nutriments and run-off. We also have to coordinate the States into a federal system better than we have, so that they are not all acting in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the summer that we have had has given us a very serious warning of what a massive problem this can be. More needs to be done in the future.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the most important issues facing Australia. I think it is good that this debate is taking place because the environment has been hijacked in Australia in the past by people who promoted issues which were really not of any great consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that water, water quality, and the associated problems with soil erosion and salinity are the number one pollution problem in Australia&mdash;the number one environmental problem. I would say that it is followed by problems of city pollution. It is an indictment of our sundry environmental groups that they have spent so much time looking at trees and attacking forestry when, in fact, we have in Australia probably the best forest management in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blue-green algae are clearly a problem. One of the great dangers of this is that if we do not get on top of this problem very quickly, it will be taken over by the environmental movement and it will become the cause of the moment. As the dire threats of greenhouse warming are shown to be false and not supported by the available evidence&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, is wrong. If she reads all the material, she will find that I am in fact absolutely right. As that occurs, I think there is a chance that these people in the environmental movement will move into the blue-green algae field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems caused with algae is that you often do get a lot of death of fish and stock when algae die&mdash;even when they are not toxic algae. This can be caused through a sudden increase in turbidity in the water, cutting down photosynthesis. What happens there is that they simply absorb all the oxygen from the water and the fish die as a consequence. It is rather interesting that when this has occurred on occasions on the Ord River, people have blamed chemicals used by the horticulture industry there. The real problem was in fact the rotting in the water of vegetation which, like algae, is tied into photosynthesis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the blue-green algae, it is quite clear that the main cause of nutrient enrichment is sewage from towns. We do have to take this seriously. We have to make sure that there is tertiary treatment of effluent and that calcium is removed. There are many ways of doing this and I am sure there are chemical processes. I know that in the area of the Nullarbor, where I have spent a lot of time and where we have a phosphorus deficiency, it is caused because of the redness of calcium, which locks up phosphorus. It may be possible to lock up phosphorus simply by locking it to insoluble calcium phosphates. In any case, this must be tackled, and tackled as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture is a peripheral cause. I think this is a very good case for supporting the proposals put forward from the Riverland for a campaign for clean food from a clean country. I think it is a very exciting program and it seeks to sell our product at a premium by assuring the world that we are using the minimum of chemicals, we are using the minimum water and that our product is grown under the best possible environmental conditions&mdash;conditions that will give you sustainable agriculture. Clearly, it is a waste. Farmers are costing themselves money if nutrient that they apply to the ground has been washed into rivers, and this is something which we must be careful of. I think it will call for much more careful soil testing to see whether applications of fertiliser are absolutely necessary, and at what levels they should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the opportunity does exist for making a big impact on this problem. Given the nature of Australia, we are always going to have periods of recurring drought and there is no doubt that this problem occurs most when river levels are low. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) pointed out, it is this that tends to concentrate the nutrient in the available water. So we are going to have to look at better control of river flows, perhaps by better manipulation of dam levels, but in any case there are limits as to how much Australia can do that, given our shortage of rain. Water is a big problem for our cities and it is something of which Australia has become very much preoccupied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we do not go overboard and be panicked. There is, after all, abundant water for our cities, and this is contained in our oceans. At the present level of technology, desalination of sea water costs something around $1.80 a kilolitre. It is expensive by present standards, but the cost will decrease as technology improves. I foresee that we will get that cost down to a level which would certainly be justified for city consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because water is such an emotional problem in Australia, we tend to get fed from time to time the snake oil solution. We have one of those in Western Australia right now where the State Government is, in fact, committed to spending $3m to research carrying river water from the Ord River to Perth. The proposal is to take it to Perth via a pipeline that will cost us some $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing how much support this has. The Government&mdash;and I might say the Opposition is equally as culpable because it too has gone along with this undoubted snake oil scheme&mdash;has gone out and asked people, `Would you like to have an assured supply of water in Perth from the Ord River?'. People then say, `Yes, of course I would', and you have an overwhelming response from people saying yes. However, if the question was, `Would you like an assured supply of water from the Ord River at prices which you cannot afford?', the answer would have been no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the very best estimate of the cost of that water, if you discount the capital costs, is something between $3.50 and $4 a kilolitre. That is if you discount the capital costs of something like $9 billion to get it there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visionaries say to me, `Ah, but you have no vision. Do you not see the towns springing up along the road? Do you do not see along the length of this pipeline the new settlements producing irrigated produce?'. I must say here that this overlooks the fact that we would have trouble selling such produce at the moment, but they are potential markets for the future. They say to me, `Do you not see Australia being greened in the centre?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there are mechanical limitations to what a pipeline can carry because water cannot be compressed. A pipeline of 1.6 metres diameter will carry about 50 million cubic metres of water to Perth per year. That is enough water to irrigate 50 square kilometres of land to a depth of one metre. Given that the evaporation rate over a lot of my electorate is two or three times that, in reality it would be possible to irrigate something less than 20 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty square kilometres is not very much and from an aeroplane it would be very hard to find. Once the water was used to irrigate these towns to the extent of 20 square kilometres, there would not be any water left for Perth, never mind water for Adelaide. The proponents of the scheme only make it work by using the water in one place, shoving it back into the pipe, and taking it to be used somewhere else. It is a nonsense scheme and I think it is absolutely appalling that the State Government and the State Opposition are supporting the use of $3m of taxpayers' money to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said to me, `Ah, but if it was not for the pipeline you would not be existing in Kalgoorlie'. That is nonsense. In 1900 when it was decided to start that pipeline, Kalgoorlie was the booming centre of Western Australia. It was paying, in 1900, a shilling a gallon for water. It made sense to put a pipeline in, and bear in mind that the Kalgoorlie pipeline is only about 550 kilometres whereas we are talking about a pipeline of four times that length. Remember, the Water Authority of Western Australia has clearly shown that length is important to the economics of a pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the pipeline did in the goldfields was to reduce the cost of water and gave an assured supply of water. It was of enormous benefit. It will be a pity if we are blinded by this great achievement and support the nonsense being put forward by certain people at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this motion put forward by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). Water as we know is one of our most precious resources but Australia being the country that it is, a land of contrasts, means we have either too much or too little. We have too much rain in the north of Australia or we have too little in the south of Australia. We have drought conditions throughout many areas of Australia at this moment while at the same time we also have flooding in this vast country of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a very arid country in many parts of it. We have a small strip around the coast where there is adequate rainfall and where there are adequate water supplies, but we either have too much rain in the north or too little in the south, or vice versa depending on the season. The variation of rainfall throughout this country means it is extremely difficult to calculate and is never consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rainfall generally falls too close to the coast where we have little ability to store or conserve that water. Many of our northern rivers are of short length and the rainfall that falls in many of those areas flows out to sea. We have too little rain in many areas of the inland, too little rain to enable a harvest to take place or to supplement the water supply in towns in the inland parts of Australia. We have too much water in many respects and much of that water is of poor quality. The quality of that water is affected by salting or else polluted by other factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has emerged in the debate on Australia's population and migration into the future&mdash;and one of the considerations that has not been given a great deal of attention, of course&mdash;is how much water we have to support a population or an increased population. In fact, Australia's population may never exceed 50 million unless we do something dramatic about the conservation of water and the improvement of the quality of water which is available. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who preceded me, mentioned desalination and the impact that desalination could have in the future, provided, of course, that the technology can be further advanced and the cost of desalinising water can be brought down to a level at which people can afford and get a good quality water as a result of that desalination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scarcity of water throughout Australia has always been a problem and the distribution of that resource presents some massive problems for Australia. In fact, when I was a member of the Victorian State Parliament, the State Parliament set up a salinity committee which looked at a number of different areas. It brought down a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Salt of the Earth</EMPHASIS> and tried to identify some of the causes of salination of land and salination of water throughout this vast country. The report was extremely well done. One of the important things the committee recognised was that the salt affected areas&mdash;saltpans, salt marshes, saline streams and ground water&mdash;have been a feature of the environment in western and northern Victoria since long before European settlement. In fact, the salinity problems were here long before this country was settled, and settled in the numbers that we have come to understand now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had that problem for many years. The salinity committee of the Victorian Parliament made some excellent recommendations, many of which have been implemented. In fact, many of the areas of northern Victoria along the Murray irrigation area have adopted a lot of those recommendations and are looking at ways of arresting the ongoing salinity problem there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a rural area, of course, the Bendigo Federal electorate is dependent on water for both urban living and agricultural production. Even this year the grain growing in that area was affected either by too much rain in one burst or too little, in many instances, and, of course, that affected the grain growing production in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem which has been mentioned by my good friend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was the recent outbreaks of toxic blue-green algae. That problem, of course, has highlighted the importance and necessity of developing a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. The small township of Tooborac, not far from Bendigo, had its water supply halted and cut off because of algal bloom in the main reservoir. Water use was severely restricted, with none available for industry, agriculture or non-domestic use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the matter of ground water. Ground water, of course, is a valuable resource and one which is receiving much more attention now than it ever has in our past. The United Nations has been doing quite an amount of extensive research on this and has come up with a ground water policy. I quote briefly from the United Nations Charter on ground water management because I believe that it is extremely important. Recommendation I provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government should formulate and adopt a long-term policy to protect ground water from preventing pollution and over-use. This policy should be comprehensive and implemented at all appropriate levels. It should be consistent with other water-management policies and be duly taken into account in other sectorial policies.</PARA>
<PARA>That matter has also been addressed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS>, which is circulated throughout Victoria. It was highlighted in that paper as recently as 19 February, with an article headed `Out of sight, but water issues still bubble'. That article indicated that about 97 per cent of the world's fresh water resource is ground water and that most countries are dependent on its continuing purity. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation is so serious, the United Nations released an international ground water charter in 1989, the product of 10 years' research.</PARA>
<PARA>The important aspect from the point of view of agriculture is that the Victorian Farmers Federation water resources chairman, Mr John O'Brien, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the majority of Victoria's ground water users did not object to paying for ground water management, but disagreed with the way pricing was brought in.</PARA>
<PARA>However, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite a few of the ground water users are now aware of the management function of the Rural Water Commission and they see that there is a need to manage ground water. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point that I want to stress is that while ground is a very valuable resource, it has to be managed effectively and consistently so that the quality of that water is maintained. There are many areas throughout Australia where that quality of water is available; where it is a known resource. There obviously needs to be further examination and further exploration of the volume of water available. It is a valuable resource for Australia, particularly if we adhere to the quality and performance of that water and the ability for both urban and rural users to use that ground water in the effective production of crops which could be harvested in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also served on the Natural Resources and Environment Committee of the Victorian Parliament as chairman of its inquiry into water resources in south-west Victoria. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of that inquiry. That inquiry addressed the question of water resources on a catchment basis in that south-west area of Victoria. It addressed the question of how water could be best harvested and conserved and how the quality could be maintained for the servicing of regional cities such as Geelong. The Victorian Government has embarked on a State-wide program on that issue. It has investigated and is concerned with the better management and harvesting of water so that the quality can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the honourable member for Petrie on bringing this very important issue forward. There is a lot of research and information available on maintaining the quality of water for all Australians, and I know that in many respects Victoria has led the way in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of water conservation is the responsibility of all Australians. It should not just be the responsibility of the rural areas of Australia, because people in towns and cities also have a very important responsibility in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National problems relating to water resources in the future will relate to quality and not just quantity. We must work to ensure that future generations of Australians will be able to rely on the same quality of water as that enjoyed by the present population. As with other problems relating to the issue of sustainable development, we must come to realise that water is a finite resource. This point was driven home by the toxic blue-green algae blooms which occurred in the Darling River last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted in its report, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission's investigation of this problem found that the algae blooms were the result of serious discharges into inland rivers. During an average year effluent from towns surrounding the Murray-Darling Basin add 500 tonnes of elemental phosphorus and 2,790 tonnes of nitrogen to the river system. This urban water pollution is added to that which occurs from farming and grazing, and a toxic cocktail of nutrients is created which feeds the growth of the blue-green algae. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Murray-Darling Commission found there to be three interrelated sources of the toxic algae bloom. The first, as I have indicated, was the pollution of the waterways which fed the algae from several different sources. The second was the reduced flows in the rivers in the basin due to irrigation and domestic demand. It found that something must be done to reduce the high level of wastage associated with water use. Finally, it found that the degradation of the river ecosystem was a significant factor in the spread of the algae and had resulted in the destruction of creatures which had kept the algae in check in the past. The most important point to be learned from the blue-green algae bloom in the Murray-Darling Basin last year is that action must be taken to ensure that all levels of government do all in their power to ensure the maintenance of quality in our water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison with many other countries around the world, Australia is lucky in that it has, by international standards based on population, a plentiful supply of water. The answer to the problem of how to effectively manage our water resources is to use the resources we have more effectively. The manner in which this will be achieved is through a reduction of the level of wastage occurring at present in water usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout Australia the level of water consumption is increasing at a level far in excess of the level of population growth. An investigation last year into the level of water consumption in Australia's second largest city, Melbourne, found that the level of consumption was growing at four times the level of population growth. The city's water consumption is at present around 459,000 million litres a year and is growing at a rate of 2.2 per cent per year. If this rate of increase continues, permanent water restrictions may be needed to be introduced within 14 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the increase in population which is leading to this possibility; rather it is an increase in the rate of water use per head of population. Clearly, what is needed is a public education campaign to reduce the level of wastage. More dams, with their considerable economic and environmental costs, are not the answer. We must learn to manage the water resources already at our disposal more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has played an active role in the management of this most vital of natural resources. Its policies in this area are part of the Government's overall commitment to the goal of promoting ecologically sustainable development. The manner in which it has set out to achieve these goals has been through three primary mechanisms: the Australian Water Resources Commission, the AWRC; the Murray-Darling Basin ministerial initiative, the MDB; and financial assistance programs, particularly the Federal water resources assistance program, FWRAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Water Resources Council is made up of the Federal, State and Territory Ministers who have responsibility for the management of water resources and is chaired by the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The AWRC is at present involved in addressing a number of issues in water resources management, and is attempting to develop a shared policy framework and a national agenda in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has, in recent times, agreed that the issue of water quality should be taken into account when developing water management strategies, especially with regard to the issue of water quality management. In March of last year it issued a discussion paper which foreshadowed a framework through which water agencies could implement policies that are complementary to each other and the development of programs for water quality management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national water quality strategy is at present being developed by the AWRC to encourage a common approach to water quality management throughout Australia. It will do this through the use of guidelines which will be used in determining issues on a State by State basis. The strategy will recognise the interrelationship between environmental management and water resources management. The focus of the strategy will be to achieve sustainable use of Australia's water resources by ensuring that the quality of this resource is not only protected but also improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of guidelines will provide policy direction to future planning and action in this area. The need to raise the level of community awareness of water quality issues is important if the development and implementation of the strategy is to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling initiative is an initiative of the Federal, New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments. The initiative is designed to address environmental and water conservation and management issues in the basin. Out of this process have come two policy strategies. One has been a natural resource management strategy which has as its aim the provision of a strategic framework to achieve the sustainable use of natural resources within the region through planning and management programs, as well as joint community and government action. Part of this strategy is to improve the water quality of the Murray River and to preserve the natural environment of the basin and preserve sensitive ecosystems with respect to salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these two important policy initiatives in the area of water resource management, the Government is also involved in the funding of other water related initiatives through the Federal water resources assistance program, FWRAP. This program was introduced in 1984 to help achieve the Federal Government's water policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aims of the program are the efficient development, use and management of the nation's water resources. The way in which the program does this is through the provision of funding to the State and Territory governments for water resource development and management. Under the program the Federal Government provides financial assistance for works and measures that advance the Federal Government's water policy objectives. The assistance provided has taken the form of loans for projects in the form of business ventures, or grants for projects that have no business goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Federal Government has certainly played its part in ensuring that our water resources are more effectively managed. However, if a comprehensive national strategy for sustainable water use is to be developed, State government cooperation in the process is required. The Australian Constitution limits the role which the Federal Government can play in this area. Under the Constitution the States have primary responsibility for water resources management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the development of a coordinated national approach to take place on this issue, a great deal of cooperation between all levels of government must occur. As in other areas of environmental policy, it is necessary to develop a national strategy, as problems related to the degradation of our water resources do not begin and end in any one State. Take, for example, the Murray-Darling Basin, which covers territory under the control of three different State governments. The development of an effective management strategy for this area takes the cooperation of the three State governments concerned as well as the overall coordination by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What must be understood when discussing this issue is that the problem of how to effectively manage this resource is not unrelated to the problem of ecologically sustainable development. While no-one argues that we must pursue economic development if we are to progress as a community, there is a growing recognition within the community that environmental factors have often been undervalued when calculating our overall standard of living. There can be no question of the link between economic growth and a well managed environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water, as a resource, should be managed in such a way as to ensure the maintenance of its essential function within the ecosystem. A balance needs to be found so as to ensure that the economic, social and environmental issues related to development can be settled in a satisfactory manner. It is important that research be carried out into the quality and quantity of water needed to ensure that river and wetland ecosystems are maintained, to minimise a repeat of the type of toxic algae outbreak which occurred in the Darling River last year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)recognises the vital role of small business in our economy; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)condemns the Government for its poor economic and wages policies which have crippled the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the most tragic consequences of the policy paralysis which has surrounded this Government&mdash;and this is in spite of last night's spending spree&mdash;is its impact on the small business sector. The Government has been so caught up in its leadership struggle and in filling just one job that it has completely neglected the plight of the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, while small businesses have been grappling with the poor economy and struggling to survive, members of the Australian Labor Party have neglected the real issues to bicker amongst themselves. The result is clear. A lack of a comprehensive small business policy agenda, ongoing poor economic conditions, consistently low consumer confidence and growing unemployment have all led to the worst increase in small business bankruptcies on record. In fact, it would be fair to say that this has been the Government's only real achievement in respect of small business; that is, to bring about the worst decline of the sector and the greatest increase in the number of bankruptcies on record. The last financial year alone saw the number of business bankruptcies and personal bankruptcies grow by over 53 per cent. This is a huge increase in itself but is made more significant when one considers that it represents over 13,000 firms and individuals that have gone to the wall. That is 13,000 business proprietors who have lost their livelihood and families who have lost their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the number of small business bankruptcies is likely to get worse before it gets better. An analysis of the quarterly figures shows a rising trend. Bankruptcies increased by 52 per cent in the March quarter of 1991, by 55 per cent in the June quarter, and by a massive 72 per cent in the September quarter. Whilst the percentage increase fell slightly over the December quarter, continuing poor economic conditions, high unemployment and a very flat Christmas trading period all point to a further substantial increase in bankruptcies over the March and June quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government must be careful not to take these figures as representative of the true situation. Things out there are much worse. As the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) admitted, bankruptcy statistics do not reflect the many thousands of small business proprietors who do not reach the bankruptcy stage but who just close their doors and walk away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the decline of the small business sector, it is important to consider not only the number of bankruptcies but also the reasons given for them. According to the 1990-91 annual report required under the Bankruptcy Act, economic conditions were the main cause of business bankruptcies. But what have we heard from this Government about the crisis confronting the small business sector? Absolutely nothing. Indeed, it has shown a continuing reluctance to recognise the plight of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere has this been more evident than in the economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night. Sure, the Prime Minister gave us a lot of flowery words and painted a very rosy picture. But the crucial question is not so much what he hopes to achieve but whether he can deliver the goods. We should not forget that the Prime Minister is the same man who said, `There will not be a recession, we will not let there be a recession' and, `I knew we had to have a recession but I did not want to tell you'. He is the same man who said in February of 1990, `We will not have a scorched earth policy, we will not destroy business activity, and we will not destroy employment'. In November 1990 he said that the worst impact of the recession had passed. Then in December 1990 he said that the recovery would occur in the middle of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the one million Australians who are unemployed and the 13,000 bankrupt small business firms ever believe anything that the Prime Minister has to say? What about the thousands of small business people who accepted his word that there would be no recession and who borrowed money to invest in new plant and equipment, only to be caught out by the worst recession in 60 years? How can they ever trust this Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector is one which the Australian nation cannot do without. In fact, more than any other group, the small business sector has the potential to lead us out of this recession and to contribute most to employment growth. There are nearly 800,000 small businesses, comprising 96 per cent of all enterprises and employing just on 2.5 million people. In spite of this very significant contribution and its vital role in the provision of an infrastructure base, small business goes largely unnoticed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly we see very little consideration of the sector in the development and implementation of policy. This was illustrated again in the lead-up to the Government's economic statement last night. The Prime Minister made a big show of holding well publicised meetings with big business, trade unions and welfare groups. But where in the initial consultation process was small business represented? Only after some prodding&mdash;indeed, it was almost as an afterthought&mdash;did the Prime Minister even meet with the Small Business Coalition, much less hold meaningful discussions with the industry. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that last night's statement actually contained very little for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business costs, including fuel, payroll taxes, superannuation levy and the training levy, were not addressed. Similarly, the Government's increased funding to encourage small business to export will help only 700 of Australia's 800,000 small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. G.G.D. Scholes)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! I draw the attention of the honourable member for Forrest to the fact that he is entitled to make passing reference to events in the House but he is not entitled to debate a matter which is not before the House. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the Government was serious about enabling small business to maximise its contribution to Australia's economic recovery, it should have adopted measures contained in the coalition's Fightback package. Fightback offers small business tangible policies to meet its potential and to plan with certainty and confidence. No longer will small business be subject to wild fluctuations in interest rates and the damaging boom and bust cycles that confront industry today. The coalition will also reform the tax system to reward small business people for hard work and effort, to lower their costs and to enhance their competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given our commitment to make business more competitive, the coalition will abolish $20 billion worth of taxes on business, including the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, petrol excise, customs duties and the training levy. In doing this, we will reduce business costs and make small business both domestically and internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will remove taxes from exports. The coalition's goods and services tax will be zero rated on exports and we will also be providing rebate on the GST on business inputs. In fact, all of the GST on inputs to business, whether for exports or domestic consumption and including raw materials, motor vehicles and fuel, et cetera, will be rebatable. This is fundamental to the coalition's commitment to reduce small business costs. It is interesting to note that this is one point that the Labor Party blatantly misrepresents or through sheer stupidity fails to recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small firms will also gain substantial cash flow benefits. They will have the use of the GST collective on sales from the time of collection up to the time of remittance for business and trading purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administration of the GST will also be relatively simple and, contrary to the Government's scare campaign, will not increase the administrative burden nor the administrative costs of small business. Small business will not have to introduce new systems to accommodate the GST, nor will it have to complete reams of paperwork. Indeed, calculations of the GST will utilise existing accounting records and remittances will involve the completion of just one form. Finally, small business will not have to issue sales receipts beyond those already issued by business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Labor Party has failed to comprehend these facts or else it is blatantly distorting them. Either way, it is a measure of its desperation that it has to resort to such blatant and immature scare tactics. The coalition will also substantially reduce income tax rates and provide comprehensive measures which give consumers more disposable income, thereby boosting demand and production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant component of our tax reform program is the introduction of a capital gains tax roll-over. This is one area that the Government got wrong last night. It failed to recognise that the roll-over would encourage the growth and expansion of small business as well as the generation of a significant number of employment opportunities. Indeed, the Government's half-hearted measures announced last night fell well short of the comprehensive reforms for the capital gains tax outlined in the coalition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of the industrial relations system is also essential. Award wage rises, compulsory superannuation and the training levy all have a significant and additional cost impact on small business without providing any real benefits. Small businesses are forced to pay the wage increases negotiated by the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission but, in a lot of cases, do not realise any offsetting productivity benefits. The coalition is committed to changing this by deregulating the labour market to enable employers and employees to negotiate their own enterprise agreements. The benefit to employers will be through better productivity and lower costs, while employees will gain because of a potentially higher take-home pay, more flexible conditions of employment and better working conditions and a better working environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses have long supported this policy and have lobbied Government for similar measures. But because the Government is tied to the trade union movement, it cannot deliver on this important area of reform. An accelerated program of reform in the transport system, on the waterfront, an education system targeted more towards the changing needs of our society, a national savings strategy and a better health care system are other features of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sweeping nature of the coalition's proposals, the very substantial benefits that will accrue to small business, are a clear indication of the Coalition's commitment to that sector&mdash;a commitment which has not been demonstrated by this Government so far. The bottom line is that, under a coalition government, small business will be free to reach its full potential and once again take its rightful place as a significant contributor to employment and to our national wealth and prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has just resumed his seat and has endeavoured to use this debate to score a few political points. But if one looks at the history of small business in this nation and the record of this Government in relation to small business, then one can only say his criticisms are unwarranted and they are politically motivated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the honourable member did not bother to read the economic statement from last night and also did not bother to ask his researchers or take the time himself to go back and see just what this Government has been doing in the area of small business over recent years. Had he bothered to read the Beddall report, he would not be standing up in this chamber making such outlandish statements. If he had bothered to see what has taken place in recent times through the structures that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) has brought forward, he would also not be making these criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government initiated the first inquiry ever into small business. One recalls that when the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was the Minister for Science and Small Business he initiated this approach. It was taken up by a committee headed by the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. After two years the Beddall report was brought down. I would say that it was hailed by people right across the nation, right across the political spectrum. It was supported by people of all political persuasions. It was not something supported only by the ACTU; it was supported by the chambers of commerce, by the CAI, and by the small business associations, because they saw that for the first time a committee of this Parliament had got to the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee brought down 66 recommendations, 57 of which have been acted upon or are in train. That leaves only nine that have not been dealt with, yet the honourable member for Forrest has the audacity to stand up here and say that this Government does not recognise the importance of small business in our economy. I point out that this was the first inquiry. In spite of the fact that we have across from us an Opposition which is supposed to be a supporter and promoter of small business in the community, it was this Labor Government that acted on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest talked about the problems of small business; I acknowledge those. I acknowledge that there have been real difficulties for small business in recent years, but let us not forget the part played by the banks in all this. We have seen official interest rates drop something like 10 points in the last 20 months, yet small business in my area still faces overdraft rates of 18 per cent. The banks have been generous in that they have dropped rates down to 16 per cent. The official rate is 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a real dilemma for small business because not only have they been locked into high interest rates, they have also not been able to borrow further. Those who have tried to borrow to extend their overdraft have been told, `No, you can take part in overdraft and part in a cocktail loan'. I have said in this House before&mdash;and I restate it because it happened again recently&mdash;that a small business person had to take part of his need</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the honourable member for Fadden has acknowledged this because he has a special knowledge of small business and I acknowledge his expertise in this field. It is ridiculous that people cannot go out and borrow in overdraft terms, but must take so much at 16 per cent on overdraft and the rest at 23 per cent on Bankcard. That has been very much the approach. There have also been some difficulties when banks have refused to lend for motels, hotels and small businesses. They have had amazing restrictions, ridiculous restrictions, saying that people have not had expertise in the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a case of a fellow buying into a fruit shop. He was even including in his business administration for the next six months, one of the owners, the previous owners, who was going to work for him for six months, yet the bank knocked back the loan because they said he himself did not have experience in that business. In a fruit shop! Quite amazing. The same has been true in so many other industries where the banks have taken a hardline view because of the mistakes they made in previous years in lending practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But setting that aside, let us come back to what this Government has done. If one looks at this, one particularly must give credit to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs. This man, because of his knowledge of small business, his expertise and experience in it, his commitment to it and his understanding of its vitality and its potential to turn this country around, has done everything required of him. Most importantly he has listened. He was the first to sit down and talk to small business. He was the first to set up a small business coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recall what the record shows: 35 business associations representing all sections of the economy&mdash;the Council of Small Business Associations of Australia, the Australian Small Business Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the CAI, the Chamber of Manufactures, the MTIA, the MTAA, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, including the service station people, and the real estate institutes through the REIA&mdash;have sat down in consultation and discussion and brought forward some major recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been this Government through that Minister that inquired into the franchise problems in that industry. It is this Government that carried out this inquiry and brought together a task force. It did not just talk about it; it came up with the goods. Members who took the opportunity to read the report, which was released in December last year, would know that it is revolutionary. It is the sort of report we needed. It is a comprehensive policy, not to regulate the franchise industry but to allow self-regulation. Some control is kept by using the banking industry as an instrument to ensure that those that do not play the game in franchising are not going to be able to get the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see this as a very, very important and positive approach. Now it has got to go to the States; it will come about only with the support of State Ministers. But I am sure, I am confident, that what the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs set out here with the support of private enterprise will be achieved. He has been able to sit down with franchisers and franchisees of the legal and banking industry and come up with what is certainly a proposal and policy that will be a catalyst to vitality and growth in the franchising industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also that Minister, with the backing of other members on this side of the House&mdash;and, I might say, also of some Labor senators, Democrats and others in the Senate&mdash;who changed the Trade Practices Act to expand the effective impact of section 52A on unconscionable conduct. Consumers have had protection under section 52A of the Trade Practices Act, but small business has not. It has been this Government&mdash;the previous Prime Minister, backed by the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and Cabinet&mdash;that has moved to expand section 52A. It has been the same Government that has ensured that there have now been major changes coming out of the deliberations that took place on 6 February. Those small business leaders who met with the Prime Minister put forward a number of propositions. Yet the honourable member for Forrest says nothing is taking place in the economic statement. If only he would read it, if only he would go to the issues of capital gains, he would note that the exemptions on goodwill have been increased from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>

It will give them that capital mobility; it will allow them to move into other businesses&mdash;not expand their own, but to sell and buy into something else knowing full well that they have that capital underpinning because they will not be paying capital gains tax on it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just amazes me that the honourable member has not bothered to read that.

It is only for two months, it is only short term, but it acknowledges the problems that small business has been suffering in that recession. It is necessary short term relief that this Government is giving now; similarly with the new debt write-off provisions and debt for equity swap opportunities for the banking industry. Small business has been arguing for years that there ought to be greater incentive to banks to write off debts without winding up and destroying a business. This Government now says there shall be a tax benefit to those banks that wipe off bad debts. There is also now going to be tax recognition of debt for equity swaps. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to another issue because the honourable member for Forrest raised the Opposition's perceived advantages of the GST. He ought to talk again to small business, because what the GST means is a burden on small business. Small business would become agencies for the Australian Taxation Office; it would be legally responsible for the collection of that tax; it would mean that it would have higher operating costs; it would have to purchase new equipment for outlays and for cash registers. One fellow says he will have to employ a person for at least eight hours a week just to meet the cost and the need to determine what tax has to be paid and what has been collected previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the honourable member not talk to the tourist industry, the spare parts industry, the transport industry, the hairdressing industry and the petroleum industry?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the comments of people in the first line, if you like, which indicate whether businesses are going to succeed or not. What they are saying to us is that business cannot pay its rent. Business cannot pay its rent because of what has been occurring over the last few years under this Government with its policy of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the comments of the honourable member for Capricornia who said that interest rates have been high and they have been locked in at those high rates. Who does he think got them to that position? Interest rate policy is the only mechanism the Government knew to use to try to look after the economy in this country. The real problem with this Government is that what it wants to do is come out and say how wonderful things are on the surface but when we get out and talk to the individual people in the street it is a totally different picture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are out of touch as the member for Forrest and as the shadow Minister says. Now in contrast to that, what we are doing within the coalition with the Fightback package is giving people opportunities. We are going to cut away the costs that are going to make the difference between businesses being able to succeed and not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payroll tax, $5.8 billion a  year, is a major impost on business. By cutting that away we will be able to provide people with a reduction in cost. In fact, if one looks at tax levels overall, one will see that we will be cutting in excess of $20 billion out of the cost to business. That means that business will be able to compete with overseas competitors. It is no good throwing money against the wall and saying, `Here is the opportunity for jobs to be created'. The fact is that the Government will have to continue to throw money against the wall because they are part time jobs the Government is creating. The life span of these jobs will be two or three years. They will not be available on a long term basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do and what we must do if this country is to get back on its feet is to offer full time opportunities. We have to address the area of small business. Ninety-six per cent of the businesses in this country are small businesses. We have to give them the opportunity to compete. That is not something the Government has addressed. It is all very well to say, `We are going to provide a few jobs here and we are going to provide a few jobs there through throwing money at the wall'. We must give businesses the incentive to continue and give them the opportunity to see a light at the end of the tunnel. In recent years that light has been very dim indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the shadow Minister for small business, the honourable member for Forrest, is very correct with the motion he has moved with respect to this Government's performance, or lack of performance, in the area of small business. The Government should look at the real issues of businesses on the ground and talk to the people who have mortgaged their houses and put all of their savings into a business that they had hoped they could keep for their family as an ongoing concern, only to find themselves being put into the situation of bankruptcy through no fault of their own. I stress that point&mdash;through no fault of their own but through the handling of the economy by this Government. I believe that we as a coalition must stand up to address those issues and do something for those people. That is what the Fightback package does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the comment earlier that in fact we are not addressing small business issues. The fact of the matter is that our package will give the opportunity for jobs to be created in small businesses. I take the point that was made that there will be businesses that will not get the benefit of the payroll tax initiative directly. They will get it indirectly because jobs will be created within the system. People will be able to get jobs and buy goods once again. That has not been happening. We have had to readdress this whole direction and the whole recipe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government suggests that its policies will do anything in the interests of small business then all I can suggest is that Government members come and talk to people in my electorate. They have refused so far. I am not looking for political gain out of this. I want them to come and listen to the problems that I face on the ground in one of the largest small manufacturing electorates in the country. When they have heard those comments I would ask them to think again about the rhetoric that they produce in this place to the effect that small business is looking rosy. I can assure them that in the electorate of Isaacs, in many of the neighbouring electorates and, I would suggest, around the country that  is just not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a typical Liberal speech with a lot of talk about what is happening in the economy and very little talk about what the Liberals would do to fix it. It is salutary to recognise that small business does thrive when the economy is thriving&mdash;there is no doubt about that. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said the other day, when we became the Government the size of our economy, as measured by the GDP, was $171 billion. Last year it grew to $405 billion&mdash;a rapid growth, whichever way you measure it. That rapid growth in the economy was matched by a rapid growth in small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) spoke about bankruptcies. He made the comparison with the Fraser years and talked about using statistics. It is obvious that there were fewer small businesses in the Fraser years. There are a lot more small businesses now. It might be a good exercise to have a look at the ratio of businesses that are failing now compared to the ratio of businesses that failed during the Fraser years. I think the honourable member would find that there was not much difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a pamphlet from the Sydney Business and Technology Centre which has a scheme for helping small business. It says that 85 per cent of small businesses succeed when they start in a business incubator&mdash;that is what the Business and Technology Centre is promoting&mdash;and that 80 per cent fail when they do not. I know we should take what we read in advertising with a grain of salt, but in the pamphlet it says that Australia has one of the worst failure rates for small businesses in the world. What the people at the Business and Technology Centre are saying is that the main reason for small business failure is lack of management technique and lack of management know-how. So, for whatever reason a small business fails, it will fail whether times are good or times are bad. It is just that more of them fail when times are bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Isaacs also talked about the Fightback package&mdash;quickly becoming the`Dieback' package. I listened very intently, but the only thing he mentioned in the whole speech was the abolition of payroll tax. The simple fact is that small business does not pay payroll tax&mdash;it is big business that pays payroll tax. So we should not look for any advantage for small business in the Fightback package because there is none. In actual fact, the Fightback package has within it the one element which will send more small businesses broke&mdash;the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article by Mr John Morine in the magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Small Business and Investing. </EMPHASIS>The article is based on the New Zealand experience of the impact of GST on small business. Mr Morine is a chartered accountant who has worked with the GST in New Zealand. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sunday at the beach with the family will be a thing of the past, as you spend your `leisure' time grappling with GST returns and trying to unscramble your accounting records from taxation complications you do not understand.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus the experience in the country next to us which brought in a goods and services tax has been that small business failures have shot up remarkably. In the same article, Mr Morine refers to the tax-take in New Zealand and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a tax-take to the Government of $5 billion per annum, of which $1.25 billion or 25 per cent is lost in meeting the cost to the business sector of complying with the GST legislation and accounting for tax,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an estimated 20 per cent dissipation of time and resources for small business proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA>In weighing up the Fightback package and its impact on small business, we should not talk about payroll tax, because in actual fact the abolition of payroll tax is a disadvantage to small business. Let me explain why. If I were a retailer with a small family business retailing anything at all&mdash;shoes, curtains or any other household goods&mdash;competing against a firm such as Myers which does pay payroll tax, because my small business does not pay payroll tax, if the Opposition were to take off the payroll tax, that would give the advantage to Myers. Thus that would advantage big firms over small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned before in reference to the article by Mr Morine, a firm such as Myers has the accounting capacity to accommodate a GST, but the small businessman does not. The small businessman runs his own business and he must make the adjustment. He must get the accounting records to have a look at the goods coming into his business and the value he has to add to them. He has to subtract the GST from what he bought and he has to add on the GST to what he sells. Then he has to remit that to the taxation department on a monthly basis. The amount of book work involved in this is going to be horrendous for small business. Mr Morine, based on his experience, has this advice to offer to small businessmen in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in this chamber the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) referred to a Canadian report which said much the same thing. One would think that any political party or any politician worth his salt might actually go in and do a little bit of research about what impact the Fightback package, or the `Dieback' package, has on small business. When we look at New Zealand and Canada, two countries which have recently introduced the GST, we see that the impact on small business has been horrendous in both cases. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The fact is that a small business at the present time only fills in one tax return when it pays its company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not hear the honourable member for Isaacs mention in his speech that under the Fightback package company tax is going from 39c to 42c. That is another little thing in the Fightback package which I am sure small business will appreciate. The only form they fill out is when they pay their company tax at the end of the year. But have a look at what they are going to do now&mdash;they will have to get a tax collector's number, a big badge from the Taxation Office saying, `I am tax collector number whatever'. It is going to run into six or seven digits, and you can see them wearing it in their shops as official tax collectors for the Tax Office. It is going to cost small businesses; it is going to cost them time and it is going to cost them money. But not only that, when we sit down and look at the goods and services delivered by small business, they are by and large the goods that do not carry any tax now. When we go down to get a haircut there is no tax on that, but under Fightback it will be 15 per cent. What do honourable members think that is going to do to demand for the goods and services that small business provides? Do they think putting 15 per cent on top will actually increase demand or suppress it? It is a multiple choice question and I will leave them to mull over it. However, my instincts are that putting 15 per cent on those goods and services supplied by small business will actually cause demand to drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the next speaker can answer this: will demand go up with a 15 per cent tax on goods and services or will it go down? I cannot for the life of me see why this 15 per cent is a good thing for small business. I cannot see why a goods and services tax as announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> will help small business people when they are going to spend their weekends, as Mr Morine says, not down at the beach with their families but grappling with GST returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that good for small business? I cannot see it, but I am always open to persuasion. I have yet to hear it. I listened intently to the speech from the honourable member for Isaacs. He talked a lot about incentive&mdash;I thought `incentivation' might pop out&mdash;the light at the end of the tunnel, all of this good stuff, all of these heroic statements, all the motherhood statements, but the only thing he mentioned was the abolition of payroll tax and, as I pointed out, that is going to be a disadvantage to small business when it competes with big business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also talked about competing overseas. Let me give you the tip: most small business does not compete overseas. Some do, and for those we will be making sure that, through the export access program, which we boosted last night from $4m to $12m, they will get the assistance they need. But most small businesses compete within Australia; they compete amongst each other. There is nobody from overseas small businesses competing with ours. So, despite that talk about overseas competition, it is not a major factor. It is a factor but only a very minor one, and we addressed that last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me say this: the Fightback package is a disaster for small business. It will not only suppress demand but it will also mean that small business will spend more of its time in complying with tax requirements, furnishing tax records to the Taxation Office <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>and in the end it will mean that more small businesses will hit the fence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this private member's motion introduced by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). Next December is the twentieth anniversary of the election of the Whitlam Government and the beginning of a steady decline in the fortunes of this nation and the morale of its people. Indeed, the record of the past 20 years speaks for itself. There is a record of incompetence and mismanagement, of social engineering and of systematic plundering of the nation's accumulated wealth, particularly small business wealth. It is the industrious middle class and its productive sector which have been decimated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When E.G. Whitlam narrowly won the 1972 election, Australia's foreign debt was barely a ripple on the radar and the nation enjoyed some status as a member of the most prosperous nations club. Our small businesses were also prosperous. Today, Australia's circumstances are different. The status has dramatically changed. The level of foreign indebtedness has reached alarming proportions and the debt servicing burden is now absorbing a large fraction of our nation's savings, thus cutting into the nation's future growth potential&mdash;growth that can be generated by small business. The net cost of interest service is now approximately 20 per cent of export income, compared with 17 per cent in 1988-89 and less than 5 per cent in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is rapidly approaching the danger zone of 25 per cent and is highly exposed to the effects of a downturn in the world economy, especially a fall in commodity prices. Many small businesses are well above the 20 per cent danger zone. It costs them more than 25 per cent of their income to service their debt. At the same time we have, of course, lost our position in the most prosperous nations club and now we barely make the second eleven. The tragedy of more than a million unemployed and a depression we had to have is the culmination of 20 years of business bashing&mdash;not BHP bashing, but small business bashing. A loony left wing and anti-business policies emanating from Canberra and the Swanston Street soviet have caused this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to describe to the House how businesses, particularly small businesses, have been decimated by Government policy. In 1973 the Whitlam Government abruptly reduced the tariff protection on clothing and footwear by some 25 per cent. This was a sudden change without reference to industry. Since 1973 tariff policies have been totally inconsistent. While there are undoubtedly strong arguments for tariff reduction in Australia, business has simply become the Government's whipping boy. Not only has it become ruthlessly exploited as a source of revenue, but also it is consistently assaulted by ridiculous bureaucratic changes and interference. A parts supplier to the car industry in my electorate of Dunkley has finally had enough and virtually quit Australia&mdash;it has quit production, in particular. Initially it believed it could cope with the Button car plan and it was able to cope with many changes. However, it finally came to the conclusion that it felt it was not wanted. The cost has been in jobs&mdash;jobs for ordinary Australians whose opportunities have been exported overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concentrating on the last 20 years and it has taken that long for industry, particularly small business, to reach its present parlous state. No amount of snake oil rhetoric and vote buying by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can change this. Business generally, and small business in particular, is, I believe, far weaker now than it has been since the disaster of the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will explain why. In the Depression of the 1930s businesses did not have to pay termination redundancy payments. They did not have to pay long service leave. Employees who were retrenched in the 1930s did not get these payments. The unions would say this is progress; however, I question the definition of progress. In recent decades companies have been weakened enormously, with the resulting unemployment that now afflicts well over a million Australians. I realise that it is not the employees' fault that they were retrenched; it certainly was not the employer's fault. The blame must be laid at the feet of Australia's protected army of meddling bureaucrats and the social engineering busybodies whose loathing of business has become so evident in government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are businesses in my electorate of Dunkley which are unable to retrench any more employees. They simply cannot afford it; there is no money left. The best employees, left until last, will not get their entitlements. The businesses will not survive; they will go bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When payments such as termination redundancies became part of the award system they were little more than an enormous back pay costing billions of dollars&mdash;probably hundreds of billions of dollars in todeb's terms. The absolute tragedy is that our youth will continue to suffer. The 35 per cent youth unemployment is a catastrophe that will haunt the nation for a full generation at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Government has admitted that businesses will not commence employing people in the short term. They will seek greater efficiencies from those already employed. Why should a small business operator employ additional people? Through no fault of the business person, he could run into another recession and have to pay out far more huge payments on redundancies and terminations. One cannot even put money aside to cover these payments. The Taxation Office will take 40 per cent. So if a person is entitled to a $5,000 redundancy package, which is not uncommon, the business person either has to find the money in depressed conditions or put aside $7,000 in good times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wealth of this country and the prosperity of small business that have taken so long to achieve are in great danger of being squandered by the spoiled baby boomers whose demands have so weakened our wealth creating capacity. They pour scorn on the achievements of the past and the struggles of our forAlears to create a prosperous and civilised society in what was very often a hostile environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great wealth of our mining and pastoral industries and the opportunities created in business and industry have underpinned much that we value in Australia. However, very few seem to realise that wealth creation is a difficult and risky business. It can only be created in a very small number of ways: growing it, mining it and manufacturing it. Only these products can be traded and exchanged for wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A century after the Great Depression of the 1890s, Australia is again in a bad way. The miners, mainly large businesses, are expanding overseas, as they appear to have little faith in the future of this country. Manufacturers, mainly small businesses, are not in a position to compete with imports, despite what the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) just said. Small business does have to compete with imported products. It is a huge factor when you set up a small business. No amount of taking the so-called hard decisions will change the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder how many of these problems were faced by businesses trying to survive in the Depression of the 1930s. Not many I suggest. Indeed, how very many small businesses can grow in Australia is a mystery to me. The tax regime makes it impossible for a small business to generate its own capital. It is forced into debt. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) mentioned that small business does not collect payroll tax. Most payroll tax applies above 12 personnel in Australia, so most small businesses do collect payroll tax. The honourable member for Canning got it wrong. A small business person in Australia faces personal income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, provisional tax, sales tax, payroll tax, withholding tax, prescribed payments, import duties, Customs compilation charges, registration fees, licence fees, stamp duties, land tax, Federal tax on&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the first part of this motion, which says that we should recognise the vital role of small business in our economy. Who would not support this proposition? The small business sector of our economy is vital to the well-being of this nation and I recognise that immediately. I support this proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sector contains over 800,000 businesses that employ well over two million Australians. They are a source of innovation in terms of product and work practices and also in terms of introducing many of our great entrepreneurs to the marketplace and enabling them to make a start in the business world. Who would not support such a sector? It is, however, a very varied sector which ranges from the local deli and supermarket and the local newsagent to service providers such as plumbers, electricians and veterinarians. It also includes enterprises&mdash;such as I was proud to be a member of before I entered this place&mdash;for high technology, innovative product design, through which Australian industry can be upgraded and access to production of new technologies made available to Australian industry. It is, in other words, a very varied sector that we lump together merely because of the size of the enterprises: they are called small, or often small-medium, enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the small business sector, it is quite typical for many firms to be forming and other firms to be moving out of business or going bankrupt. That is the normal order of a market economy such as we are members of. As new businesses form, so old businesses tend to go out. As the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) pointed out, because the small business sector has been larger during the 1980s and early 1990s, there have been more businesses coming in and more going out in the form of bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the proposition I find more difficult to support, so I will oppose it. It seeks to condemn the Government for its poor economic and wages policy which has crippled the small business sector. What can a government do that would most help this very diverse but extensive small business sector? The most important thing a government can do for this sector is to produce aggregate growth of the economy and the market in which the small business sector operates. If we look at the record of this Government during its nine years, there has been a very substantial growth of the Australian economy, from an aggregate of about $170 billion to an aggregate of about $405 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This figure represents a growth rate of the economy of almost double that achieved during a similar period of the coalition Government. It represents a growth rate of just above 4 per cent per annum during those nine years and a growth in jobs of 1.5 million, a growth rate of 23 per cent. That contrasts with a growth rate in jobs during the previous Government's term of just over 300,000, or 5 to 6 per cent. During the term of this Government, we have seen the most substantial fillip that can be given to the small business sector, that is, a growth of the aggregate economy and the market within which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we have seen efforts to alleviate problems which small business in the past has faced, as is well known to this House. Many small business people fail because they feel they lack the skills to run and operate a business. During the period of this Government we have increased very substantially training programs in business skills in the school system, the universities&mdash;where they have been designated an area of national priority&mdash;and in the TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the provision of labour to small business has been given attention. The unit costs of labour have been reduced, the number of industrial actions or strikes by labour has been reduced, and workplace reforms have ensured greater flexibility in the operation of our work force in small business places. We have ensured that our skill training programs have been locally designed in order to meet local enterprise skill needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in this respect that Skillshare is a local job market training program that the Opposition promised at the 1990 election to abolish, but I see that now it may well have changed its mind for the next election. I welcome this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very early in the life of the Government we deregulated the finance sector with a view to making finance more readily available to small-medium business enterprises. It is true that all these reforms have witnessed some difficulty over the last 18 months with the onset of a recession which we all regret, which has been worldwide, and which would have been enormously difficult to avoid totally even with 100 per cent hindsight. This has led, as is typical of the trade cycle, to an increase in bankruptcies and to a reduction in the percentage of businesses being formed. Nonetheless, this recession will come to an end and small business will go into a boom economy once more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last two years we have paid great attention to the formation of a specific small business reform program based on the Beddall report, which was brought down in January 1990. By way of reaffirming the commitment of this Government to small and medium enterprises, I draw the House's attention not only to the extensive reform program suggested by the Beddall report but also to the progress that has been made in implementing that report which by now has been almost 87 per cent implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the arrangements that have been put in place for small business in particular as a result of this specifically targeted small business reform program? First of all, improved consultative arrangements have been implemented with respect to the national small business forums and with respect to the national executive of small business agencies, and it has led to the creation of a Small Business Coalition which is therefore capable of consulting with government on the same basis as does the trade union movement or large businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dialogue which led up to last night's statement we note that on 6 February the Small Business Coalition met with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in order to have its input into the 26 February statement and the results are there for all to see. We have improved the export access program in order to improve access to export markets for small business. Taxation reform has already been introduced with a view to streamlining tax administration and reducing compliance costs for small business. The operation of the market has been improved by extending section 52A of the Trade Practices Act to include commercial transactions, subject to the Cooney committee report, which was tabled in December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The franchising task force has already been referred to and retail and commercial tenancies are also under scrutiny for reform. The regulatory framework has also been changed with the federal paperwork reduction strategy. Finally, we have under review two inquiries, one from the Industry Commission and one from the Martin inquiry to improve access to finance for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the management and business skills training strategy. This has been extended and when the now Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, he gave a commitment to extend the training of skills formation for business to the small business forum, and that will be implemented. A number of other provisions have been instituted with a view to improving the condition of small business and its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now in contrast to this I note the effects of the introduction of a GST package which the Opposition has designated Fightback. What would be the impact of this on small business? Two things need to be noticed. First of all, the goods and services tax of the type being proposed by the coalition would be a fully value added tax, which would be collected at every stage of production and distribution and processed for all goods and services. That would create a whole new load of paperwork for small business whether they are manufacturers, wholesalers, service businesses or retailers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently about 70,000 wholesale sales tax collection points in Australia. Under the GST proposal there would 850,000. I note that the honourable member for Canning referred to a New Zealand study of the effects of the GST published by John Morine in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Small Business and Investing</EMPHASIS> journal. I would like to quote a Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The GST and National Tax Tragedy</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of a survey of small businesses indicated that 70.6 per cent of respondents found that the GST had a negative impact of their business with 8 per cent believing the impact to be positive, while 14 per cent found no impact. The results clearly illustrate the regressive effects of taxes like the GST as smallest firms had the most problems with the tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Now in recognition of this, last night's statement introduced a range of new taxation measures and fiscal policy initiatives designed to improve the lot of small business. I will refer to them briefly. There is a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small businesses; a two-month extension of the 1991-92 company tax payments; a tripling of funding support to $12m for assisting small enterprises to get into export markets; the introduction of pooled development funds; changes to banking regulations to allow banks to write off loans to troubled businesses trying to trade their way out, and a commitment to banks to expand their lending. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall that the Australian Government was represented at the World Summit for Children in 1990 and that on behalf of the then Prime Minister of this country, Mr Hawke, several promises were made regarding the needs of the world's children. I might say that Australia was one of the few countries that were not formally represented at that conference by its Prime Minister but we were represented somewhat belatedly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. The promises that were made were to cut down all preventable child deaths by the year 2000; to cut maternal death rates by half by the year 2000; to reduce severe and moderate malnutrition among children by one half of the 1990 level; that a goal be set for the provision of clear water and sanitation for all families; that basic education be available to all and at least 80 per cent of all children complete primary education; that education be provided for at least half of the uneducated and illiterate adults, especially women; and that children be provided with protection in situations of armed conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should note that, to give effect to these promises, Australia promised that an interdepartmental committee to develop a plan to effect these aims by the end of 1991 would be put in place. I must say that I very much regret, and it is part of the terms of the motion, that, with less than two months to go in 1991, there had been no announcement from the Government regarding the honouring of this commitment. I should say, however, that finally the Government did establish an interdepartmental committee on 19 December, very much at the end of the year and three weeks after this notice of motion was given by me. I suspect that it was not a coincidence. No doubt the Government was intending to put in place these matters in a timely fashion, but it was some three weeks after this notice was given. It is extraordinary that the Government has taken a year to put in place the first steps towards development of a national plan of action which was supposed to have been completed by the year 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the World Summit, 71 world leaders gathered and made a commitment to support the rights of children and to give every child a better future. The impetus for such a gathering came from some most alarming statistics which brought home rather forcefully the magnitude of the problems confronting the children of the world. Nearly 15 million children under five die each year; half a million mothers die annually as a result of pregnancy or childbirth; some 40 per cent of children under five in the developing world suffer from malnutrition; only half the children in the developing world have access to clean water for drinking purposes, and fewer have access to sanitary waste disposal facilities. Nearly 100 million children of primary school age are not taking part in any education programs; about 50 per cent of adult women and 30 per cent of all adult men are illiterate and over 100 million children are suffering as a result of war and are victims of exploitation and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10-point plan of action aims to reduce many of these problems by the end of the decade. It is an ambitious undertaking for any nation and it is aimed primarily at alleviating child mortality and suffering, though its scope is much wider. Australia committed itself to the plan of action, which sets out the following 10-point program to protect the rights of children and to improve their lives. The list is quite comprehensive. I could in fact give the first sentence of each one but if it is in order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a table setting out the 10 points, which I would seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask honourable members to look at those points. They will see that we have set ourselves a formidable task. No-one would argue that such a task ought not have first priority in the business of government. After all, we are speaking of no lesser objective than the health, education, safety and long term well-being of the planet's most precious assets, our children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that the additional annual cost of programs to prevent 50 million child deaths in the 1990s will reach approximately $2.5 billion by the end of the decade. No-one would argue that the objectives of the plan are not worth this price. No-one, for example, could in all conscience argue that the cost of a day's weapons production has an equal value to the lives of 50 million children at the same cost. The majority of these children will die from preventable diseases: diarrhoea, measles, tetanus in new-born babies, and acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The technology to prevent these diseases is at hand: oral rehydration for diarrhoea, antibiotics to stem the effects of pneumonia, and immunisation against measles and tetanus, as well as other diseases that can be wiped out, including polio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of oral rehydration therapy salts is only US10c and yet, of 11,000 children who die daily from diarrhoea, 7,000 succumb to dehydration which the oral rehydration therapy can prevent. Another 7,000 die from acute respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia. The cure is about $US1 for a course of antibiotics. Even though these two therapies have been available for decades, about 100 million have died from diarrhoeal dehydration and acute respiratory infections during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts, in principle, the provisions of the plan and believes it is incumbent upon all of us to do what we can to ensure that the children of the world receive a better future. We also recognise that Australia may have some difficulty in achieving the targets implicit for Australia in the plan of action. The Council for Overseas Aid has calculated that Australia has made a commitment to spend an additional $110m per year on projects to benefit children. Clearly, there will have to be a readjustment of priorities in budgetary terms to make this target attainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also have to review all of its programs involving children. Most especially, this should involve a review of government responsibilities to the children of Australia. In 1989 Brian Burdekin, the Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been an almost complete failure to satisfactorily address the needs of our children, and many of these kids . . . are living in the most appalling conditions and in some cases, tragically, are literally dying . . . Children (are) reduced to hopelessness and to death from diseases which could have been avoided by effective programs and timely responses.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in Australia there are over half a million children living in poverty, and it was estimated in the Burdekin report that there are as many as 75,000 homeless youths. Two years after the Burdekin report, child poverty and homelessness are worse than ever. Also, while the provision of basic health services, such as clean drinking water, would normally have been seen as a priority only for a developing country, many Aboriginal children live in circumstances without access to basic services. Child mortality rates in the Aboriginal communities are significantly above the Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The causes of the problems the plan of action is designed to address are varied and complex. Many countries around the world are enduring the pains of economic recession and structural adjustment, and so poverty and all its consequences will be on the increase. To halt this trend, the entire web of interlocking causes must be addressed. It is incumbent upon all of us to address these causes; not only to address the present crisis but to prevent the cycle of poverty. We are very much a part of this. The expense is not only financial. The greater expense is in political will, time and commitment. Putting forward this effort, time and commitment involves a long term investment in the future of our children. </PARA>

The vulnerability and special needs of children in developing countries and in particular the least developed ones deserve priority, but growth and development need promotion in all states through national action and international cooperation. That calls for transfers of appropriate additional resources to developing countries as well as improved terms of trade, further trade liberalisation and measures for debt relief, and also implies structural adjustments that promote world economic growth, particularly in developing countries, while ensuring the well-being of the most vulnerable sectors of the population, in particular, the children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to address the concerns of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) on behalf of the Government and to recognise the involvement and concern of that member in human rights issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Summit for Children, as he has said, was held in December 1990 under the auspices of the United Nations and it produced two key documents: the world declaration on the survival, protection and development of children, and a plan of action to give effect to the world declaration. The declaration and the plan of action, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have heard, cover areas such as child and maternal health, food and nutrition, education, support for children in difficult circumstances and international aid programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Difficult circumstances' becomes a euphemism in the face of the reality of family life in many parts of the world. We speak a lot of how we support family life and the family structure. For many people the destruction of family life will result from the destruction of members one by one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNICEF reports that in 1992 a quarter of a million of the world's children are dying every week and millions more are surviving in the half-life of malnutrition and almost permanent ill health. This is not a threatened tragedy or impending crisis; it is happening today. If this number of children were killed in an earthquake, flood, cyclone, then the nations of the world would be catapulted into action. And so I welcome the summit initiative. These children are the poor and the powerless and they are the victims of preventable conditions: malnutrition, disease and war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ratified the world declaration in May 1991. In September 1991, the then Prime Minister endorsed the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) having carriage of developing the Government's response to the world declaration. He could not have chosen a more socially conscious person to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has taken the responsibility very seriously and, to date, the following work is under way: a high level interdepartmental committee, referred to by the honourable member for Dundas, has been established to coordinate the Government response. The Committee has met three times, most recently on 5 February, and is currently drafting the Australian reply to the plan of action and to the key and sectoral goals listed in that plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the plan of action will require involvement of all levels of government and non-government organisations and, of course, the Opposition. The then Prime Minister expanded the net of shared responsibility to all State Premiers and Territory Chief Ministers last year, seeking their support and involvement in the development of Australia's plan. The Minister will follow this up with discussions on the Australian plan at the next health and social welfare Ministers conference in April in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has also written to all national peak bodies&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;advising them of the arrangements in place for the plan, inviting their important and essential contribution to the Australian document. The invitation enlists the cooperation of nearly 40 non-government organisations representing all major women's, youth, public health, charitable, Aboriginal and family policy organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Minister recently met with senior UN officials in New York to discuss the Government's development of our strategy. The UN has agreed to Australia lodging an interim report by the end of March 1992 and then a full report with input from all levels of government and the non-government sector by the end of the year. Thus, in that time, we will be able to build up a response that comes from the Australian community with the leadership of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has established a full process for finalisation of the Australian plan of action and processes to report on our strategies and progress in meeting the goals listed in that plan. I am pleased to report that Australia is in fact well in advance of most industrialised countries in preparing our national program of action. As a matter of interest, no other industrialised country has yet completed its plan of action report. Only two countries&mdash;the United States and Japan&mdash;have completed a draft report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN planning and coordinating office for the plan of action is briefed on Australian action to date&mdash;we are working closely there&mdash;and is expecting our draft plan of action by the end of March. I understand that, of the 116 member countries in the UN, 23 have progressed beyond Australia and completed their national program of action&mdash;all of them from developing nations for whom the plan is principally intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it behoves us all in the developed nations to honour that commitment which we have already given. That is what the Government is doing. It is honouring its commitment to implement the plan of action arising from the World Summit of Children. We take it very seriously. We recognise the international responsibility of Australia as a mature nation with much to offer in alleviating the need of children worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the declaration itself notes, countless children around the world are exposed to dangers that hamper their growth and their development. Each day, 40,000 children die from malnutrition and disease, including AIDS, from lack of clean water, from inadequate sanitation and from the effects of drug problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems are especially rife where they can least bear them&mdash;in the least developed countries. The major goals listed in the plan to be addressed by each country focus on child and maternal health, on basic health care provision, on education and literacy, on the alleviation of poverty, and on renewing economic growth. The task for all countries in the United Nations is to ensure services and support for the fundamental needs of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration states that at present over 100 million children are without basic schooling&mdash;the key to opportunity to be able to better their situation&mdash;and two-thirds of them are girls. The provision of basic education and literacy for all is among the most important contributions that can be made to the development of the world's children. Half a million mothers die each year from causes related to childbirth. Safe motherhood&mdash;prenatal and postnatal care&mdash;must be promoted in all possible ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does Australia stand in achieving some of the major goals and targets set out in the plan of action? I am forced to be briefer than I wish to. Infant mortality&mdash;that is, mortality of babies and children under five years&mdash;currently stands at around 10 per 100,000. That is 0.01 per cent. In the US mortality stands at 11 deaths per 100,000. Neither figure is good. It is a bad situation, but I must report on the comparative situation. Maternal mortality in Australia is currently around 3 per cent per 100,000, or 0.003 per cent, a record on maternal health that compares favourably to the US and UK statistic of eight per 100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third major goal of the plan of action endorsed by Australia is to ensure universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of pre-school children. In Australia in 1992 we have a net primary school enrolment ratio of 97 per cent for boys and 98 per cent for girls. These are some examples of the major goals which Australia must address in the plan of action. Maternal health and education are vital to ensuring the protection and survival of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly mention two key areas of government action that are pertinent to our achieving the goals set out in the plan of action, that is, the national women's health program and the national Aboriginal health strategy. The Government has stated in the national agenda for women its commitment to developing a comprehensive women's health policy and has nominated areas for action, including establishment of national breast and cervical cancer screening programs, promoting increased community awareness of sexually transmissible disease and teenage pregnancy, funding of non-government family planning services, research into contraception, evaluating home birth services, and improving accessibility to and availability of health services, including health education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to record my appreciation to the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) in allowing indulgence for the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) to continue his speech in this quite important debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the developing nations 40,000 children under the age of five will die from preventable causes and diseases. Twenty-five thousand of these children will not have reached their first birthday. We are talking about a disaster of almost unbelievable proportions. It is a catastrophe that is occurring not once in a lifetime, not once in a decade, not even once in a year, but every single day&mdash;every 24 hours. These awesome statistics represent the tragic reality behind the words of the motion before the House. We should think about it for a moment, because it is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of the problem we are confronting: almost 15 million children&mdash;the equivalent of almost the entire population of Australia&mdash;dying unnecessarily each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time allocated for the debate on this motion today, 2,000 more children will die. Twenty-eight will have died by the time I complete this sentence. The figures are terrible enough but what is even more terrible is the fact that many of these deaths are preventable. As a result of modern medical and scientific techniques and developments, we already have at our disposal the means by which we can prevent or cure&mdash;quite easily and for relatively little cost&mdash;the diseases which kill so many of these children. Diseases such as measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhoea, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria and polio are now almost non-existent or well under control in the majority of the developed countries. But these are still the childhood killers in the developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each day almost 8,000 children die from measles, whooping cough and tetanus&mdash;all of which can be prevented by inexpensive vaccines. Each day almost 7,000 children die from dehydration resulting from diarrhoea. The cost to cure each child is a few cents. Each day 6,000 children die from pneumonia, which can be readily and successfully treated with low cost antibiotics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infectious diseases are not the only problem. Malnutrition is also a major threat. Despite the fact that we already possess the skills and technologies to produce more than enough food to feed the world, deaths from malnutrition amongst children in the developing world are, in fact, increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that at present more than 40 per cent of children under five in the developing world suffer from malnutrition. One-third go to bed hungry every night of their lives. That figure of 40 per cent represents more than 150 million children. In reality, the number may be much higher. Nearly 23 million children are classified as being severely malnourished. This means they weigh about 70 per cent, or less, than the norm for their age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all of these children will actually die of starvation, although most will suffer permanent physical and mental damage. However, because inadequate diet weakens the immune system and thus increases a child's vulnerability to infections which may otherwise be easily overcome, malnutrition is regarded as a major contributory factor in the overall death toll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people believe that famine, war and poverty are the only causes of malnutrition, but this perception is not correct. Lack of basic nutritional information, inadequate health care, unclean water and unsanitary conditions can also result in severe malnourishment. The problem will not be solved simply by providing handouts of food in times of crises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of truth and commonsense in the well-known saying which was first adopted and widely used in the 1960s by the Freedom From Hunger Campaign: `If you give a man a fish, you give him a meal; if you teach him how to fish, you feed him for the rest of his life.' That one simple word `teach' holds the key to many of the developing world's current problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to wait for miracles. We already have the knowledge. We know what the solutions are and many of them are directly and significantly related to providing better education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something must be done. Something can be done. It is simply a matter of establishing the correct priorities and then getting on with the job. We must not sit back waiting for others to make the first move, or be lulled into a sense of false security by thinking this problem belongs to someone else. All too often when overseas aid issues are discussed one hears the argument, `Charity begins at home'. Perhaps it does, but that does not mean it should end there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, we have our challenges on the home front. For example, about three years ago it was estimated that 500,000 Australian children were living in poverty. In 1990 the figure had risen to 800,000 and was still climbing. Many Aboriginal children still suffer chronic ill health, with mortality rates significantly higher than the Australian average. Yes, we have our difficulties, but we can no longer afford the luxury of only worrying about our own backyard because we simply do not have our own backyard any more. Today, our backyard includes the rest of the world, and it is some of our closest neighbours who are suffering most from the problems addressed during the World Summit for Children in 1990. At that time it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A successful World Summit can make the 1990s the decade in which the shameful large scale deaths and widespread malnutrition of the world's children are consigned to history, providing a permanent gift from the last decade of the 20th century to the people of the new century.</PARA>
<PARA>They were stirring words and a worthy objective. But what is actually being done to turn the rhetoric into reality? Unfortunately, very little, and time is running out fast. Fine words are all very well, but what is needed is some adequate and appropriate action. We have to stop talking and start doing. According to UNICEF's state of the world's children report for 1991, in addition to the 40,000 children who are still dying each day from preventable malnutrition and disease, there are 150 million more children in ill health and suffering from poor growth, and over 100 million children aged between 6 and 11 who are not in school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can endorse, express support for, sign and ratify declarations and conventions which we are told will advance the cause of the world's children until we are blue in the face, but in the final analysis the problems will remain unless and until the parliamentary and bureaucratic Neros at home and abroad actually stop fiddling and start implementing practical solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are busy stating our good intentions, developing official responses, examining options, consulting with other government and non-government organisations, establishing formal departmental mechanisms, committing ourselves to this, and pursuing that, out in the real world the situation is getting worse not better. Some women are still having to spend five hours or more each day carrying water home to their families, water which often is not even safe to drink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred million children of primary school age are not getting any education at all. About 50 per cent of adult women and 30 per cent of adult men are illiterate. Over 500,000 maternal deaths&mdash;99 per cent of them from developing countries&mdash;are occurring each year as a result of pregnancy and childbirth. Millions of children are dying from preventable causes and millions more are suffering from exploitation and abuse or are the innocent victims of wars and other forms of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to acknowledge the problem and accept our obligations to assist in finding some solutions. However, actually doing something about it&mdash;making something happen&mdash;is the real challenge. This motion, moved by my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;and I commend him for his initiative in this regard&mdash;is an attempt to get the bureaucratic transmission system out of first gear and into overdrive before the whole thing bogs down completely. That is what usually happens if you keep the wheels turning for too long in the one spot. We have to get a move on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now almost 18 months since the World Summit for Children. Since then more than 20 million children have died needlessly. The promises have been made. Surely it is time that they be honoured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), I acknowledge the commitment that has been shown by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), a Liberal, regarding the plight of children, his special concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is anyone who would not support the objectives that were enunciated at the World Summit for Children in 1990: they have cross-party support. The objectives and goals are such that they have to be pursued. I strongly support what the honourable member for Casey has said. This is not a time for political point scoring. I certainly hope that has not been the objective of the honourable member for Casey or the honourable member for Dundas in the vague criticisms of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to elaborate on some of the things that have been done, because this Government has acted in a number of ways and it is not just tied up in bureaucratic red tape. We have to understand that we are dealing with a worldwide problem. That is the complexity of the problem, yet we have an opportunity to take advantage of changing circumstances in the world. I cannot think of any other time in the last four or five decades when there has been such an opportunity to redirect the wealth of the world, to redirect our expenditure, to those who need it most. There is clearly that opportunity, because of the reductions in the tensions between East and West and the agreement to cut back on nuclear weaponry, defence forces and expenditure on the instruments of war. This is the time to grab those dollars and put them where they are most needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the United States talked about a new world order. I think we need to set a new world priority that simply should be caring for kids. If we can do that by way of all-party agreement and international agreement then we can get things done. But it is not as simple as some would have it; it is not a matter of a magic wand approach. As I have considered the motion moved by the honourable member for Dundas, I have come to appreciate very much the fetters and barriers that exist because of the sovereignty of nations, the differences in culture, and the discrimination in some nations against women and children, particularly female children. There are also problems in terms of trying to get other nations to set different priorities and to set this priority on a fast-track agenda, so it is not going to be simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, an international problem, and one that comes back to our own nation, is a belief amongst people that if we are going to give assistance, make sure it gets to those who need it. In the past we have tended to leave many services to voluntary organisations. One could list pages and pages of those across the world that have helped those in need. But there is always the fear that if we give, our aid may not get there because of problems that exist in other administrations and the cost of delivery and transport. We need to address that. Whilst I understand why the honourable member for Casey would argue that this is a worldwide problem and that we need to deal with it on a worldwide basis&mdash;and I hope I am not flying in the face of the opinion of others&mdash;we need to take a regional and very domestic approach to this issue. I do not see that we, as a nation of 17 million people with our limited resources, can be trying to address the problems in South America or Africa. We could do much more good if we were to target our own neighbourhood, the South Pacific and the South East Asian area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the new world approach would be that nations who have wealth in the industrial structure were given a backyard, as it were&mdash;and I take the comment by the honourable member for Casey&mdash;and that was their responsibility, then maybe some of these changes could be fast-tracked. There is no-one who would not argue for a reduction in infant and child mortality; there is no-one who would not support a reduction in maternal mortality; there is no-one who would not want a reduction in malnutrition&mdash;and so the list goes on. But saying to someone that we are going to try as a nation to deal with the world I do not think is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government we also have a responsibility to start at home first. I know we have an international responsibility. I accept that, and I believe our Government has endeavoured to meet that responsibility, not only at a discussion stage at world summits but also within our region and through the Commonwealth of Nations. We are certainly trying to do what we can for our own nation, but money is not the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter how much money a government pours into a project, that does not guarantee its success. I recall the comments by the previous Prime Minister when he expressed the desire that no child in this nation should have to live in poverty. That was a principle that was desirable, it was acceptable across the nation, but to say that that can automatically happen just because governments give money is simply not understanding the problem. There is no guarantee that parents will spend their money on their children, and we have seen this in the Aboriginal and Islander area where special assistance had been given in the education field. But questions are raised today on whether that money is being well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money that is given under family allowance supplement has been massively increased by this Government. We have ensured that hundreds of thousands of families are benefiting from this assistance, as with rental assistance. When it comes into that area, into a structural form, we can be assured that it will be spent on residences, on accommodation. But when governments give cash, there is no guarantee that it is going to be spent to improve the quality of life of children. We hope that it works out that way, we hope that parents take up their responsibility and give due priority to the children's needs. But this Government, understanding that, has seen a need to build an income support system. It has seen a need to ensure that FAS is available. In fact, there are now 1.5 million children in this country receiving family allowance supplement and this is being increased immediately by another $3 per week. It is part of that $300m package for low income families and children. It will be dollars in the hand but we can only hope as a parliament that it will be used properly on the kids. This is the same whether one looks at it nationally or internationally: will the money be spent properly? Accountability and monitoring are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government have embarked on a campaign to reduce child poverty. We have raised child payments to something like 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension. We have committed ourselves to a yearly increase. As I mentioned before, we have family payments targeting the low income families; we also have FAS and rent assistance. We have seen a massive increase in these in the last few years. Since 1983 family payments have increased by something like 92 per cent for families with two kids below the age of 13 years and 135 per cent for those between the ages of 13 and 15. And yet there are still problems out there. A half a million kids are still in trouble, so we really need to rethink our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have ensured as an Australian government and as a nation that we have a health insurance system called Medicare to guarantee that the million families that were not covered before are now protected with health insurance and some support medically. We have ensured also that there has been money for public housing. We have tried to address the problems of child violence. It was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Ms Fatin) who set up the National Child Protection Council, and honourable members will recall that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has also involved himself in terms of changing the Family Law Act to try to handle cases of child abuse. So we even have Family Court staff required to report suspected cases of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying to the House is that financially we have tried to do our bit; legislatively we have tried to do our bit; in a monitoring and accountability aspect we have tried to do our bit&mdash;and yet the problem still exists. We do have a youth social justice strategy, we are targeting child homelessness, we are targeting Aboriginal and Islander children. We have a range of programs. The SAAP program, the supported accommodation assistance program, is excellent. It has been hailed as one of the great initiatives of this Government&mdash;and yet there are still kids who do not have a bed at night. Every night now under our scheme there are something like 10,000 women and children being accommodated, but it is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the points that have been raised by the honourable members who spoke before me that we need to make this the top priority. Whilst we have invested millions of dollars, in fact $1.5 billion, just in child-care, there is need for more. We need to expand our vision from the domestic to the regional to the international. So I support what the honourable member for Dundas said and I support very much the comments made by the honourable member for Lilley because I think she got to the kernel of the issue here. But we need to work on these issues together, we need to cast aside party political affiliations and say, `We have responsibility as a parliament to care for kids in this country, in our region and across the world'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While women in this country fight for the right not to be patronised and to be judged for their abilities and not their gender, many women in Third World countries are fighting for the right to live and for the right for their daughters to live. In many cultures, probably most, sons are preferred to daughters, with a consequent higher mortality and poorer lifestyle for female children. Studies in India and Bangladesh show that girls are breastfed for a shorter period and are given less nourishment than are boys. In other Asian countries it is the girls whose rations are cut when there is a food shortage; it is the girls who are denied medicine when there is an epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Female infanticide still occurs in China and more girls than boys die before the age of five. Some African countries still practise female circumcision, with its consequent negative effects on women's health. Five hundred million women die each year in childbirth. Two-thirds of the world's 1,000 million illiterate adults and 100 million illiterate children are female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was collecting these statistics I was interested to read that `studies conducted in Kenya and Indonesia have shown the higher the level of the mother's education, the lower the infant mortality rate' and, further, that `an uneducated girl's prospects for self-improvement are not good, which in turn affects her children's prospects'. I am sure that this is true, but there is an underlying message that I find a little discomforting. It is that women's education must be fostered because it will advantage the health and prospects of her children. Even in Western literature we can still detect the belief that a woman's role as an individual is not as important as her role as a nurturer of children. I would have no objection to this if the role of men was also seen in this light. I believe the survival of children is the most important thing we can work for and the welfare of both men and women should be subservient to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, whether we are in a boom or a recession, Australia has an obligation to assist global action to save children and improve their lives in our own and other countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The absence of a Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony is a good indicator of the state of politics in a candidate's country. The refusal of the Burmese junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to accept the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize in December was symbolic of its continuing repression of the democracy movement. Various human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Asia Watch, have published documented reports about the total lack of basic freedoms under martial law imposed by the military junta since it seized power in September 1988 and its continuing refusal to respect the results of the May 1990 elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Amnesty, as many as 1,500 political prisoners have been arrested since 1988. About 200 were arrested in the first seven months of last year alone, some of whom received prison sentences of up to 25 years. Those gaoled included elected members of parliament, student activists and Buddhist monks. According to the United Nations, Burma's growing prison population now includes hundreds and hundreds of children. The reasons for detention range from distributing party leaflets, talking about a possibility of a provisional government, to putting up posters of national heroes at a national festival and writing an exam paper in an ethnic minority language. UNICEF is now attempting to help these children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burmese `outlaw government' denies holding any political prisoners, maintaining that all those incarcerated are common criminals and insurgent terrorists. The junta is thus trying to eliminate non-violent opposition the same way as it has dealt with armed insurrection. The results of these policies have been tragic. Human rights abuses, forced labour, torture and execution of civilians that were previously witnessed along the Thai boarder are now being committed nationwide. Entire villages have been razed and thousands of people are forced to relocate. Some 20,000 refugees have crossed the border into China. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced as a result of the Army offensive against the guerillas of the current ethnic minority. Most have fled to Thailand, joining more than 40,000 people already living in at least 16 refugee camps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a terror campaign against the Muslim minority, up to 100,000 refugees from the Arakan state have been forced to take refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. Only last month, nearly 1,500 villagers fled to the Indian state of Nagaland to escape fighting in Burma's Sagaing Division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The junta's strongest foreign supporter is China, which has emerged as Burma's leading trading partner and main arms supplier. It has agreed to give a $US9.3m free interest loan for unspecified economic projects and to build a television station. Under a deal worth at least $US1.4 billion, China has been supplying the regime with a wide range of weaponry, including jet fighters, tanks, artillery, patrol boats and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries that have been guilty of supplying arms to this repressive regime include Pakistan, Yugoslavia and other cash-strapped eastern European countries. According to reports, Swedish rockets, manufactured under licence in Singapore, have been sold to the junta. Even Japan became involved. In 1990 it shipped at least 500 trucks to Rangoon, ostensibly for civilian purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modernised and expanded Burmese armed forces&mdash;they now comprise over 300,000 troops&mdash;have shown scant respect for the territorial integrity of Burma's neighbours. Burmese troops have repeatedly crossed into Thailand in order to attack rebel bases from the rear. In August last year Burmese troops penetrated 30 kilometres into the Indian State of Mizoram to capture dissidents. In December last year, they clashed with the Bangladesh army inside Bangladesh territory, resulting in casualties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With peaceful political dissent in Burma virtually stifled, it has become vital that international pressure be applied against the military junta in order to compel the regime to respect fundamental human rights. Unless pressure, both diplomatic and economic, is significantly escalated, the military junta will be able to continue its repressive regime while Australia and the rest of the international community do not match their rhetoric with action. The world reacted with shock and horror at the events in Tiananmen Square; that event pales into insignificance compared with the savagery being perpetrated by the brutal regime in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Efforts over the past year to increase diplomatic pressure have been a good beginning. The United Nations General Assembly's resolution in November last year&mdash;this was the first human rights resolution critical of a particular country ever to receive unanimous endorsement&mdash;is an auspicious beginning. Expressing its concern at the grave human rights situation, the resolution stressed the need for an early improvement of the situation and urged the Burmese Government to allow all citizens to participate freely in the political process in accordance with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">United Nations resolutions are not enough unless they are backed up. While Australia, the European Community and the United States have imposed an embargo on military sales and, in some cases, banned economic assistance, the Burmese Government has yet to feel its impact. For example, while the World Bank has refrained from funding new projects, it has continued disbursements for projects sanctioned before 1988. These amounted to about $37m in 1991, besides providing more than $80m in debt relief since 1988. Japan, following the same policy, disbursed more than $130m in 1991. So it goes on from other Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cessation of aid programs is not enough. Industrialised countries have refused to ban investment and trade activities in Burma. Since October 1989, eight oil companies have signed oil exploration contracts with the military junta and paid blood money. This includes BHP, which reportedly paid the junta $6m to explore for oil. Such actions can only bolster the confidence of the regime and also give it reassurance that future oil revenues are in the offing. Singapore, Japan and South Korea are important trading partners and sources of vital spare parts and other goods critical to the Burmese economy. Indeed, to Australia's shame, we even repaired aircraft parts there last year for the Burmese armed forces. The Thai Government has signed lucrative deals with the junta which involve stripping the country of its precious resources, including teak, gems and fish, while ignoring the plight of the Burmese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very importantly, I want to make a comment about ASEAN. Burma's immediate neighbours, the ASEAN countries, have been singularly reluctant to comment on the atrocities of the regime and prefer to take shelter behind a professed policy of what they hypocritically call `constructive engagement'. At the ASEAN summit last month, Singapore's Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not interfere . . . we just have our bilateral contacts.</PARA>
<PARA>The Philippines Foreign Minister, Raul Manglapus, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not going to tell them to restore democracy. We want to see how we can cooperate with them.</PARA>
<PARA>What a disgrace. The consequences of such a pitiful response, both regional and international, to the atrocities of Burma are obvious. They have been condemned in the United States Senate, where Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York has said that ASEAN is weak and has failed its responsibility as an economic group within South East Asia to continue to criticise what is happening in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Australian Government to introduce in the United Nations a proposal exploring the possibility of denying the Burmese Government its credentials as a member of the United Nations and calling on the United Nations to ensure that economic sanctions against Burma encompassing aid, trade and investment are brought into play as soon as possible. </PARA>

All I said was, `Look, the people of Tasmania have shown what they think of the Labor Party, its alliance with the Greens, and what it did to Tasmania'. So that was my answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start to grieve a bit. I am particularly worried about what is happening in Tasmania at the moment. The Liberal Party was elected there; we are all pretty fair. The Greens got 12 per cent of the vote. Suddenly we had, first of all, a train hold-up. Some people decided to hold up a train in Tasmania and got away with it. The media gave them plenty of publicity, but they got away with it. That is okay. Then I saw that two people, one of whom was here on holiday from England&mdash;that lovely country&mdash;decided to stow away on a French boat which was to go to the Antarctic. The other stowaway was a Tasmanian. I will name him. I have named him publicly today. I am not a gutless wonder as honourable members all know.

But I go back to this Grant Douglas Maddock. I watched that protest at the Picton River. Sure enough, Grant Douglas Maddock was one of the protesters.

I said that the Department of Social Security and the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) should have a look at the protesters down at the Picton River to find out who was unemployed and why those who were unemployed were not looking for a job.

All I was saying was that if these people are unemployed, they should be looking for a job. That is fair enough, is it not? Do honourable members not agree? Even my colleagues on the other side would agree. If someone is unemployed, he should be looking for a job. He should not be stopping other people from trying to find work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have created a problem in Tasmania. The police do not want to go in there and stop them. Do honourable members know why? They do not want to go in there because they do not want to see that famous doctor down there, Dr Bob Brown, being pulled out from under a bulldozer because that gives credence to his kind. It makes a paper god of him. Television stations everywhere&mdash;including the ABC; you name it&mdash;always show Dr Bob Brown being pulled out of a mud pile away from a tractor. They show him as a martyr. There is no thought for the ordinary worker down there, no thought for me or any of my kind who try to stick up for the inarticulate who cannot express themselves, the people who do not want to be involved in this sort of thing because they are frightened of reprisal. No, just Dr Bob Brown. I hope I am making my point clearly because it is terribly important. </PARA>

If we let them stop trains, board a French ship as stowaways, go to the Picton River and stop decent people from finding a job, what is going to happen? So we have to fight them and fight them hard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxpayers of Australia are crying out for reform. These taxpayers cannot even afford to pay their own bills so, when they see somebody stopping another person from finding a job, of course they get nasty and angry.

It cannot be stopped because they are frightened of the publicity that the greenies will be given. That is all they want&mdash;publicity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in this House the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) delivered an economic statement that will provide the path for recovery for this nation into the next decade. It was a broad-based policy; it was Labor policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Truss)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! I would remind the honourable member for Hinkler of standing order 82 which prevents discussion of a matter which is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for this day. The honourable member is not really at liberty to discuss in this debate the specifics of that statement. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not do that because there will be plenty of time over the next 12 months for both sides of the House to discuss that policy. However, what is clear and significant from last night's statement is that the community now has a clear choice between two ideologies. Last night the Prime Minister outlined Labor's ideology and late last year the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) outlined the conservative ideology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never since Federation has Australia seen such a clear choice. Even though people are probably a little more articulate and wear newer or flashier suits than they did in 1890, the choice today is exactly as it was in 1890. When one takes away the wrappings, the real choice is between grassroots Labor philosophy, as outlined in the policy statement last night, and tory philosophy, as outlined in the Fightback package. I welcome that because it gives people a chance over the next 12 months to see in which direction each political party wishes to take this nation. It is the responsibility of both sides of this House to argue and articulate the reasons why people should endorse either point of view. I certainly welcome that challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it will take time for the general public to digest the various policy statements from both sides, there is no doubt in my mind that it is a clear choice between, on the Government's side, vision, a future for this nation, and compassion and understanding, and, on the other side of the House, special privilege. The only clearly unique thing to have come out of the Fightback package is the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said in this House yesterday&mdash;and will be said again and again across this country&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition and the conservatives have embraced a goods and services tax in order to be different. The goods and services tax has existed in Canada for something like 12 months and has been an unmitigated disaster. Why any political party would wish to embrace so dearly a tax that is regressive and distributes wealth from average wage earners, pensioners, the disabled, the unemployed and struggling farmers to the wealthy defies logic. That is really the clear choice that is going to be argued in this place and outside it over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real bottom line is that one cannot tax one's way out of a recession with a regressive tax. Worse than that, when one analyses the effects on this country of a goods and services tax, one sees that it is even more illogical that the Leader of the Opposition and the conservative parties would wish to embrace such a tax. First of all, it is inflationary. We are now in a better position to be internationally competitive. Inflation is down to 1 1/2 per cent and we are leading the OECD&mdash;I think only one other country in the OECD has a lower level of inflation than Australia. At a time when we have achieved that and we are in a position to expand and develop our export markets, the Opposition wants to bring in a tax that would simply blow inflation through the roof and destroy that competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a trading nation and we have to export the bulk of our commodities. We have a population of only 18 million. Not only do our primary industries, our resource industries, have to sell their products overseas; our expanding manufacturing industries also have to sell a large part of their products overseas. Consequently, it defies logic to bring in a policy that would disadvantage the export sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What disappoints me more than that is what this regressive tax will do to people on low and fixed incomes. I was at a meeting only last week with a group of pensioners. One elderly lady, who is a widow, said to me that she had spent over $3,000 renovating her home. Under a goods and services tax she would be paying 15 per cent tax on those renovations. That lady is on a fixed income. One could give many other examples of people on fixed incomes who would be hit with the tax. But if one looks at equity and superannuants&mdash;people who have provided for their own retirement; people who have either some very small or, in many cases, no pension at all because they do not come under the level&mdash;one will see that those people will pay 15 per cent tax as soon as they take a dollar out of the bank. But they have already paid tax on their money. They have paid tax on their money through their life, but they will be taxed again at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is it going to achieve? It has been argued that it is going to abolish wholesale sales tax, which at the present time contributes something like $10,000m to the economy, and replace it with a tax that will pick up something like&mdash;and it is arguable&mdash;$25 billion. The point is that it is going to come out of people's pockets. The point is that every time somebody puts his hand in his pocket when he goes into a supermarket, a drapery or any store whatsoever, the Opposition's hand goes in too. Fifteen per cent tax goes into the coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the rural sector&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I acknowledge that you have a compassion and understanding, as you have a large rural electorate like mine&mdash;one will find that many farmers will pay no tax this year and some will pay very little or no tax next year because of commodity prices, the drought and, in some instances, sadly and ironically, the floods that we now have. Yet under the conservative policy, those farmers will pay 15 per cent tax on everything they purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the rhetoric about compensating the export sector, but let us look at the industries that do not have an export market or that have a very small export market. Let us look at the fruit and vegetable industry. It is a $700m industry for Queensland; 15 per cent of $700m is $100m&mdash;$100m in tax. This tax will not go to the growers, the agents, or the transport companies; it will go into Consolidated Revenue. It will dampen demand because families have a limited amount of money to spend. If 15 per cent at the retail level is going to go in tax, only 85 per cent of their purchasing capacity will go back to farmers. That is what it really means. What is so bad about it is that there is no tax on fruit and vegetables at present. There is no wholesale sales tax; there is no tax whatsoever on fruit and vegetables, meat, bread and milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservative philosophy is to tax the basic necessities of life. So it is going to be very easy over the next 12 months to highlight the difference between opposing philosophies. I believe that only once will the conservative parties regret the goods and services tax&mdash;for the rest of their political lives, because what it will do to the Australian people will ultimately be done to their political fortunes: it will destroy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is only part of the Fightback policy. One of the worst aspects of it is the industrial relations policy, the free-for-all, a return to 1890. It is ironic, as I said at the start, that nothing has changed and that the tories today are no different to what they were in 1890. There is talk of using the waterfront; talk that workers will have to work more for less today, as the Leader of the Opposition has said; and talk of throwing troops into the waterfront. They are no different to the arrogant squatters who in 1890 bought a crooked magistrate in Rockhampton and sent 600 troops out to Barcaldine. Nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next 12 months I am certainly going to welcome the opportunity to articulate the differences between the philosophy of special privilege that those on the other side of the House espouse and the philosophy that we on this side of the House put forward. Certainly, last night was the start of the debate, and we are going to win. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On numerous occasions in this place over the last four years I have referred to 10 February 1964 as one of the worst disasters in the peacetime history of this nation and of the Royal Australian Navy. Many honourable members will recognise that I speak of the collision between the destroyer HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> and the aircraft carrier and flagship of that time, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne</EMPHASIS>, off Jervis Bay, claiming 82 lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1988, both in this place and outside, I have supported the compensation case for some 80 survivors through to a successful High Court supposedly precedent setting action for one of them in 1990&mdash;the so-called Verwayen case. Although that gentleman's claim has now been settled, regrettably many other survivors and their families still bear the scars of the tragedy: the scars of psychological trauma, of persistent nervous shock, of domestic instability, of financial strain and, very importantly in this parliamentary setting, of misplaced confidence in a government which espouses social justice&mdash;a point repeated last evening by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement&mdash;but, alas, a government which demonstrably has failed to put its money where its mouth is and has failed to live up to its compassionate rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year I was informed of another two cases&mdash;one in Victoria, the other in Queensland&mdash;where claimants have succumbed physically and/or emotionally to the trauma of the Government's continuing obstructionism. To illustrate, I refer to an editorial entitled `Justice at last' in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in September 1990, which stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view that the Commonwealth has behaved with despicable bureaucratic self-interest in the Voyager case would result in very little argument in the general community. The High Court ruling, paving the way for compensation claims by the survivors of that horrific 1964 naval accident, is a signal victory for social justice.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth long denied liability for compensation. Mr Hawke's first government lifted the statute of limitations on the case in 1985, then slammed the door&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in 1986&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when it found there might be substantial compensation claims in the offing.</PARA>
<PARA>The High Court Verwayen judgment supposedly means that the Commonwealth, as the employer of people paid to defend the country, cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if they come to harm in the course of their natural or normal duties. This is not only an important precedent but also a simple reflection of elementary justice, albeit achieved in this instance only after a tortuous confrontation with the Commonwealth. I regret to say that the path to justice continues to be obstructed by the Commonwealth at every turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the Victorian case I referred to earlier, at long last on Monday of this week the Supreme Court in Victoria cleared the way for that survivor, Mr Clark, to pursue his $800,000 damages claim against the Commonwealth. Mr Clark told the court that he had received medical and psychiatric treatment over the past 27 years. The judge said he was of a view that the psychological effect on Mr Clark of the loss of the expectation of compensation would be devastating. The judge also ruled that the Commonwealth was not entitled to rely on a combat defence; that is, that naval exercises at the time of the disaster in 1964 were so interwoven in military procedure that the Commonwealth owed no duty of care to the Navy personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and Defence Ministers present and previous are perpetuating such injustices by refusing to intervene and by relying on legalistic jingoism in each individual case. Squirm as they may about their rationale, Ministers know that the bottom line for the Commonwealth is a total compensation bill of perhaps $30m. That is their real objection, but they continue to rely on every peripheral, arguably specious, defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Attorney-General in particular to page 45 of Mr Justice Coldrey's judgment in the Clark case, where he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would, of course, have been open to the defendant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in this case the Commonwealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if it lost the Verwayen case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which indeed it did&mdash;</PARA>

However, the history of these cases indicates that this was never regarded by the Commonwealth as a relevant consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say simply to the Attorney-General: enough is enough. Forget the historical differences. Why continue the frustration and desperation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> survivors? Why continue to prolong the judicial processes when the results are inevitable, and why not make some out of court settlement to each in this group to be negotiated quickly, and very quickly indeed?</PARA>

On the broader issues in the book, once again question marks arise about some of the evidence given in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> royal commissions of 1964 and 1967. This is reiterated by Tom Frame's account of the deathbed admission of a great Australian, the late Governor of New South Wales, Sir David Martin, about some of his incomplete evidence given as a young naval officer at that time. </PARA>

However, it remains a national tragedy that the public at large, particularly many of the families of the 82 men who died, may never have the undisputed truth.

I hope that he will ensure that 1992 sees all outstanding <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation claims cleared from the Commonwealth's books.

Some will not remember that it was Menzies who excluded the first child in 1941 when child endowment was brought in. But in 1949 it was a good election winner, and in 1950, on election to office, he delivered on that promise&mdash;five shillings for the first child. When Menzies retired in 1966, the endowment for the first child had never been altered. It was altered on 14 February 1966&mdash;it became 50c with the advent of decimal currency. A delivery!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1953 the Prime Minister told Australians that they had three years to prepare for war.

In 1966 we fought the election on `All the way with LBJ'. Young Australians were conscripted to go to Vietnam in exchange for certain economic concessions from the United States Government. That is why Australians went to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1963 the Liberals made a big fuss about the fact that the Labor Party Federal Conference met in secret&mdash;the 36 faceless men. The number was not right, but that is not important. The Liberal Party Council still meets in secret. Its members are not prepared to have their discussions out in the open and in the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 we had the notorious pump-up Budget which the then Treasurer admitted before it was passed through this Parliament contained a lot of rubbery figures. It did; $1.5 billion was artificially pumped into the money supply in order to create economic buoyancy before that particular election. That was done because McMahon was going to be beaten; Whitlam was a better leader and a more promising Prime Minister. That was the reason. The conservatives had already dumped a man of substance in John Gorton. They stabbed him in the back. But that was not important. They did not win that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 Australians were made another promise&mdash;people should remember these promises&mdash;`We will index the tax rate so that governments cannot steal funds through bracket creep. Tax thresholds will be automatically increased with inflation'. That promise was never met either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977 the government of the day, immediately before an election, legislated for massive tax cuts and had the people from the Taxation Office working overtime assisting its election campaign by answering people's queries about how much the tax cuts would be as a result of the changes which had been made in the tax rates, which did not apply at that time. The Liberal Party advertising told people, `Ring up the Taxation Office and they will tell you how much you will get from the tax changes'. It is only a coincidence that in that election Gough Whitlam promised to abolish payroll tax by taking back the tax cuts, and the reaction was shock, horror. How many of us remember the handful of dollars? I think $70 was shown as tax cuts, which was about 10 times as much as most people would have ever got.

Despite 10 per cent inflation in every one of the years that Fraser was in office&mdash;and that was the average, 10 per cent&mdash;there was a movement of over 60 per cent in the cost of living. In 1982, when another phoney Budget was brought in for an election, family allowance payments were still set at the rate that they were introduced at in 1976.

In the last eight to 10 years, the only people in the United States who have increased their incomes are those in the top one per cent of income earners. The bottom 90 per cent of Americans are worse off now than when Reagan was elected President over 10 years ago. It is a conservative government there. It has done all of those things that the Leader of the Opposition is promising to do in this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this month more than 300 landowners in my electorate of Forrest, mainly farmers, received a brief letter from the Executive Director of the Australian Heritage Commission. In each case this letter spelt out the Commission's intention to list all or part of the landowner's property under the National Estate. No specific reasons were given for these proposed listings and it comes as no surprise that the landowners began asking questions about the possible ramifications of the Heritage Commission's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this matter is now one of the most significant issues confronting the rural community throughout the south-west of Western Australia. The Heritage Commission, with the assistance of the Department of Conservation and Land Management, CALM, spent around a year assessing the forest regions of the south-west to enable guidelines to be determined for the protection of areas of heritage significance. This included considering areas of listing under the National Estate. Subsequently, a report has been released jointly by the Heritage Commission and CALM which sets out the broad objectives of this whole process of land assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say, at the outset, that the south-west of Western Australia is one of the most diverse regions in Australia. It is the location of some of Australia's most significant resource, extraction and processing industries. It is also characterised by some of the most unique and spectacular areas of environmental significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, the mighty karri and jarrah forests have provided the basis of the local timber industry and at the same time have been a major tourism drawcard. Amongst the forests are nestled the region's farming lands, which add significantly to the region's overall diversity and wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems of previous assessments of the area of possible environmental significance has been the ad hoc approach taken. However, most people agree that the latest approach, which is based on a complete regional assessment, is a better way to go. Indeed, the Heritage Commission in its report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . protection should be focussed on the regional occurrence of each (environmental) value, taking into account its abundance, spatial and temporal distribution, spatial characteristics, variation, and condition, rather than on individual locations of value in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, just because a clump of old jarrah or karri trees is found in an area of little other conservation significance, this does not automatically mean the area should be listed. Instead, it should be considered to determine just how important it is within the whole region. If sufficient karri stands exist elsewhere in appropriate quantities, then there is little sense in restricting the use of this one particular area of land. Clearly, regional land management is the best option, as I will mention later in my speech on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the way this particular region has been assessed leaves much to be desired, not just from the point of view of the farmers but from the point of view of forestry and industry as well. I appreciate that the Heritage Commission has acted fully in accordance with the provisions of its governing legislation. However, while it has consulted jointly and in detail with CALM regarding the areas managed by this Department on behalf of the Crown, this consultation was totally lacking when it came to dealing with areas of privately owned land, which is beyond the general scope of CALM's authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the report is a draft and that landowners are entitled to make submissions on its recommendations. The fact remains that this report helps cement in place the proposed listing. As anyone who would have dealt with the bureaucracy knows, reaching this stage of the proceedings is like getting one's foot in the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A far more appropriate course of action would have been to involve all the parties concerned with this issue in the planning stages. This includes individual farmers, their representative bodies such as the Pastoralists and Graziers Association and the National Farmers Federation, timber operators and their industry groups and others with entrenched interests in the region, particularly the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of adequate consultation was highlighted by the fact that the Heritage Commission organised a meeting to discuss the issues, yet gave farmers so little notice of the meeting that many were unable to attend. Furthermore, landowners still do not know why their properties were proposed for listing. It is no wonder many people think the whole deal is a fait accompli. Indeed, a letter from the Executive Director of the Heritage Commission goes so far as to describe the whole process as `very successful' and further goes on to say it `will be a model for similar projects both in Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Heritage Commission say it has been `successful' when the full implementations have not been worked out yet. Already, the National Association of Forest Industries has expressed major reservations about some of the recommendations, while the whole farming community is in an uproar about the possible effects on their land holdings. This is hardly a measure of success and I would suggest that judgment should be reserved until the dust has settled and everyone has had time to assess the full impact of this report. What are the main concerns expressed by private property owners whose land has been targeted in the National Estate listing? The Heritage Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A listing in the Register (of the National Estate) has no direct legal constraints on owners of private property. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Why are landowners concerned? In a nutshell, they do not trust the decision makers and they are uncertain about the long term implementations that could be involved. Contrary to the Commission's advice, there are direct legal constraints on listed areas whenever decisions concerning them involve the Commonwealth Government. For instance, if the landowner considers an offer from a foreign investor then the Foreign Investment Review Board may well be involved. This could lead to complications concerning any environmental obligations imposed on a foreign investor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the indirect consequences are worth considering. As no-one is quite sure what approach a future government might take, National Estate listings may be viewed in a bad light by many people. This uncertainty about the future listed lands is bound to be reflected in the values of the properties of land, and landowners disadvantaged accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Heritage Commission's report unwittingly points to yet another major concern; it in part states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because many forests designated for timber production are listed in the Register of the National Estate, national estate forests have increasingly become the focus of a more general debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One result has been an undifferentiated perception by the general public that areas of national estate forests should not be logged; regardless of the values for which they are listed, or their management regime.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commission is virtually admitting that the National Estate listings in themselves attract an irrational response from some quarters. In my experience, most people even confuse National Estate areas with national parks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not too far-fetched to imagine a situation wherein a government would bow to political pressure from lobby groups to clamp down on the use of National Estate areas, thereby restricting the productive value of the areas to landowners. Other aspects of the draft report are of concern as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the report mention is made of appropriate management to protect identified values. Yet there is no indication of what this means for private properties. If a form of land use management has been proposed then the Commission must spell out exactly what this is and what it means to landowners. On the other hand, if the Commission is of the view that National Estate listing never makes any difference to landowners in any way and never makes any difference to the use of their properties, then the obvious question is: why list the land in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time the Government, and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in particular, came out of the shadows and answered these concerns. This is a far-reaching issue for landowners in the south-west and affects their very livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, a report released by CALM sheds even more light on the whole matter and hints at the sort of treatment we might expect in the future. In the report's fine detail, there is mention of how the widest possible range of native landscapes, ecosystems and species can be conserved, including the part where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . identifying and protecting the most threatened habitats by reservation of public land or, in the case of private land, by land purchase, or by negotiation with landowners if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Heritage Commission has now identified what it considers to be significant areas, this particular statement by CALM opens up a Pandora's box as to how those areas may be treated in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, today, asked a number of parliamentary questions of the Minister and, until she is prepared to spell out exactly what the long term implications of this whole matter are, the landowners of the south-west have every right to be concerned. Until the Heritage Commission resolves these matters in full, the coalition believes proposed listings should be withdrawn. If the Commission does not see the sense in this, then the onus is squarely on the Government to use its powers under section 25 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act to direct that these listings should not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My shadow ministerial colleagues Senator Michael Baume and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) have highlighted the importance of cooperative agreements on land management between the Commonwealth and State governments. However, we are of the view that such far-reaching proposals should have involved those who would be directly affected. For these reasons, I call on the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to intervene in the matter and withdraw the proposed National Estate listings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to grieve for what I see as a growing concern about the future of Australia. I have for a long time been concerned that there seems to be a growing dichotomy between rural and urban Australia. One of the facts of life is that most of the wealth in Australia is created in rural areas; the urban areas are there mainly as a result of the wealth that is so created. This is not to say that they are any less worthy, but there has to be this recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have in Australia is that there is a constant battle in this country between what I would call the nationalists, those people who put Australia's interests first, and the internationalists, those people who see Australia as some cog in an international wheel. I think it is true to say that the nationalists have the numbers on the ground, but the internationalists have the power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The internationalists have infiltrated very much into the teaching professions and into the academic and political circles. It is they who have foisted upon us the culture of the colony. For many years Australia was a colony of the United Kingdom. When we could see things changing in Europe, I believe we, with undue haste, helped to push Britain into the Common Market and tied ourselves very rapidly to the apron strings of America. People now want to tie us to the apron strings of Asia. We have been told that Australia is part of Asia; we must become part of this new dynamic region. The first, and probably the worst, offender in this regard, of course, was Garnaut in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy</EMPHASIS>. It is a very worrying thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get to the nub of this matter, we have to say to ourselves, `What is causing this division in Australia? What are we doing in society that is causing this division?'. I put it to you, Mr <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Deputy Speaker, that one of the most profound causes of this is the policy of multiculturalism. It is a policy that has never been supported by the Australian people, for which no government has ever had a mandate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gaudy ties without style and taste. It was implemented as a policy by Malcolm Fraser in a grubby exercise in which he thought he could collar the ethnic vote. There is no ethnic vote and to believe that there is one is inherently racist because it implies that ethnics are more easily manipulated than Australians. But that is how the die has been cast. We now have this very powerful multicultural industry which does not represent migrants, except for a very small number; it represents the sectoral interest of a few people but it has the ear of both major parties in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen an upsurge in demands for republicanism in Australia lately. Republicans have tried to make this a nationalist issue. It is not a nationalist issue; it is an extension of multicultural aims. If people read very carefully what republicans are saying and look at the structure of those groups that are reporting republicanism, they will see that they are heavily infested with well-known multiculturalists. The idea is that Australia has no history, that we must wipe the slate clean, have a clean sheet of history on which people can impose their multicultural version of Australia's history. I find this very offensive; in fact, it is downright dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the multiculturalists are saying that we have no history of our own. I heard the Australian of the Year, Archbishop Hollingworth, speak while I was driving my car and I had to stop I was so appalled. His suggestion was that, as we have no culture of our own, we should adopt the Aboriginal culture, we should be very grateful to the Aborigines for 40,000 years of culture. Would it not be great, this learned gentleman said, if we could all meet in a pub in London and talk to each other in an Aboriginal language so that the Poms could not understand us. That is absurd. Firstly, if Australians talked to Englishmen in London, they probably would not understand them. Secondly, I find that totally ignorant and very, very offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the history of Australia, it is a proud history. We cannot forget, nor should we forget, the history we inherited. If one looks at the contributions Australia has made to the world one finds that Australia gave the world the eight-hour day. Australia gave full adult suffrage. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce female suffrage. Right from the inception of this country as a Federal Commonwealth we have had the vote for women; Britain did not get it until 1922. The Torrens land title system is, in my view, the most equitable form of land ownership in the world. It is now slowly spreading to the United Kingdom and I am sure it will eventually even get into that very backward area of the world in this respect, the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a cause of concern, I believe, for the whole of Australia not only that we are supporting this policy of multiculturalism, but also that we are supporting it while we see it tearing at the very fabric of this nation. If we are to succeed, we are going to have to have a united nation, because only by being a united nation can we be a strong nation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Multiculturalism is fabricated on the basis that culture equates with race. It says that people of different races cannot have the same culture. This, of course, is absolute nonsense. I recall when I was actually censured by this Parliament about four years ago for making a very mild remark. My remark at the time was that we should slow down South East Asian immigration to a rate at which the country could accommodate it. I was censured by both sides of this Parliament on that occasion. The only support I got was from Asians. It came from two sources: what I call the Sri Lankan stream, who said, basically, `We would rather have a British culture and English is our language', and the Chinese, who said, `Look, we like this country here and we don't want all these Asians stuffing it up'. They realised that, in terms of economic downturn, social pressure is going to feed into society intolerable strains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Liberal Party says that it will cut immigration in the long term, if one looks at the history of Liberal Party policy, one will find that it has been a high immigration policy. As was explained to me by one Liberal member recently, `How else are you going to keep wages down?'. That is the Opposition's agenda, certainly not mine. But the fact is that it has agreed, and in the short term it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) actually saying? He is saying, `When the economy turns up, I will vastly increase immigration'. That is a very serious thing; it is a very serious error; it is not what Australia needs. He then compounds this problem by saying,`If we do not increase immigration, somebody will do it for us'. So here, at one fell swoop, the Leader of the Opposition is giving away Australia's national sovereignty. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if the Leader of the Opposition really feels this way it is incumbent on him to immediately abolish Australia's armed forces. He is clearly not prepared to use them and he is clearly going to deliver Australia into the hands of someone else. For my part, I thought that is what we bought the F111 aircraft for&mdash;in the final analysis, to defend Australia's national sovereignty. I believe the national sovereignty cannot be for sale and we must take a strong stand in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every illegal migrant boat that lands on the shores of my electorate puts Australia at risk in the long run. Unless we are prepared to take immediate action&mdash;firstly, to stop this and, secondly, where it is successful, to return the people speedily to their country of origin&mdash;we are putting ourselves at risk. In the future, for instance, when we get 10,000 illegal migrants arriving in a boat, one of the large countries in our area might say to us, `Well, look, we think it would be racist to send these people back to Bangladesh or wherever they come from'. This is a totally intolerable position, as I said. The only way we can overcome it is to increase our surveillance now and to have a firm national resolve that Australia will have none of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Australia has one of the most equitable societies in the world. It is a society that has been developed from a culture which, I believe, has got a lot of good things going for it and it appals me that we are continually subjected to denigration of the history of Australia.

As most honourable members would know, it is amazing if a member's office gets more than a couple of phone calls or letters on an issue. But one subject I recently had a number of phone calls to my office about was the speech on republicanism by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his welcome to the Queen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people phoned my office or contacted me and asked me what right the Prime Minister had, in a speech of welcome to the Queen, to touch on the subject of republicanism. I was absolutely overwhelmed and amazed by the number of people who contacted my office. As we know, these types of comments by the Prime Minister are only a diversion to take people's minds off the real issues in this country, that is, unemployment and our huge foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak today about some things happening in my electorate which I am not pleased about and which I am certain that those people who are experiencing these things are not happy about either. The first issue I want to touch on is the Maude Post Office. Maude is a small township to the west of Hay on the Murrumbidgee River. It is only a small settlement but it has a small shop, a post office agency in the shop and a few other buildings. The people in that area rely very much on that shop and that post office agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that at the moment Australia Post is trying to rationalise its services. We welcome that because we really cannot have an overrun of costs, particularly in a time of a recession, but I think we have to stop and think about what is happening in outback Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that most of the mining ventures and most of the farming ventures where our wealth comes from are in isolated areas or rural areas. No longer do people wish to stay in those areas unless they have services provided to them. Most Australians live on the east coast of Australia or in other coastal belts, whereas those people who produce the wealth of the country live in outback areas in places such as Maude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Australia Post's intention to close down the agency in Maude and have a roadside delivery service. This, of course, will make the shop unviable. I am not just talking about Maude here; there must be many other places the same. I think it is time that those people in politics and in the Public Service thought about just where the wealth of this country is coming from and say to those people who are living in those areas trying to create some wealth, `Look, we will support you. We will keep you there'. If they do not, I am afraid these people will say, `We have had enough&mdash;enough is enough. Our coastal cousins are doing all right in a good climate by the sea. Let's go and join them'. If that happens, I do not know where the wealth of this country will come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another situation in the same vein concerns the mail services around Cobar and Wilcannia. Some of the mail services have been cut from a three-day to a two-day delivery and some from a two-day to a one-day delivery. The same thing goes for these areas as goes for Maude. It is not good enough to cut services. Many of those people rely heavily on the mail service. I would like bureaucrats&mdash;people in the Public Service&mdash;and politicians to think about what they are doing. We really do, as I said before, have to keep those people there on the land creating the wealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another call I have had in the last few weeks came from a gentleman complaining about the Austudy allowance. He was not the only one; we have had many complaints before. Apparently in the past, when $60,000 was earned by both parents, one could still receive $20 a week in Austudy allowance. The amount of earnings applicable to eligibility has been reduced from $60,000 to $40,000 plus so much for each additional child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate&mdash;no doubt in other electorates also&mdash;even in the best of families a slight tiff might develop between teenage children and their parents. The teenagers may want a new motorbike, a push bike or something else; arguments may develop and the children may leave home saying that the money from Austudy should be theirs. Some teenagers cannot get Austudy because their parents earn too much. Others who have an argument with mum and dad move out and, unfortunately in many cases, move into a de facto relationship at a tender age so that they can get the independent Austudy rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people in my electorate who have written to me about this. It is something that I will certainly be taking up with the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) in the hope that something can be done about it. I know that in the payment of any benefit there is always a loophole, but what is happening is affecting families. The payment of this allowance is not meant to do that; it is meant to be a help to families. I think we should look very closely at what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I raise concerns the mining town of Cobar in my electorate. As most people know, the mining industry in that area has run into problems with low metal prices and high operating costs because of the nature of the mines. There has been a decrease in the number of people working in the mines in Cobar. This, added to the problem of drought in the area&mdash;fortunately over the last few weeks we have had some rain around Cobar which may help&mdash;and the recession, has caused a lot of unemployment in Cobar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment in Cobar is handled by the Dubbo office of the Department of Social Security. Dubbo is a fair distance from Cobar. People from Cobar wishing to contact the Department of Social Security can call a 008 number in Dubbo to get assistance. There have been many complaints because when people ring that office&mdash;and we all know the Social Security offices are very busy at the moment&mdash;they are passed from one person to another; the phone drops out; and they have all types of problems. Then, of course, there is a problem with mail, filling out forms and all that type of thing. Many unemployed people have problems in getting their money in time so that they can support their families. It is already a big enough trauma trying to feed one's family, to pay rent and to get on with one's life without having this situation develop. I have written to the Minister for Social Security asking him to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cobar Enterprise Development Agency has collected a petition from the people of Cobar. I believe that the petition has 1,200 names on it. That is a great number of people from an area such as that. That is something else that I would like the Minister to look into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next I touch on the matter of sales tax exemption for those who may be invalid. People who are invalid may purchase a vehicle for travelling to work and that vehicle is exempt from sales tax. But, if they are not working, they cannot claim the sales tax exemption on their vehicle. I have had a letter from a lady whose husband is a quadriplegic as a result of a car accident. As part of his rehabilitation program, she tries to take him to physiotherapy. But in order to do that, because of the equipment she has to carry, she needs a larger vehicle. She lives in outback New South Wales. There is no public transport so, unless this lady can purchase a bus, there is no way that her husband will be able to leave the home. When she wrote to the Government, she found out that in this situation there is no sales tax exemption on vehicles</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the problem that the Government faces, but I think this matter is something we should look at, because it is a problem. I know that most honourable members here would have struck that problem in their constituencies. I ask the Minister to have a look at it again. I will certainly be taking it up with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I think there is a fairly strong feeling in my electorate at the moment about the urge to change the Australian flag. I do not know whether we are conservative or whether we believe we are nationalistic, but certainly I am one person who always says that perhaps one day in the future the flag will be changed by our children and grandchildren. I hope it is never changed, because I believe in the Australian flag the way it is. I see no reason to change the flag. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I immediately went to the Hewson tax manifesto to see what was involved there. Obligingly, in supplement No. 5, it gives an example of how it affects sporting clubs. I do not have time to go through that entire example here, but it sets out how a soccer club would have to pay a goods and services tax on all the equipment it purchased. It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the club bills its 300 members for annual subscriptions of $100 each, plus 15 per cent GST, making the final subscription $115 per member.</PARA>
<PARA>In the subsequent couple of paragraphs, it sets out other areas in which the GST would apply. The club would, in fact, have to pay GST on the travel cost for teams and officials, equipment, postage, and affiliation fees to parent bodies. Individuals would have to pay a GST on their membership subscriptions, hiring of facilities, purchase of clothing, sportswear and other items. Those things are set out quite clearly in the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when one goes further into it, one finds that the list of those items which are affected by the GST and which will injure the sporting clubs in our country is much more extensive. There is, in fact, to be a GST charge under the Hewson tax manifesto on free equipment and other donations and sponsorships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very interesting article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> a couple of weeks ago, the Opposition spokesperson in this area, Senator Michael Baume, is referred to quite extensively. I quote from that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, Baume says GST will be charged on free equipment supplied by manufacturers as well as on other agreements such as contra-deal sponsorships.</PARA>
<PARA>Many clubs in my electorate rely very heavily on that sort of voluntary donation and support; they are clearly going to be penalised under the GST policies. In fact, according to Senator Baume in this article, even services from non-profit organisations to other non-profit organisations may be subject to the GST. It refers in particular to the drug testing which is performed by voluntary organisations such as the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Senator Baume, so this article says, is not quite sure whether these organisations will be taxed on that and he has referred that to the Opposition's little think-tank that is working its way through these and other problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article goes on to point out quite clearly that the Australian Sports and Drug Agency services provided to groups such as the New South Wales Rugby League organisation would be charged a GST on those medical services. So there is no doubt at all about what will happen in the professional codes of various sports or where any organisation operates on other than a non-profit basis and, at this stage, we are still not sure what the Hewson tax manifesto would do for non-profit organisations sharing their services. </PARA>

Whilst wool selling is conducted using the sale by sample method, there is no compelling reason to centralise wool selling operations. To centralise sales by sample in Melbourne means wool brokers will incur costly transport charges in moving thousands of sample boxes to Melbourne showrooms. Existing wool brokers operate effectively in Geelong using single floor warehousing systems. The National Wool Centre at Geelong successfully combines wool sales with history and tourism. Under the present selling method, the process is efficient if sample boxes are located close to warehousing operations. Also, Melbourne would experience difficulties with continual back-to-back sales as show floor space is limited.</PARA></TALK.START>

All I ask from the honourable member for Hinkler is at least sufficient honesty to concede that this is not an additional tax and that every business input that incurs a GST has that GST rebated to it.

On this occasion we have forecast essentially for an 18-month period, including the 1992-93 period. Beyond that, we have a scenario which is based on a model which was built in the Treasury and has certain assumptions built into it. One of the key assumptions that has been built into it is the one about inflation and wages. That is the one which the Opposition and so many others in the community find hard to accept, apparently. What we have said is that we are basing our growth on the assumption of low inflation growth; that is, inflation which will be at or below the level of our trading partners. How, one might say, can that be achieved? It can be achieved because we have an understanding with the trade union movement on the crucial question of wages.

What those opposite are saying, and what they find so incomprehensible, is that we can contemplate low inflationary growth in this country. What they contemplate is high inflation and probably no growth. Their problem is that they cannot possibly contemplate a situation of low inflationary growth or wage restraint in any possible scenario that they might develop. That is why the growth estimates which they assume are so much lower than ours; that is why their productivity estimates are so much lower than ours.

On top of that, in last night's statement we established a landmark reform with a new regime for depreciation for Australian business, to give Australian business the capacity to write off plant and equipment against assessable income at rates much faster than those at which it was formerly able to be written off. This will mean that a 40-year asset or an asset which was formerly depreciable over 40 years will now be depreciable over 15 years; an asset which was formerly depreciable over 20 years will now be depreciable over 7 1/2 years, and so on.

What those opposite have done is increase the corporate rate they proposed from 39 per cent to 42 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tourism was one of the industries which flourished greatly under the opening up of the economy in the 1980s by the removal of exchange controls, by the float of the exchange rate and by more open foreign investment rules. Those measures saw the Australian tourism industry flourish, so that now we have high quality, world quality tourist accommodation. The importance of tourism has always been underlined by this Government. It is one of the reasons why we believe a consumption tax at a rate of 15 per cent would be entirely deleterious to all tourist accommodation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of its importance, the tourism portfolio has now been included in the Cabinet as a full ministry under the honourable member for Maribyrnong. In the course of this statement he brought to the ad hoc committee of the Cabinet policies which affect the tourism industry beneficially and which we have considered. Other policies not directly related to his portfolio, but affecting it, have also been considered and adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In aviation policy we have put in place the ending of the two-airline policy of the Liberals;  major changes affecting both international air travel and travel within Australia;  the opportunity for additional carriers by the development of infrastructure at airports, with common user terminals being built in Sydney and Melbourne and possibly at other airports and the international airports at Sydney and Melbourne being significantly upgraded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of depreciation on tourist related buildings, the allowance has just about doubled from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. There will be a faster rate of write-off for plant and equipment associated with tourism development and for structures, such as car parks, roads et cetera. We have increased the funds of the Australian Tourist Commission by $15m for additional promotion. Since 1983 we have increased sixfold the funds for tourism promotion, to advertise Australia abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we taking this industry seriously?  It is represented in the Cabinet by a Minister of Cabinet ranking who has brought changes to the Government to make this industry better and more competitive. Because so much of the growth in tourism is employment related with a high labour content and a great capacity to produce many thousands of jobs in the economy, we see that tourism has changed from being an important industry in the 1980s to being one of the economic stars in Australia in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be crippling it with a 15 per cent tax on every room every morning, or 15 per cent on every restaurant meal, or 15 per cent on every service provided at an integrated tourist resort. We will not be crippling the industry. We will give it a chance. We will give it the prospects for growth without the sort of crippling tax impost which has been dreamt up by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for tourism. They must have great difficulty in explaining to members of the tourism industry how the 15 per cent GST impost will help them as it turns their competitiveness down and robs them of the sort of growth to which they are entitled. This Government has taken the opposite view. We have kicked the tourism industry along, and we are very proud of it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government stands by those figures. There has been some discussion about the productivity estimates which underlie the creation of the scenario which has been referred to. I think it is important to bear in mind that what we are talking about in terms of productivity of 1.5 per cent is what the Australian Bureau of Statistics has estimated for multifactor productivity during the period from the late 1960s until the late 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the period immediately ahead we are assuming the same figure as was recorded by the ABS in the period from the late 1960s through to the late 1980s. If anything, that productivity number is likely to be somewhat on the conservative side. It is a fact that as any economy emerges from recession into recovery we are likely to see a pick-up in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the question of growth is concerned&mdash;and that was the other matter to which the honourable member referred&mdash;there are a number of issues here which support the growth figures which are included in the scenario period. The first thing to bear in mind&mdash;and this might be difficult for the Opposition&mdash;is to recall that we are talking about low inflationary growth. In a sense, because one has low inflation one has greater efficiency in the economy and one is therefore able, in a sense, to raise one of the important speed limits&mdash;one of the barriers&mdash;which our economy has always run into in the past as it tried to grow during a period of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, inflationary expectations are now at a very low level and in fact are at about the same level as inflation itself. This is a very important achievement for Australia and one which we must hang on to if we want to see the realisation of stronger periods of growth and, therefore, reductions in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the profit share, as we go into this period of recovery, continues to be strong. That means that there will be greater capacity, as the economy improves, for business to invest and to grow. Lower interest rates are, of course, another factor. The fact that we have been able to bring down interest rates to a low level in Australia again means that this is an important underpinning for a stronger period of growth in the period immediately ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I wish to make refers to the breaking of the drought and, therefore, the better prospects for the farm sector. The fourth point I make is that ABARE&mdash;our official body in terms of advising us on the prices of commodities&mdash;has indicated that there will be an improvement in the terms of trade, as it predicts that commodity prices across the range of the commodities that we export will improve over the period immediately ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point is that when this suggestion is made that we cannot grow faster than our trading partners we should bear in mind that the composition of our trading partners has changed quite dramatically in the last 10 years. We are not now trading to such an extent with the economies which have slowed down so much in Europe and North America; rather, we are trading more with the rapidly growing economies closer to home. Indeed, whilst Japan continues to be the destination for 28 per cent of our merchandise exports, we have seen, essentially, a new Japan grow as a destination for our exports amongst the ASEAN nations and the newly industrialised economies.

Over the last 10 years we have seen that the nations of north-east and South East Asia have become the destination of 30 per cent of our merchandise exports. Those are the economies which continue to grow strongly and, therefore, provide an opportunity&mdash;a growing market&mdash;for so many of our exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that the expectations we have in this scenario are not ambitious, compared with our previous experience as we have emerged into recoveries in the past. If one looks at what happened as we emerged from the recession in the early 1960s, one can see the growth rates were 6.6 per cent, 7 per cent and 7.1 per cent in the first three years of recovery. In the last recovery in the 1980s we saw 6 per cent, 5.1 per cent and 4 per cent. What has been built into this scenario is growth rates in the first three years of 4 3/4 per cent, 4 1/2 per cent and 4 1/4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Opposition's favoured advisers on these matters were saying that the growth which we could anticipate in 1992-93 was 3 3/4 per cent, and that was before the measures that we announced last night, which will have an important additional impact on our growth rates in the forthcoming 18 months or so.</PARA>

This is real and immediate assistance for those lower income families. That has to be put against the fact that this has been an area of total neglect on the part of the Liberal Party. We should remember that the central features of the Liberal Party's tax cuts for the low income earners are only designed to compensate for the savage impact of the food and clothing tax, a tax which these people, mercifully, will not have to contemplate under us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some comments along the lines that the honourable member for Oxley refers to in a more than unusually demented press release from the Opposition spokesman on education matters, in which he describes an undertaking by this Government to increase expenditure on vocational education in this country by $720m over three years as a damp squib. I will get on to what he particularly wants to do about it but this is definitely a novel description of such an initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently it is a damp squib because I have to talk to the States to arrive at agreements with them in order to spend it&mdash;in exactly the same way as we do with secondary education and in exactly the same way as we do with all the supporting programs that advantage the disadvantaged in our community in education. It is as though this is some new, difficult process that we have to go through. What the Opposition spokesman says about the Fightback package is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Fightback! commitments are part of a comprehensive strategy to create an open and flexible training market, and are made in the context where agreement with the States is facilitated by recognition of their financial problems.</PARA>
<PARA>As I remember the Fightback package, recognition of the Opposition's financial problems constituted cutting FAGS by about 5 per cent, or something of that order. That is the sensitive financial thing which is going to make the States warm to whatever it is that those opposite propose but neglect to support what we propose! What the Government is proposing here, of course, revolutionises vocational education in this country in the way that we have revolutionised university education and revolutionised the willingness of our young people to stay on in school and get themselves an education.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If our industry is to prosper it is absolutely essential that this development take place. What does the Fightback package suggest? The Fightback package suggests that over seven years honourable members opposite will make a $500m contribution to vocational education; that is, $75m a year for that period. Their increases are $75m in the first instance and nought from that point. If implemented, that will not even take care of demographic change over the next seven or eight years in that section of the population utilising vocational education. What it actually amounts to is a real reduction in the capacity of TAFE to service that age bracket&mdash;some support for the educational needs of our young people and, even more important than the educational needs of our young people, the prosperity of our industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Fightback package were to be implemented over our proposals, the effect would be thus: in the first year there would be minus $30m available. That is on the best estimates because the Opposition's figuring was done before $100m was put in by us in the course of this year. It is unclear as to whether the estimate includes that amount, but if it does not include that $100m the figure is minus $130m. It moves on to being minus $175m in the second year or minus $275m; then it goes on to be minus $210m or minus $310m, depending on how one does the calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of the implementation of the Fightback package on vocational education was, when it was announced, to see a real reduction in the TAFE effort. If it were pursued subsequently by the Opposition in government, its net effect would be effectively to destroy the chances of vocational education in this country providing the training for our people. The Opposition spokesman on education is comfortable with a sherry before a log fire, chatting with his old university mates after a good dinner in one of the older campuses around this place, but he has never taken seriously, or even marginally understood, what is intended by this Government&mdash;not only intended by this Government but advised to the community in general by it&mdash;in terms of providing training for our people.</PARA>

If you want to do a back of the envelope job there, go for your life. If you expect me in Question Time to get the calculator out and work out what the tax rates are at various income levels, then you are cracking jokes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should bear this in mind: were the Opposition ever, God help us, to become the government of Australia, and it produced Fightback to the Department of Finance and the Treasury, they would take the Opposition's proposals and outlays and they would add on $1,355m&mdash;$365m for the change to Medicare; $349m for the GBE dividends; $261m on public debt interest; and administrative changes of $193m. Both the increased outlays and savings would fall short of the target by $2.6 billion. That is what the Department of Finance would tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Department of the Treasury and the Taxation Office would say that the tax measures would show that you have overstated your revenue by $1.1 billion, assuming no avoidance of the GST, assuming new collections from the black economy, which are speculative, and overstated the GST base. After adjustments are made to all figures on a comparable basis, the unfunded part of the Fightback package is $3.9 billion. So, even with a consumption tax, you could not deliver the tax cuts which we are delivering. You have got a $4 billion hole. This is not our say-so; the Department of Finance and the Treasury say so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that you stand up and talk about a 30 per cent rate. But, to bring the rate down from 38 to 30, it costs around $7 billion to $8 billion. You talk about a 30 per cent rate, but you can deliver only half of that. You cannot even get below about 34 per cent, because 30 per cent costs about $4 billion, which you do not have. So again we will be the only people who can deliver a 30 per cent tax rate to taxpayers on low and medium incomes between $20,000 and $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How dare the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;after this Government has changed, without any cost to low income taxpayers, the tax rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent; increased the tax free threshold; spent large amounts of money on the family allowance supplement for low income families with children, and added another quarter of a billion to it as a result of last night's announcement&mdash;then say, for the paltry compensation payments for the GST, that he is giving something to people earning under $20,000? It takes a lot of gall to put that proposition over, and a lot of gall you have, obviously.</PARA>

It is 39 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the rate of tax on distributed incomes under Messrs Howard and Hewson when they were in office? Answer: 78c in the dollar. What is the answer now? It is 47c, but if they do not distribute it, it is 39c. We have cut it in half. The Government has now approved a depreciation and now, after giving tax reform costing billions over the years, we are going to reduce the medium incomes from 38 per cent to 30 per cent, with no consumption tax. Does it not rankle you? You then have the hide to say it is unfunded when your own things are funded by fiscal drag. When your own things are funded by the impact of inflation on the tax system&mdash;fiscal drag&mdash;you say it is unfunded.

We had some remarks from the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong at a philosophical level which could not have made the differences between the Government and the Opposition clearer than they did. They started off with the Leader of the Opposition, with his back turned as usual, talking about, `I never learned respect at school'. You see, I should never have said in front of Her Majesty the Queen of Australia that Australia was now trading with the Asia-Pacific area. I should never have said that we have independence from Britain and Europe, as Britain joined the Common Market and as Australia trades now 70 to 80 per cent of its imports and exports with the Asia-Pacific area. I should never have made that remark about independence to the Queen of this continent. I should have had more respect. How dare I even reflect modestly on the old links with Britain, on the British bootstraps stuff? Of course we then had a flurry of comment by the honourable member for Bennelong about the 1950s and what a very good period that was&mdash;he said it was a very, very good period, a golden age. That was the period when gross domestic product per head was half what it is now; when commodities occupied 85 per cent of our exports; when telephones were half what they are now; when there were half as many cars per thousand people of population; when pensions were half their real value of today and when 10 children per 1,000 went to university instead of 30 per 1,000. That was the golden age when Australia stagnated. That was the golden age when Australia was injected with a near-lethal dose of fogeyism by the conservative parties opposite, when they put the country into neutral and where we very gently ground to a halt in the nowhere land of the early 1980s, with a dependency on commodities that would not pay for our imports.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of criticisms that have come from the Opposition about the Government's fiscal policy, both before last night&mdash;early this week&mdash;and, of course, following the Prime Minister's statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this week Access Economics said that the Budget was blowing out to $9 billion before this statement, and the Opposition rushed to embrace that. Of course, the publication of figures last night shows that Access Economics&mdash;or should it be `Excess Economics'&mdash;was miles out in its forecast. Our forecast was $6.3 billion&mdash;not $9 billion&mdash;and that $6.3 billion will become $6.8 billion with the measures announced in the Prime Minister's statement, which will take the deficit to less than 2 per cent of GDP&mdash;1.7 per cent&mdash;next year. With the major impact of the measures, we will have an $8 billion deficit but that will still leave us with less than 2 per cent of GDP deficit. Those percentages compare with those in the early 1980s. In 1982-83 it was 2.6 per cent of GDP and in 1983-84 it was 4.1 per cent. So we are looking at percentages of GDP which are far less than those at the time of the previous recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the major criticism of the Government's fiscal policy is that it is unfunded. Those opposite say that the measures announced last night by the Prime Minister are unfunded. They are really saying that they should have been offset by tax increases or by other government expenditure cuts. In effect, this means that they are saying that there should be no fiscal stimulus; that is what they are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have an array of expenditure increases and tax cuts which are offset by other expenditure cuts and tax increases, obviously there is no fiscal stimulus. Those opposite are saying that, in the present economic circumstances, when the recovery is obviously very weak and it is not likely that we will move rapidly into substantial economic growth without some further action being taken by the Government, at the least we should have done nothing; the least thing is that we should have done absolutely nothing in terms of this statement&mdash;no stimulus whatsoever. But it is wrong in the sense that that is his basic position&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly&mdash;Fightback. Do you know what you do with the first year of Fightback? If you had been here last night as Prime Minister announcing your policy, instead of announcing a policy of measures of $2.3 billion to stimulate the economy, Dr Hewson would have been up here announcing a policy to cut expenditure by $3.3 billion&mdash;that is the first year of Fightback. That is what they would do in the current economic circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one group of people&mdash;one group only&mdash;that thinks that what we should really do now, at a time when the economy needs to get moving and when we need to get unemployment down, is slash government expenditure; have a contraction of the economy; and contract demand&mdash;cut demand at a time when demand is weak and there is a great need for an increase in demand&mdash;by $3 billion. You are a bunch of economic lunatics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The even greater absurdity is that in the second year of Fightback&mdash;after you have contracted the economy by $3 billion in year one, when you have the impact of the GST whacking inflation up towards double digit levels again&mdash;what do you do? You ease off on fiscal policy&mdash;in the year in which you impose a big inflationary impact on the economy. What a lunatic fiscal policy it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in those circumstances there would have to be a massive increase in interest rates unless you were going to have that inflation permanently built in. The wages blow-out scenario, much talked about by Dr Murphy as one of the possibilities, would be an absolute certainty without that further contraction of the economy by increasing interest rates very dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition criticises us for having a fiscal policy which is unfunded, in circumstances when they themselves would pursue a policy of no stimulus and, in fact, a contraction of the economy.</PARA>

We will now go through three or four years of deficit. It will be roughly the same amount&mdash;about $18 billion of deficit. We will then move back into a surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are not pursuing a policy which is reckless or structurally impairing the Budget; it is a policy built on the basis of a very strong Budget position before we entered this recession. Those years of substantial Budget surplus enabled us to cut Budget sector debt from 21.6 per cent of GDP to 12 per cent of GDP. So we had substantial debt reduction. We will now go through a period of some increase in the deficit, but we will move back to Budget surplus in a few years time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this matter of public importance today to focus upon the issues which the nation ought to be focusing on as it endures the worst recession for 60 years. As honourable members would be aware, there have been some major statements of government policy brought down in the last few days which are occupying public debate. I met a few of my Labor colleagues around the corridors last night and, I must say, it is no wonder that they were looking so glum and so concerned about their own political future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they listened to 2GB this morning, when a radio poll was conducted on people's attitudes to the statement that we had last night, they would have heard that 79 per cent were opposed to the statement and said that it went nowhere far enough. I suppose that is no wonder. When members of the public got up this morning and turned on their radios or walked out in their pyjamas to get the morning paper they were met with a series of headlines which really told the story about the reactions to the Keating statement landed in our laps last night. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> had the word `gamble' in its headline; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> had `Keating spends, and hopes'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> had the words`votes grab'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had the words `risky play'; the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>`Who's going to pay for it?'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `A nudge, not a kick-start'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, `What about when the bill's due?'; capped off by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> with the headline, `An unashamedly political pitch for votes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The headlines were not a surprise because they reflected the damning commentary of so many independent commentators as they looked at Mr Keating's whiz-bang package to get himself back into the Lodge after the next election. Terry Vine said it pretty well in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, when he stated:</PARA>

<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, under the heading `A nudge, not a kick-start', Ross Gittins stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating says he has a four-year plan to fix the economy. That's rubbish.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the economic statement doesn't add up to much as an economic document. It's real punch is political.</PARA>
<PARA>Stephen Bartholomeusz wrote an article for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> headed `A mish-mash dressed up as a strategy'. Then, even from the people who are his friends, look what Geoffrey Barker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Keating's best and fundamentally decent intentions seemed close to being overwhelmed by his inherent caution.</PARA>
<PARA>Mind you, that did not stop Mr Barker having a shot at the Opposition. He starts with the following incredible claim:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal marks Labor's belated recognition of the problems of middle-income earners, and is more socially equitable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am going to destroy that in a moment. That is simply not true. Then he had the audacity to go on and say that our Fightback package gives the most benefit to higher income earners. That is simply not true. His running stablemate Tim Colebatch said that the Prime Minister basically had the guts to be a populist. That is not bad. Then, in respect of the statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it shrank back from doing something more when it could have.</PARA>
<PARA>Ken Davidson&mdash;`Red Ken' from the Spencer Street Soviet&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the impact of the proposals on the macro-economy (national output, employment and inflation) will be imperceptible.</PARA>
<PARA>He could not even get his mates on side. Michelle, as I say, just described it as `an unashamedly political pitch for votes'. But my award for the most jargon-free, entertaining and incisive comment goes to Terry McCrann of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, who starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating should have been a used car salesman. Last night he gave Australia its first Arfur Daley budget&mdash;extravagant spiel, worn tyres, clapped-out engine, use-by warranty and all.</PARA>

Underneath it says `Juan Nation'&mdash;the banana republic well on its way to fulfilment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we read the statement the first thing that really hits us about it is that this whole sort of mirage, this edifice is just built on quicksand. It will be there one day and literally gone without trace in a few days. That is because all the numbers in this are just plain shonky. It is incredible that the Government of Australia could produce a statement based on such loopy numbers on all the principal economic parameters. It is just pie in the sky. It is just being dreamt up. The Government never said that it is actually Treasury's forecast; no. I bet these figures have all been pumped in out of the Treasurer's office and out of the Prime Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take their estimates of how Australia is going to grow in the next two or three years. Basically what they are saying is that when we get to 1 July he, the architect of the recession, is going to flick a switch and we are going to go from a recession to a boom. That is basically it. If we look at the figures he is projecting, we see we are going to zoom up to nearly 5 per cent GDP growth next year and stay there, and stay at an average of 4.3 per cent. We have not achieved that at any time while these guys have been in. That is nowhere near their average. In fact, their average for GDP growth 1983-84 to 1991-92, making an assumption about the last couple of months, is in fact 3.03 per cent, and they are assuming that they are going to get 4.75 per cent next year and 4.3 per cent as an average over the next three or four years. It is just not going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guarantee the Treasurer will get up and say, `Look, this turnaround is not even as big as the turnaround that we had back in 1982-83'. That is his response. He will get up and give it to us rote. If it were true, if we were miraculously to go into this growth phase that these people are all hoping for to save their political necks, the next assumption they make is that as we grow we do not suck in any imports. Go back to 1982-83. What did we do? Sure, they pumped up the economy. We started sucking in imports and we got a massive debt that went from $23 billion to $133 billion, which is about $8,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. And these blokes want to do it again. Well, it is not going to happen. It is just undeliverable. It is pie in the sky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take, for example, the second of their assumptions, which is a big jump in productivity growth. The average growth rate under these people has been about 0.7 per cent. The current trend is about 0.5 per cent. What do they assume in their numbers to create this magnificent mirage on this quicksand&mdash;1 1/2 per cent, a factor of two. They see a number, double it, whack it in there and tell us, `Don't worry, we are going to have a boom, a recovery'. Well, it is not going to happen, specifically because you are not prepared to take on your trade union mates and see the sort of reforms to the way in which we run our businesses in this country and employee relations to actually capture the potential which we have&mdash;which this country certainly has, but certainly not under you people because you take your orders from people like Bill Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third assumption which I want to knock over, and which is another one of the foundations of this mirage that is sitting on the quicksand, concerns private investment. Private investment this year has dropped by about 6 1/2 to 7 per cent, something of that order. It has actually dropped. These people are projecting that next year, 1992-93 it is going to be 4 per cent and in 1993-94 it is going to be 12 per cent and stay there. It is going backwards at the moment. They have built their house of cards on a projection that we are going to have positive investment, and the latest official statistics from the ABS say that the projections are that investment is going to continue to fall. Well, we just kick away another one of the foundations upon which you people have built this mirage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously we do not oppose everything in the package. It would be great if we could just flick a switch and save Paul's political neck and get everybody back to work. It would be great. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we flick through the pages it stands out that that group in our society, those in greatest need, get a once-off payment if they have children, which affects about 200,000 or 300,000, and the other 3 1/2 million get absolutely nothing. It is extraordinary. Not only do they get nothing, but they pay more tax over the years through bracket creep. You guys who talk about compassion, concern for the disadvantaged in our society, have kicked them in the teeth and now you abandon them, and in the next year, two years, three years, four years, five years you give them absolutely nothing. I think it is an outrage. I think you ought to be ashamed of this package. You carry on about fairness and social justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was supposed to be a debate about mapping out a strategy for the future prosperity of the country, but instead what we had from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) was a fairly shallow attempt to criticise the Government's proposals which were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night. The speech proceeded on the basis of a series of quotations from journalists, who are now referred to as commentators in terms of this economic debate. I suppose the one thing which I lament in the last nine years is that in a sense we taught them all too well. We taught them about the desirability of fiscal restraint. We taught them about the desirability of getting our Budget in shape. We taught them about the desirability, in the context of a period of strong economic growth, to get the Budget back into surplus. We taught them about the virtues of having a low level of debt confronting the central government. We taught them all that over the last nine years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we allowed those commentators to forget a few important lessons. We allowed them to forget that, in the context of a recession, there is an important role for government to play in trying to bring on an economic recovery. Essentially, that is what this debate is all about. It is about whether we want to see the Australian economy continue to languish in a recession&mdash;in the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), a decade of recession&mdash;or whether we want to see a legitimate role for government in trying to bring on a recovery, trying to do something about a more rapid return to prosperity, a more rapid generation of jobs in this country to try to get back to work the 800,000 or 900,000 people who are now looking for work. The commentators, so-called, have forgotten that there is a perfectly legitimate role for government, particularly in the context of our fiscal position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not for nothing go through that period of teaching the Opposition the virtues of fiscal propriety. We did not embrace that objective. We did not go into a period of sustained Budget surplus during the good years just so that we could hang on to it. We did it because we wanted to get the Budget back into shape so that, if ever we needed to use the room that was created by that restructuring of the Budget, we could do so without threatening the structure of the Budget or the indebtedness of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recall that we probably have the lowest level of indebtedness of any country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The average debt level of OECD countries is 60 per cent of gross domestic product. Ours is 16 per cent&mdash;60 per cent versus 16 per cent. Whether it is measured in terms of domestic debt or the Commonwealth's foreign debt, that is a very low level of indebtedness indeed. In other words, we went through the 1980s setting ourselves up so that we could have the budgetary flexibility to do precisely what we are doing today. Yet what do we hear from those opposite?  We hear that we should not do it; in other words, that we should not apply some fiscal stimulus; we should only expend that which we save&mdash;which is a piece of fiscal and economic nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the so-called commentators being too slow to relearn the lessons they got in the 1980s, which were that in these circumstances we can promote the economy from recession to recovery. But I have every confidence that these commentators well understand not only that there is a case for fiscal stimulus now and that we have the opportunity to exercise that fiscal stimulus, but that this particular package of measures is much more, so very much more, than just a question of trying to provide some fiscal stimulus to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say was, essentially, nonsense. That bit of his speech which was of his own originality&mdash;that is, not based on quotations of others&mdash;was nonsense. As he revealed so patently today, he does not have a strategy for Australia. He does not even want to promote Australia into a recovery. He does not believe Australia can grow. He does not believe Australia can grow faster than its trading partners. Even his key adviser, his key economic oracle&mdash;Access Economics&mdash;believes that in 1992-93 Australia can expect to grow out of recession into recovery at a rate of just under 4 per cent. That estimate was made prior to the package of measures announced by the Prime Minister, which was designed quite specifically to promote that level of growth during 1992-93 and then into a more prolonged and sustained period of recovery. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Liberal Party of Australia and, most particularly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, have no belief, no confidence, no faith in Australia. They have no belief, faith or confidence in the Australian people. They do not understand the great changes that have gone on in Australian industry to make Australia a more competitive place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is interesting about the debate that is going on at the moment is that, when industry and the trade unions came to see us, they were not asking for a slowdown in the levels of tariff reduction. Do honourable members opposite know why they were not?  It was because they were adjusting to accommodate those tariff reductions. They were doing the hard work at the level of each individual firm in Australia. At the factory floor level workers and management were getting together, finding new and better ways of doing things in Australia, so that we could become more productive. Those people really need a pat on the back, a bit of encouragement, rather than a constant tirade of abuse and denigration which they receive from the Liberal Party and the Opposition in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party does not believe that that change has occurred and does not believe that Australians have it in them to achieve that kind of change. They want to subject Australia to a continuing recession. As I said yesterday when quoting the Leader of the Opposition, those opposite believe that Australia should be in for a decade of austerity, a decade of recession, a decade during which unemployment would continue to rise. We say, `That is not good enough for the Australian people;  Australia can do better;  Australia can grow at a modest 4 per cent or 4.5 per cent, or maybe a little more;  we can do that because we have now made some of the changes necessary to achieve that'. Most particularly, for the first time ever we have an understanding of what should happen to wages during a period of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of the periods of growth over which the Liberal Party presided and, most particularly, in that period leading up to the 1982-83 recession, what did we see?  We simply saw an explosion in wages, leading to an explosion in inflation, leading to an explosion in the current account deficit. In other words, those opposite could not run a period of sustained growth. They could not do it because they had that big missing link, that big gaping hole in their policy structure&mdash;that total absence of an approach to wages. They did not have an idea about wages. If they did have an idea, they did not have a mechanism with which to achieve it. In 1982-83 we saw an attempt to decentralise the wages system which simply led to an increase in wages of about 18 per cent in one year. It was totally absurd and something about which the government of the day could do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion things are vastly different. We have a trade union movement which understands the primacy of getting jobs. It understands the primacy of developing a manufacturing industry. It understands the primacy of building that manufacturing industry on an export capacity. It is because it understands the primacy of competitiveness that it has decided that wage increases should be conditional upon our maintaining an inflation rate at or below that of our major trading partners. It knows the damage that inflation can do to its industries. It knows the damage that can be done to its jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Opposition have to say about wages policy? It has a policy which is not about constraining inflation, but giving it an almighty kick. Those opposite want to give inflation a kick by introducing a 15 per cent tax on food, on clothing and everything else&mdash;on all the goods and services provided in this country. Whatever might be the arguments of the effect of that on inflation, everyone knows that it will have a very substantial effect on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are saying to the Australian work force, `We are going to increase your cost of living, but don't you ever expect to take that increase in wages. Don't you ever expect to maintain your standard of living through the wages system'. How on earth can working men and women be expected simply to accept that proposition when those opposite do not have a relationship with the trade union movement?  In fact, when they want to embark on a policy and a process of government which will set one Australian against another, which will try to set worker against boss, and which will try to set the rich against the poor, how can they ever expect to have any agreement about anything, let alone something so centrally important as a wages strategy for this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing those opposite can rely on in the end is that as any pressure emerges in the wages system and as workers try to compensate for the impact of the goods and services tax&mdash;or the food and clothing tax&mdash;they will simply hit the workers with an increase in interest rates in order to knock out of the system any pretence or any expectation of a wage increase. That of course is why the Opposition is interested in a no-growth economy: because it cannot have a growth economy in the context of the introduction of a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, on the other hand, have another view. We have the view that Australia is a place that can compete with the world. We have seen the way in which our trade has been switched from a great reliance on Europe and n<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>orth America towards a greater reliance on the burgeoning markets of north and South East Asia. We are saying that, if we want to grow along with them, we have to continue the process of structural change. That is why my colleague the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has a plan to improve road transport. We also have a plan in his portfolio to improve the rail system so that our ports can begin to be not only competitive in themselves but also forced to compete one against each other, because for the first time they will be connected by a rail system that works and operates efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the kinds of things we are doing in order to lower the costs to business and to reinforce a move towards a more competitive Australia&mdash;one which can, with a great deal of confidence, face the rest of the world and compete for its markets. That is the difference between us and those opposite. We believe we can grow and we should grow, not on the basis of an artificial stimulus, but on the basis of rebuilding the infrastructure, which is so important to Australia, and of continuing the process of micro-economic reform, which will have as its great bonus the lifting of the burden of costs from the backs of Australian business, therefore providing for greater profitability, greater growth and a greater number of jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), who put forward this matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's failure to effectively deal with the economic problems facing Australia and to map out a strategy for future prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>As my colleague pointed out earlier, the whole of this One Nation program is built on quicksand. He has elaborated in some detail and I will get to some specifics in a minute. But having listened to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), I think one of the points made by my colleague was spot on. He said that basically the Government is not prepared to take on that privileged group&mdash;its mates in the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was even more disappointing about the Treasurer's contribution was that he failed to read the matter of public importance. In fact, he failed to read the word `failure', which is what it is all about&mdash;the Government's failure. I listened carefully to what he had to say, and I noted that there was one thing that he just could not acknowledge&mdash;the fact that it is the failure of this Government that has led this country into its worst recession in 60 years. The Treasurer could not even front the chamber and admit that his Government had in fact driven us into the worst recession in 60 years. This more than anything else tells us how much duplicity this Government is trying to engage in in wanting to mislead the Australian population not only about its intentions but also about its past failures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting also to listen to the Treasurer make his attack on financial commentators. It seems that he does not like them any more because they will no longer be `nice guys'. It seems that, when all else has failed, he is now lecturing the commentators for actually noticing that the Government is failing. Of course, throughout all of this he completely overlooked the unemployed, those who face bankruptcy and those who face dreadful personal hardship, delivered as a direct result of what this Government has been on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the main thrust of this statement is about one thing: public works. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) no doubt feels very lucky because he will now be overseeing a massive increase in spending on public works. I suppose that if the projects were funded we would say that many of them are very worth while. But with this One Nation program we are really looking at something which is aimed more at saving the neck of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and those of his mates in some of the Labor States than it is at growth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is much more like Whitlam revisited. Do honourable members remember the vision Whitlam had of taking over the railways and all the various things he was going to do? In fact, if one looks at the record one can see it was the Fraser Government that actually had to implement many of the reforms that were needed. It is ironic to compare the capital spending on rail put forward by the Fraser Government with what has been put forward by this Government to date. In the seven years of the Fraser Government&mdash;excluding what went into Australian National Railways&mdash;over $400m was put into railways. How much has the Hawke-Keating Government put in? One would think from all of the rhetoric that it would have to be plenty. But in fact when one looks, what does one find? It is a paltry $33m. In 1988-89 and 1989-90, excluding AN, it was zero. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That comes from the Minister's mates, the ARU. But let us look at Commonwealth government expenditure overall. We can see which government was really interested in capital investment and which one was not. I hold up this document for the chamber. Honourable members really ought to inspect this carefully, because what they will see is that in most of the years of the Fraser Government, capital expenditure either equalled or in most cases exceeded consumption expenditure, whereas this Labor Government, for all of its time in office up till 1990, has presided over a massive excess of consumption spending over capital expenditure. Is it any wonder that so much of our infrastructure is run down? Over those years it has been seriously and deliberately run down by this Government, which has suddenly found that maybe it would like to go on this spending spree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter is more serious than that because we now have to look at whether there has been any serious assessment of the estimates of returns for the money invested. There are already very strong doubts about the commercial viability of some of these rail projects. Has any evaluation been done of the expected social returns from some of these investments? Or is it really more of a pork-barrelling exercise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also very strong doubts about whether the figures will stand up. Have these costs been understated? I will take one example. According to the One Nation statement, it would cost $115m to make the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line standard gauge. Yet the Booz-Allen report of the national freight initiative suggested that it would cost $154m, not $115m. Of course, that did not take into account the Adelaide Hills bypass, which would have been another $185m; presumably that is not included. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Robert Brown" NAMEID="5A5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The Chairman of AN has said that to do just that job would probably cost more like $200m. It is a bit of a difference from $115m. If that example is any indication, we do have to raise very serious questions about some of the other estimates that are put forward in this package. Clearly, if we follow through on that example, some serious work will have to be done just to see whether or not the Government has understated the cost of many of these other projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other things about these projects that are of concern because, as the Minister would know well, there is little point in spending this money without having received full agreement from the unions to get international best work practices. The questions keep rolling in. When will these projects happen? How does the Government expect to deliver them? How long will the agreements last? Who is going to pay for the redundancies? As the Minister would be well aware, the National Rail Corporation has suggested that the number of people employed will be considerably less than the number currently employed on some of these rail routes. With all this additional money being spent, will the National Rail Corporation become commercial and, if so, when? As the Minister would well know, many of the projects that have been announced in this statement have already been identified as marginal projects at best by the National Rail Corporation itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Government's mates in Victoria. We have to ask this question about the Victorian railways: why is something not being done to get some real efficiency there? We have a ludicrous situation in Victoria: the railways alone are losing over $3m a day. One wonders how long the nation has to put up with the losses on the railways. Currently, according to the Industry Commission, they amount to over $4 billion a year. It is easy to say, but it is something like $11m per day&mdash;$450,000 per hour. That is what our railways are losing us. Just in the time that it takes for me to make this speech, the railways will lose more than the annual salary of a backbencher in this chamber. That is a problem that the Government has not addressed. All it wants to do is spend more money, without addressing some of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at some of the things that money is wasted on. As the Minister knows full well, the National Rail Corporation is going to address only 12 per cent of the rail freight, which itself accounts for less than half of the losses of the railways. It is not micro-economic reform: it is a public works program. Last year over $1m worth of goods was stolen from the Indian Pacific train. In Melbourne there are still 40 hand-operated road crossings across the railway lines. We have an extraordinary situation in Victoria in that in the town of Dimboola, when a light globe blows&mdash;and I am sure many of my colleagues would know that Dimboola is west of Horsham&mdash;a phone call to Ararat has to be made to get an electrician to drive to Dimboola: nearly two hours drive just to change a globe. That is the sort of thing that is going on in Victoria. The Minister may laugh, but all of this is costing us dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, despite the Hawke-Keating cutbacks&mdash;and I have already highlighted those very well&mdash;there is another interesting statistic worth looking at. The Industry Commission has estimated that, because of what the States have been investing, rail had its fair share of capital expenditure in the 1980s&mdash;28.2 per cent of the combined road and rail funding. That is interesting. The railways obviously have been given the money; it has often just been misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that there is, no doubt, a failure in this whole package. It has been cobbled together in a great hurry. Not only is there a need for a change of government; this Government has given us this worst recession and deserves to be roundly condemned for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Wannon was talking about public works and funding, he talked about the Fraser Government. He made comparisons between the Fraser Government and this Government. I do not object to that, but he could have gone one step further and said, `That was yesterday and this is what we are going to do tomorrow'. Something I notice about debates in this House is that the one thing Opposition members will not do is talk about tomorrow. They will not tell us what they are going to do tomorrow.

<PARA>How about jobs? How about the extra $720m going to TAFE? How about that monumental change we have made so that the Federal Government will fund TAFE, just as we did with universities? I would have thought that that was significant. I would have thought that anybody who took some notice of what was happening in the Australian economy would regard that as a step forward&mdash;but no, not a mention. Within that sector, we are increasing from $3,000 to $5,000 the incentive for apprentices, to create another 9,000 places this year, so that when we come out of the recession we will have made sure that there are skilled tradesmen for the recovery that will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the reduction in the wholesale sales tax on cars from 20 per cent to 15 per cent would have been considered significant and worth a mention by the honourable member for Wannon, particularly as he comes from Victoria. When speaking about rail, the honourable member told us a lot about the past. What he did not say was that the Government will spend an extra $454m over the next two years to create the main line standard gauge network between Brisbane and Perth. Something that should have been done at foundation has been left to this Federal Government. All the conservative governments in the past, and the one the honourable member spoke about, did absolutely nothing about it. He could also have said that the $603m that we are going to spend on roads may in some way help the Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I indicate our support for the motion that has been moved by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). The most important issue that arises concerning the use of parliamentary records in courts and other tribunals is to ensure that the requirements of the law concerning parliamentary privilege is respected. In particular, there must be no attempt to impeach or question members as to what has taken place in the course of proceedings in parliament. The House relies on the wisdom of judges to ensure that the law is observed in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present application is concerned with the subsidiary question of the House giving leave for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> extracts in question to be produced in the court proceedings. If the House grants the leave sought, this is not to imply that the proceedings can be impeached or questioned in court; rather it is simply to allow the records to be produced for such limited uses as are not contrary to the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights and section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the British House of Commons changed its practice in this regard in October 1980 when it agreed to a resolution to the effect that leave be given on a continuing basis for reference to be made in future court proceedings to the official report of debates and to published evidence of committees; in other words, the House of Commons abandoned the practice of granting leave on a case by case basis. The Senate made a similar decision in 1988 but the House has not, to date, changed its practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that there is some judicial opinion to the effect that as a matter of law leave is not required for the production of parliamentary records for purposes that are consistent with the constraints imposed by article 9 of the Bill of Rights. Be that as it may, the House has not changed its practice and so it is appropriate for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and for the Minister on his behalf, to move a motion, as has been done today. The motion is consistent with our practice in these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Article 9 of the Bill of Rights provides that the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament. This fundamental law became part of our law through the provisions of section 49 of the Constitution. In 1987 it was amplified by the provisions of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. The motion moved on behalf of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is, as has been said, a procedural one. If passed, it will allow records in question to be produced in court for the purposes allowed by article 9 and the 1987 Act. It will thus be possible for a party to establish as a fact, for example, that certain statements were made on certain days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution will not allow the proceedings of the House to be impeached or questioned. I understand that the case giving rise to the motion before the House is at a very preliminary stage and I wish to make no comment on the course it might take. I note, however, that the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights have not always been respected. During the Hope Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies in 1983, I understand that serious concerns were held about a document issued by the Commission foreshadowing lines of questioning. It was concluded by the Presiding Officers that some of the questions would have created a risk that proceedings in parliament would be impeached or questioned before the royal commission. Counsel was engaged to argue the question of privilege on behalf of the presiding officers. Counsel's submissions were successful on this point and the documents were amended so that privilege was not infringed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, in the trials of the late Mr Justice Murphy and Judge Foord, witnesses who had given evidence to Senate select committees were questioned as to their committee evidence. Submissions by counsel representing the President of the Senate were rejected on this occasion, but I acknowledge that this was a complex issue and that opinions still differ as to the questions of privilege that arose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, the Parliament has passed the Parliamentary Privileges Act. This spells out in much more detail what may not be done in courts and other tribunals in so far as parliamentary proceedings are concerned. I understand that a Federal Court decision since the Act was passed gives a very clear decision as to the meaning of section 16 of the Act. One hopes therefore that the risk of proceedings being impeached is now slight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, if the risk of privilege being infringed in any case emerges, the House can be faced with a substantial cost to have its position argued. I think that the Government should consider taking advice on this point as to whether it is possible to attach a condition that the Commonwealth should be indemnified as to all costs. I suppose we could then be criticised as being obstructive in proceedings. Nevertheless, it could be that the Commonwealth will be involved in extra costs because of this, and I think that question should be investigated. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill will amend the child support legislation in a number of respects. The Bill will give effect to the Budget announcement that there will be an administrative review process available to all persons named in child support assessments who seek to depart from an assessment raised by the Registrar of Child Support. The grounds for departure will be the same as currently available in a formal process to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment was also announced in the Budget context relating to a one-time option for a pensioner custodian to opt for the private collection of amounts assessed by the Registrar. This Bill amends the law to allow this option to be exercised. A series of amendments will enhance the powers of the Registrar to recover amounts that are due. The power of garnishee will enable debts due to be recovered directly from persons holding money on behalf of a payer who has an outstanding child support debt in satisfaction of the debt that is owed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A facility is also to be included in the child support legislation which is modelled on a similar provision in the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the Registrar to seek an order from a court to set aside an instrument or disposition which has the effect of defeating a person's capacity to pay child support. These measures have become necessary to ensure that those persons who do not meet their responsibility at law to provide for their children cannot continue to ignore that responsibility. In addition the Bill contains a number of other amendments to the existing legislation designed to enhance the working of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child support scheme has brought about a substantial turnaround in the attitude to, and the payment of, child support for children in single parent families since its inception in June 1988. The outcome has been to see disposable incomes of custodial families increased for the benefit of the children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of the amendments to the legislation I will now outline further assists children in single parent families. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The administrative review process</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will allow a custodian or a liable parent to have an assessment of child support reviewed by an independent person free of charge and without legal representation by a child support review officer who will be employed by the Registrar for that single purpose. The intention is that the parties be able to have an assessment reviewed in the light of their individual circumstances. This review will be a mandatory first step in the general appeal process allowable under the law. It may be exercised at any time during the currency of any assessment which is effective from and after 1 July 1992, but may be based only on the grounds that are presently set out for appeals to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the grounds that are already prescribed exist, it will be possible for a determination to be made by the Registrar departing from the assessment in force in the same fashion as a court can order a departure from an assessment. Further rights of appeal to the court are retained against determinations that may be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of major importance in this amendment is the proposal to allow and encourage the parties, in the course of this mediation and review process, to agree how the amounts of child support, either in the form of periodic or non-periodic amounts, should be paid. It has never been the intention of the assessment process or the scheme itself to limit people agreeing to arrangements for the support of their children. The most satisfactory and unobtrusive way is for the parents to agree to those arrangements themselves with, however, appropriate revenue safeguards in place for custodians who are in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Private collection of maintenance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present it is a mandatory requirement that pensioners register for collection by the Child Support Agency an amount of child support that arises from an administrative assessment. This Bill will end that mandatory requirement and allow a pensioner to choose to have the payments made direct. Pensioners may still choose to register the assessment for collection from the outset if that is their wish. Providing that they report to the Department of Social Security that payments are being made in full under the assessment they may continue to receive the payments due privately and directly. If they report that payments are not being made as required, the Department will then require them, as part of the reasonable action for maintenance guidelines, to register the assessment for collection, and once registered it must remain registered until the liability ceases. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enhancement of the recovery powers of the Registrar</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The methods of collection of amounts due each month to the Registrar are either by deduction at source of income for salary and wage earners or by direct payment to the Registrar from those employees for whom the agency has not been able to identify an employer or all those liable parents who are not employees for the purposes of the taxation laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power to recover amounts of child support that have not been paid to the Registrar when due is presently limited to actions in the court and by intercepting refunds of tax due on assessment under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This Bill will enhance the power to recover overdue amounts by making provision for the Registrar, by notice in writing, to require a person who is holding money on behalf of the person who has a child support related debt to pay so much of the money that is held in satisfaction of the debt that is due. The provision will also provide the scope for the Registrar to require amounts that would, in other circumstances, be deemed to be salary and wages to be garnisheed from time to time to the extent necessary to pay amounts of child support that are due to the Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other occasions when the Registrar must act quickly to ensure an opportunity to collect amounts due is not lost. Very often the Registrar becomes aware of amounts being held for the liable parent by a third person, that a settlement is due in which the liable parent is to receive a cash amount, or of the existence of cash in an account at a financial institution. When all efforts to collect have failed or, in the judgment of the Registrar, it would be appropriate to garnishee funds held, it will be possible to do so administratively without seeking an order of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allied to this change is a complementary change to allow the Registrar to garnishee amounts from funds held in Australia for persons who have a child support debt in Australia who, for the time being, are not in Australia. These measures should result in an improved rate of receipt of child support for the benefit of children where these opportunities are detected. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The other amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Consent orders to be subject to the   scrutiny of the court</PARA>
<PARA>An appeal may be lodged with a court concerning the outcome of an assessment and, after passage of this Bill, against a determination on an administrative assessment made by the Registrar. The present legislation provides that the court must state reasons for making an order which are then required to be entered in the records of the court. This does not apply to orders made by consent and it is therefore possible that pensioners can arrange to depart from an assessment without the new arrangements being subject to the scrutiny of the court. This could undermine the thrust of the legislation in this area. A determination, if any, made by the Registrar will also have to be considered in this way for pensioner custodians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will therefore amend the law to require consent departure orders entered into by pensioners to be subject to the scrutiny of the court as is the case when the court has itself been asked to make an order. Similar amendments are made to other parts of the law to complement this change. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Payments made outside the agency arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions exist to allow the Registrar to take into account payments directly between the parties against the liability to pay the Registrar. This is a popular provision and is much used by clients of the agency, even though it is the cause of problems from time to time. It is a provision which allows, in special circumstances, the payer to support the children directly as the need arises. The provision is limited in scope and this Bill will open up the range of payments that can be brought to account by the Registrar. In particular, payments to third parties from which the custodian and the children receive a benefit will, after the agreement of the parties and if the Registrar is satisfied, become allowable as credits against the liability to the Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enforcement of child support debts when payer is not present in Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child support debts registered with the Agency are debts due to the Commonwealth and this fact has caused difficulty with enforcement in some European countries. They have not been prepared to enforce debts in these circumstances. A minor machinery-type change is made to separate the concepts of who is due to be paid child support and who may receive; that is, collect the amounts that are paid in these cases. The change ensures in law the money is due to the payee, but it is to paid through the Commonwealth acting as agent for the payee. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Setting aside transactions to defeat capacity to pay child support</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A provision exists in the Family Law Act 1975 to enable a court to set aside transactions, whether already made or proposed to be made, the effect of which is to defeat an order of the court in a maintenance matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill inserts a similar provision in the child support legislation to ensure that the Agency can, in any proceedings under the child support legislation before the court or, by separate application to the court, have the court set aside such transactions, the effect of which has been or will be to defeat the payer's capacity to pay child support at all or the amount due under any liability that has been established. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Elections to end a child support liability</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to remove the ability of pensioners to elect to end the liability of the non-custodial parent who is required to pay child support. Because assessment of child support is now mostly an administrative process there is a need to have an administrative method of ending a liability. An example arises where a couple reconciles and it takes no more than an election under the appropriate section in a letter to the Registrar to end the liability. However, pensioners may be unduly influenced by the non-custodian to use this election to simply end their legal liability, or of their own volition pensioners might want to end the liability of the non-custodian so as to maximise their pension entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>The ability to elect to end the liability is to be withdrawn for a pensioner under this section, but in the event that a liability should be properly ended and the custodian is a pensioner, there are separate provisions called terminating events under which the law operates automatically to end the liability in all of the likely circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overlapping provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will eliminate the need for the Agency to have to offset liabilities that arise, one against the other, when there is both an assessment and an order of the court or an agreement for payment of maintenance in force for the same child for the same period. The offsetting process is now believed to be unnecessary and the new provision to be inserted in its place will have the effect of terminating liabilities under any order or agreement if an assessment has been issued for the same child and for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Children subject to a child welfare law</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill extends eligibility for administrative assessment of child support to parents and relatives of  children who are the subject of a child welfare law providing those children are in the care, custody or guardianship of the parent or relative. This amendment will take effect on a State by State basis as each State amends their referral of powers legislation; that is, Commonwealth Powers (Family Law&mdash;Children) Acts. </PARA>

In the ADB, poverty issues are now systematically considered when designing development strategies for member countries. An increasing number of projects and programs is aimed at meeting specific poverty alleviation goals. An example of a successful ADF poverty alleviation project is provided by the `NGO-Microcredit Project' in the Philippines. In the initial phase a loan of $US8m was made available to the rural poor by using NGOs as intermediaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's representatives on the boards of the multilateral development banks are required to examine environmental issues. The Bank is responding to our concerns and other donors on this issue. For projects that have a significant impact on the environment, the ADB releases environmental impact assessment statements at least four months before the project goes before the executive board for consideration. This enables concerned groups to examine the proposals in detail and raise any concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contributions to the ADF are a significant conduit for achieving the objectives of Australia's development cooperation program. About 60 per cent of ADF funds has been committed to projects in Bangladesh and Pakistan, where the average per capita income in 1989 was $US180 and $US360 respectively. Australia's bilateral aid programs in these countries are relatively small in terms of their total development needs. Thus, channelling funds through the ADF is a significant means of achieving the humanitarian objective of providing assistance to the poorest countries. </PARA>

As a consequence, the ADB will be better placed to undertake detailed country economic assessments for its seven Pacific island member states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Papua New Guinea, the ADB is taking a lead agency role in the agricultural, ports, roads and health sectors and the bank is implementing a number of major projects in these sectors. ADB involvement has broadened the base of assistance available to Papua New Guinea, at a time when there has been a reduction in budgetary support under the Australian bilateral development cooperation program.

According to the ADB's latest assessment of the success of its ADF projects, on average, 52 per cent were assessed to be generally successful and 43 per cent were assessed to be partially successful. While these figures are somewhat skewed because they are based on sampling mainly poor projects, bank staff argue that valuable lessons have been learned. The bank is incorporating these lessons of experience in current operations. We will continue to monitor ADB performance in this area very carefully. In my opinion, it is highly desirable that evaluation of projects should be as open and independent as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's Executive Director on the board of the ADB has an important role in encouraging the adoption of better management procedures to improve the administration of the bank. Australia, with strong support from other members, was instrumental in getting the ADB to establish an external tribunal to handle staff grievances. In other administrative changes, the ADB has adopted much more transparent processes in staff selection and promotion procedures. It has also improved its program operations through the preparation of a medium term strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key achievement&mdash;which Australia has supported&mdash;has been to reduce the share of the ADF replenishment that could be allocated to program as opposed to project loans. Program or sector loans are relatively new and there is insufficient evidence at present to assess their long-term success rate. Australia argued that there should be a cap specifically for ADF program loans. A 22.5 per cent limit has now been agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background of increasingly satisfactory performance of the ADB in Asian Pacific development, we have to consider our capacity to contribute in future. We are conscious of financial pressures on the development cooperation budget in general, and in particular on the bilateral programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the last replenishment&mdash;ADF-5&mdash;Australia contributed 7.98 per cent of the total replenishment value. To maintain a 7.98 per cent share of the replenishment would have required a contribution of $431m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the negotiations, several other donors appealed to Australia to maintain its ADF-5 share. We explained to them that the reduction from our last share was necessitated by our difficult economic and budgetary situation, and our wish to maintain flexibility in the aid budget. While a share of 6.5 per cent represents a significant drop in Australia's share from the last replenishment, it is still higher than the 6.1 per cent average of Australia's previous contributions to the ADF, and we remain the second largest regional donor in the fund, after Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike other commitments under the development cooperation program, payments to the concessional arms of the multilateral development banks are made over a period as long as 10 years. We now face a situation where, to fulfil past commitments, the share of the development cooperation program allocated to the multilateral development banks could rise to over 18 per cent in 1994-95. This compares with a share of 8 per cent in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move to limit the growth of the share of ADF in the overall development cooperation budget reflects the need to maintain flexibility in the program, given budgetary constraints on the overall development cooperation budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this Bill is concerned with contributions to the ADF, I have already indicated to the World Bank that our contributions to their concessional lending fund, the International Development Association will be similarly constrained. With a similar approach to reducing Australia's share in IDA, the $350m contribution to ADF-6 could eventually stabilise the multilateral development banks' share of the aid budget at around 12 to 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by outlining briefly the payment arrangements for ADF-6. In accordance with previous practice, payment will be made in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes. The promissory notes will contribute to the ADF-6 lending authority for the period 1992-95. It is expected that the promissory notes will be encashed over a period of eight to 10 years beginning in 1992-93. These funds will be included in the annual development cooperation budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates of drawdowns for ADF-6 are $1.8m per year over the period 1992-93 to 1995-96, $9.6m in 1996-97 and approximately $83m per year in the following four years. These estimates of drawdowns are subject to change, as they are dependent upon exchange rates and the actual rate of disbursements by the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the Asian Development Bank and its Asian Development Fund have an important role to play in continuing to foster economic and social development in the region of immediate interest to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to resume the debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 by moving the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the Bill be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form so that it offers genuine resource security to forest development projects that encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber by:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)minimising duplication of Commonwealth and State administration".</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition parties, after very detailed consideration of the legislation and consultation with all aspects of the industry, believe that the legislation we have before us will not provide genuine resource security and therefore in its present form cannot be supported. Hence the amendment and the appeal once again to the Government to take note of what we are saying, to amend the Bill to take into account those particular concerns that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it very clear to all the participants in this debate, both in parliament and out of parliament, that we have adopted a consistent policy all the way through on this issue, I am going to read a number of statements because I want to make very clear to those who are following this debate our position and the statements of others in relation to this debate. A statement made on 20 December when the Bill was introduced into the Parliament reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition asks Keating to review resource security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Coalition had decided to oppose the Forest Conservation Development Bill that was due to be debated last night in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is seriously concerned that the Bill, as it is currently framed, will not offer genuine resource security to the industry. The Government has repeatedly rejected approaches from industry to amend the Bill on the matters of concern to the Coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that the Bill has been deferred, it is to be hoped the Keating Government will take account of the concerns of industry and the Coalition and be prepared to draft new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will judge any new Bill on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the summer recess the Coalition will continue to work with the industry and the Government in an endeavour to produce a Bill which will facilitate investment in the forest industries, including timber mills, and the construction of world-class pulp mill facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>To further reinforce the point of consistency, I want to read from a joint statement made by my colleague the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), and me. I want to highlight the point that, unlike the Government, we have like views on the question of balance of development and sensible environmental protection. This also follows through into a united view within the shadow Ministry, which of course is in considerable contrast to the Government and the particular Ministers involved on its side of the House, namely, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition suggest alternatives on resource security . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is dated 5 November, so no-one can say that there has not been plenty of notice about our position on this issue. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government should re-examine its whole approach to the resource security issue contained in the Forest Conservation and Development Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an approach which is both fundamentally flawed and which does not satisfy either the forest products industry or conservationists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic flaw is that both the Commonwealth and State are required to assess environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic issues that might arise from a given wood processing project. This involves the Commonwealth in detailed planning in areas where it has no special expertise and creates undesirable and time consuming duplication of approval processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, provisions in the draft legislation released last month allow a range of exceptions which could disturb the security that is supposed to be provided by the Bill. Those provisions effectively provide a charter for virtually unlimited intervention by the Commonwealth at any stage in the life of a project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would, of course, be no need for such a legislative approach if the Hawke government had not destroyed public trust in its decision-making process. It is this lack of faith in the Government that has produced a demand for a legally-enforceable guarantee of resource security to attract investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that no amount of tinkering with the draft Bill is likely to produce an acceptable outcome, the Opposition urges the government to consider alternative approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For very large projects like pulp mills, Commonwealth, environmental and other requirements should be specified at the outset of detailed negotiations between the State concerned and the proponents. Provided those standards are met, the Commonwealth should be prepared to legislate to endorse the State/proponent agreement. This would provide greater certainty that the massive investment required will not be put in jeopardy by the politically opportunistic intervention that has become so much a trademark of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To cover the multiplicity of small projects such as timber mills, which are not helped at all by the present draft legislation, the Commonwealth should be able to give legislative backing to State or regional forest strategies that are drawn up according to Commonwealth-approved procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forest industries have themselves acknowledged the need for detailed planning and assessment to meet proper environmental requirements. It ought to be within the whit of even this government to agree on processes which can be undertaken by State authorities to meet Commonwealth standards without the need for duplicate administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there are Commonwealth decisions, such as under the provisions of the Australian Heritage Commission Act, cooperative action could remove the conflicts of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the five-stage proposal put to the Prime Minister 11 months ago by the National Association of Forest Industries envisaged involvement of the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) to advise the government on conservation values in deciding which parts of a forest area should be reserved and which parts could be designated for multiple use. The current cooperation between the Australian Heritage Commission and State authorities in Western Australia with respect to the South West forests is an encouraging example of what could be achieved elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Bill is an attempt to please everyone which has succeeded in pleasing no one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will reserve final judgment until we see the final form of the legislation. But the government should stop and think again about its approach to an issue which is of vital importance in terms of both the environment and employment creating industry expansion in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make again is that our position has been quite consistent and on the record for quite some time. We offered to work with the Government in that period since 20 December. We have had further detailed discussions with industry and we considered the situation again in the shadow Ministry on Monday and in the joint party meetings on Tuesday of this week and determined that nothing had changed, that the Government had not proposed any amendments or even really had any detailed discussions with us. I will detail later the degree of those discussions that did occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement last night confirmed really the rightness of our approach rather than the current Government legislation. Under `Forest Resources', the Prime Minister's statement of last night reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to facilitating major investment in the forest industry by providing security for industry while at the same time ensuring that environmental standards are not compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a bid to provide greater certainty over resource availability, the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC), working in close association with relevant State Government bodies, has developed a regional approach to identify significant forests for the Register of the national estate. The first of three regional surveys was undertaken in the Southern Forest Region of WA. This culminated in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which provides an agreed basis for the conservation and management of the region's forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of security of access to resources will be greatly assisted by such thorough assessments being carried out prior to considering development proposals either for a region or a major project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.    accordingly, the Commonwealth&mdash;in co-operation with the States&mdash;commits itself to an accelerated and expanded program of joint regional assessments of national estate forest values based on the WA model.</PARA>
<PARA>That is basically a rejection of the legislation that the Government itself has put before this Parliament, saying that the confirmation of an agreed regional plan between the State Government and the industry of that State is the preferred way to go. That is what we have consistently said. That is why we once again have confirmed our position as stated in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do have a tragic situation regarding the forest industry in Australia. It is tragic that we need to be considering any sort of legislation at all. But if one looks at the situation, one sees that there is no development taking place and there is no investment. Potential investment of up to $8m has been claimed, but none of it is occurring. The sawmill industry sector of this great regional industry is actually winding back, or being forced to wind back, whether it is in Victoria, Queensland or particularly now in New South Wales with the threats of standing down thousands of sawmill workers because of the uncertainty of a resource for those people in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an import imbalance of $2 billion. That is, we are importing $2 billion worth of forest products more than we are exporting or, for that matter, are not providing for our own market. Some of those imports are coming from countries which have far lower standards of environmental safeguards than Australia has for its forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria we also have forest material that is not fully utilised. Once the sawlogs are taken from the sections of the forest that are so designated, all of the waste material is basically left to rot on the forest floor. It is not allowed to be used for chips. I know there have been some slight amendments by using the oddly termed e-logs to allow a little more to be used, but there is 1 1/2 million tonnes of material not being utilised, which by itself is basically enough for a pulp mill. Leaving that material there certainly does not help the regeneration of the forest in that area. Because of this stupid attitude, somehow or other woodchips are considered bad. Until enough material builds up to have a pulp mill, obviously it is sensible for woodchips to be not only made but exported. Obviously it is sensible, once the resources can be put together for a mill, to have a mill turn that material into pulp, paper, et cetera, of far greater value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is a great opportunity in this country to develop a mix of native forest and plantation or private forestry for pulp mills. We have the ability, with our eucalypts and some good technology, to produce timber for pulp purposes as fast as or faster than anywhere else in the world. In fact, some of our own technology and varieties of eucalypts are being utilised far more extensively in other countries for pulp and paper manufacture than is happening in Australia because we have no genuine security to induce people to go out and invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the honourable member for Pearce and I were in Kalimantan. Two out of three plantation varieties of trees growing there as part of a huge project in that area of Indonesia to have a number of pulp mills by the turn of the century are from Australia. Of course, Brazil has a huge area of eucalypts. We are now in the farcical situation in which some imports are coming in from Brazil made from Australian eucalypts grown in Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look beyond that to the timber mill section of the industry, we see that there is a desire to invest in value adding, that is, instead of just turning out green framework timber, we would be turning out quality flooring or joinery and so forth. But before that investment takes place it needs the guarantee that the resource will continue to be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is tragic that in this great industry, with the potential for regional employment and for Australia's balance of payments, nothing is happening and it is going the wrong way at the present time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the frustration of the industry and why it will not invest until it has something firm in legislation, something that is far firmer than what the industry has learned to expect, to its bitterness and regret, under Federal and State Labor governments and, I would add, some extreme elements in the conservation movement. But forestry has been cynically used by Federal and State Labor governments for votes. They have been checking out the gallup poll to see which way the balance lies. It has been called the Richardson factor: do not have a policy that is of value to this country or is secure and consistent; have a policy that is determined by the gallup polls, one that will pick up the most votes in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the industry no longer has any trust in the informal agreements by governments, inter-governmental agreements, et cetera, because they have been broken too many times. There is quite a record of them, and I have not got time to go into that detail today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's legislation is the result of that cynical approach to a very important industry and to this continuing battle within the Federal Government between resources on the one hand and environment on the other. The result, of course, is a mess, which is usual in that sort of situation. Honourable members do not have to take my word that the industry will not achieve genuine resource security; let us hear what Senator Peter Walsh, a former senior member of the Government, had to say in his Cassandra column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 November 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More Political Grist for the Pulp Mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the $100 million proposed trigger and its project instead of area focus, the timber industry must be alarmed by at least two specific provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definitions extend (endangered) "species" to "sub-species", further defined to be a "geographically separate population".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can never be too confident about court interpretations of legislation, but common sense suggests this could be used to stop logging in any specific patch of forest with (say) 25 koalas in it, even if there were a million koalas elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If words mean what they say, this seems to permit closing down a project at any time by ministerial fiat. "Resource security" takes on a distinctly Orwellian flavour.</PARA>
<PARA>When one talks about not satisfying anybody, of course, one means it does not satisfy the environmental movement either, for which the Government has bent over so far to try to please. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to that 20 December statement we made, I put on the record that on a number of occasions we did indicate our willingness to the Government to meet with it in mid-January and again later at the agricultural outlook conference. Finally, there was a meeting to take place between myself and the Minister for Resources on 19 February. However, on Thursday, 17 February, the Minister wanted to have a more immediate discussion, so there was a telephone hook-up between him, the honourable member for Pearce and me. I will now read his record of the discussion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upshot of the discussions is that the opposition supports the concept of a legislative level of resource security as a firm foundation for investment in major wood processing projects, however, their concerns with the current Bill are more fundamental than merely the compensation issue. In short, the Opposition believes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)the umbrella legislation should be amended to project specific legislation for major projects only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)the legislation should be tightened up in the sense that once the resource area for projects has been assessed and considered by Government, there should be very limited opportunity for Government to revisit the resource area in the case of unforeseen circumstances. Their view is that the provisions in the Bill are unnecessarily wide allowing the Government of the day to act in a capricious manner should it wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)the compensation provision should be removed from the Bill altogether and wood compensation provided through Commonwealth/State Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)that a legislative level of resource security should be available for programs which draw resource from a common area but importantly, the level of investment does not meet the $100m eligibility criteria provisions of the Bill. Rather, their view is that the Bill should be amended to include investment programs on a regional basis such as areas recently agreed by governments and which have bipartisan support such as the South East Forests, the Tasmanian Forest and Forest Industry Strategy and the CALM/AHC Agreement in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>On the following day there was a further discussion between the Minister's staff and staff from the Opposition, and the honourable member for Pearce and I offered also to set aside the following Monday to have further detailed discussions if that was the wish of the Government. The point I want to make is that we certainly made these offers time and time again to work with the Government to get it to reconsider its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make is that it is up to the Government to make those amendments, and that has been made very clear all the way through. The Opposition does not have the ability to do that with complex legislation drafting necessary for amendments. More importantly, unless the Government itself agrees to amendments, there is no guarantee that amendments will be passed. That point has been made time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in the industry really likes this legislation. I want to quote now from the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd press release of 18 December 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Industry Seeks Changes in Resources Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill requires significant changes if it is to achieve its conservation goals, encourage investment and protect jobs, the Executive Director of the National Association of Forest Industries", Dr Robert Bain, said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The legislation is due back in the House of Representatives tomorrow and we hope that it contains some substantial amendments. The $100m eligibility criterion in the original legislation would split the industry and make the sawmillers and smaller operations second class citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These firms represent some 80,000 jobs spread right across much of rural and provincial Australia. There is no logical reason&mdash;environmental or economic&mdash;for not giving this group the same framework for investment and employment as the large pulp and paper companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"With the current devastation of the rural economy the industry cannot understand the Government's reluctance to support the backbone of so many country communities".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In many cases the smaller firms will be able to invest faster and protect jobs more quickly, because of the long lead times for the $100m plus pulpmill projects", Dr Bain said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The other essential change to the legislation is the removal of the clauses which try to absolve the Government from the consequences of its actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government must be prepared to compensate communities and firms if it decides to close them down. Ideally alternative resources should be found or developed to substitute for forest closures. Financial payments are a last resort", Dr Bain said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Our financial advisers, including a major international banking firm which specialises in forest industry investment, tell us that legislation which specifically rules out compensation is not satisfactory for investment security".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The industry wants these "non compensation" clauses dropped and appropriate arrangements negotiated, when specific proposals are put forward", Dr Bain said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Compensation arrangements relevant for one development might be quite inappropriate in different circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"NAFI recognises that there may be special circumstances that mean that the original legislation could provide a basis for a northern Tasmanian pulpmill. However, our duty is to the industry as a whole, and tens of thousands of employees throughout Australia. Therefore, we could not support legislation which does not provide for the sawmill sector and seeks to absolve Governments from all forms of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very significant release from the industry, coming the day before our shadow Ministry decision. It was a major factor in our decision and it goes somewhat to the core of the argument with regard to North Broken Hill and whether or not this legislation is bankable. Being fair to North Broken Hill, it disputes that it is bankable, but it is also a question of timber mills, and timber mills for the rest of Australia, not just Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that aspect of whether it is only this legislation that will determine whether or not there is such a pulp mill built by North Broken Hill in northern Tasmania, I now quote from a letter dated 25 February from Bill Paisley of North Broken Hill to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to confirm with you this Company's position in relation to Resource Security Legislation and the development of an internationally competitive export pulpmill in northern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, in recent times we have had discussions with members of your staff and with the Honourable Alan Griffiths in relation to these matters, and the following is a summary of the position that we have put to them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.It has always been the contention of North that Resource Security Legislation at a Federal level is a pre-requisite for the assessments needed that would lead to the development of a mill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.In addition to Resource Security Legislation, we have also stated that we believe that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required on the Tasmanian Forests as this work has been comprehensively undertaken over recent years. Following this point we have also stated that all work needed to be completed by the Commonwealth in relation to accrediting studies already undertaken in Tasmania, should be finalised as a matter or urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.For the project to be considered viable it will be necessary that the mill can be depreciated at a rate of 20% per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the above points being satisfactorily completed, and subject to our ability to attract a partner to the project, then North, together with its partner, will be prepared to enter the assessment phase of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the proposed Resource Security Legislation currently before the House, we would urge that this Legislation progress as rapidly as possible as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow the development of this nationally important project.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote that last part also to make the point that I am quoting him fairly. The point I want to make is that even if this legislation is passed, that does not mean that North Broken Hill would build a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, because it would still require this environmental assessment, which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) claims could take up to two years, and a 20 per cent return on its investment as well as obtaining a partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister tried to get North Broken Hill to say that it would build the pulp mill so he could include it in his statement of last night, North Broken Hill quite correctly said&mdash;and this has been freely quoted in the papers&mdash;that it could not give that guarantee because it would not know what the result of that environmental assessment was, and it would not undertake any feasibility studies at this time even though the Prime Minister promised to repay the cost of those feasibility studies if the project did not go ahead. That further makes the point that this legislation does not provide resource security, because it does not stop other elements of the Federal Government bogging things down and making them impossible to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in a reply to Mr Paisley, also of 25 February, made the following points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your press statement of last night calling on the Opposition to support the Forest Conservation and Development Bill currently before the Parliament, even though you have admitted to me that there are a number of quite fundamental problems as drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has consistently stated that the Bill before the Parliament is flawed in that it does not offer genuine resource security and is thus of no value whatsoever to the majority of the forestry industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we remain strongly in support of a northern Tasmanian pulp mill and of resource security. We have said that we will support project-specific resource security legislation to facilitate the mill or legislation to endorse regional forest plans prepared to Commonwealth-approved standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our previous discussion, I made the point that the Opposition is not in a position to force amendment of the current legislation to overcome industry and the Opposition's concerns since the Government controls the House and we would not get the Australia Democrats' support in the Senate. I therefore urged you to seek to persuade the Government to amend the legislation so that it offers real protection of the industry's access to forestry resources. I would be interested to hear what you have done and achieved in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to other points which had been discussed with the industry from time to time. Once again, that would not provide that security. I have another example here of a potential investor from Singapore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want first to expose what I feel is evasion and perhaps duplicity by members of the Opposition on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. They seemed to leave a little chink, a little opening, for themselves to support this legislation when it comes back from the Senate. Secondly, I want to expose an error in a RAC research paper. I want to show that that RAC research paper is wrong on a number of counts. Thirdly, I want to reveal how those errors have been misused by environmental organisations in discussions with the New South Wales Opposition, and I also want to deal with the Opposition's amendment to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition finally opposes this legislation, that is tantamount to duplicity in the formulation of public policy which is clearly in the national interest. I believe that, if it opposes the legislation, its duplicitous behaviour will warrant condemnation by the timber industry. It is well known that the Opposition has repeatedly said that, in relation to resource projects, it would build the Wesley Vale pulp mill in Tasmania. The Opposition has said it would build at Wesley Vale, but it is opposing the very legislation that will enable that pulp mill to be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Opposition:  the legislation does not go far enough. But why is the Opposition doing this?  Why is it prepared to wipe out any possible support through resource security just because it thinks that the legislation ought to be broader?  I think it should be broader, too, but I will vote for it because it gives us a much greater chance of having the Wesley Vale mill. It also gives us a much greater chance of having another pulp mill in Australia. Only a couple of nights ago, a meeting of 900 people from the Eden, Bombala and Nimmitabel areas resolved to work for a pulp mill in the south-eastern region of New South Wales and Victoria by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the Opposition doing this? Is it for short term political gain?  I believe that if the Opposition opposes this legislation it is prepared to forsake the national interest, at least, for short term political gain. The Opposition is prepared to sacrifice at least two possible large developments in Australia for short term political gain. Let me explain why this is so. North Broken Hill, the company which would build the Wesley Vale mill, issued a press statement two days ago urging the Opposition to support the passage of this legislation through the Parliament. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this would be a significant step forward in the advancement of this nationally important project.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, it would be a step forward to build the Wesley Vale mill. North Broken Hill goes on to say that the industry is totally unified and that, if there is to be a pulp mill in Tasmania, both the Government and the Opposition must support the current legislation. So there we have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has read out correspondence from North Broken Hill to the Government. I have to reiterate the point&mdash;I will not quote again from all the material that he has quoted from&mdash;that North Broken Hill has said that both the Government and the Opposition must support the current legislation. Will the Opposition block the legislation so necessary for the Wesley Vale pulp mill to be built for short term political gain, to try to be different from the Government? In so doing, is the Opposition prepared to forsake the national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Opposition is out of step with the industry and with the Australian community. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia quoted the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd. It is great to see the Opposition taking an interest in the timber industry. I have been in this Parliament for nine years. In that nine years the Opposition has made very little in the way of constructive suggestions about the timber industry and its future, but it has been dragged into this debate because we have forestry legislation before us. That is about the only time the Opposition is prepared to raise important forestry issues. In March last year, the National Association of Forest Industries said, `the role of the Federal Opposition in this debate has been a bit ambivalent'&mdash;and it certainly was. NAFI went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has been very quick to castigate the Government for the things it has done to the industry in the past but has been slow in putting their own cards on the table.</PARA>
<PARA>NAFI also said that it had met with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and had numerous discussions with Opposition parliamentarians, and that it was considered most unlikely that the Opposition would oppose the legislation when it was put forward by the Government in this House. I do not know who has it wrong. It is probably the Opposition, because it is now no longer prepared to support the legislation as it is. I agree with some of the Opposition's ideas, but I will certainly support the legislation in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is more. In December last year North Broken Hill, the company intending to build the Wesley Vale mill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to express our appreciation at the considerable effort of the Government in achieving significant progress towards ensuring the future of this vitally important industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, in opposing this legislation the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest. There is more yet. On 23 December last year Australian Paper Manufacturers, the company intending to invest in an $850m expansion of its Maryvale plant, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the involvement of the Federal Government in the concept of resource security and will work with the Victorian and Federal Governments and the National Association of Forest Industries to reach appropriate guarantees through legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Federal Opposition opposes this legislation&mdash;and I am not sure of that yet&mdash;it is prepared to forsake the national interest. The honourable member for Murray has quoted from another letter, dated 25 February from North Broken Hill to the Government. I want to repeat just one paragraph&mdash;the honourable member was good enough to quote the whole letter&mdash;to emphasise the point he made at the end of reading that letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the proposed resource security legislation currently before the House, we would urge that this legislation progress as rapidly as possible as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow development of this nationally important project.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we have the Leader of the Opposition instructing his troops to oppose this legislation. In doing so, he now appears to be opposing the Wesley Vale pulp mill&mdash;the pulp mill he said he would build. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is a conservative opposition, a political party that acts as a mouthpiece for industry in very many ways, opposing investment and employment generating legislation?  Is it because it just wants to look different from Labor?  It is looking for product differentiation at the expense of the national interest, at the expense of a world-scale Wesley Vale pulp mill. I wonder how the new Tasmanian Premier, Ray Groom, feels about having his main election pledge possibly blown out of the water by the Leader of the Opposition. He committed himself to Wesley Vale. Without this legislation there is much less likelihood of a Wesley Vale pulp mill coming about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has had trouble coming to an understanding of the timber industry; it has had trouble in coming to an understanding of the Tasmanian forests; and it has had trouble coming to an understanding of the south-eastern forests. That is a problem because there is such strong rural representation on this side of the House. As has been said, the real debate has been on this side of the House. If the Opposition is not heavily involved throughout, then we have to have the debates in our policy committees. There has been a debate about the forestry industry on this side of the House and that is because we have very strong rural representation. Some of my colleagues who will speak after me will give evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Opposition is a bit like the Labor Opposition in New South Wales in that it does not have people who know the industry. When the New South Wales Labor Party lost people such as John Akister and Jack Hallam and when it hardly had a country member&mdash;it had no country members for a time&mdash;it was obvious that it would be out of touch with the timber industry. Now we find that the New South Wales Opposition has been lobbied heavily by environmental groups which have been using as their basis research paper No. 5 of the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two people, Hamilton and Streeting, wrote that research paper. I realise that it is a research paper prepared for, not by, the RAC. This paper has been used to convince people, including the New South Wales Opposition, that the placement of National Estate areas into a national park would mean a direct loss of only 61 jobs: 50 in the sawmill industry and 11 from the chip-mill industry. It said that there would be a direct loss in sawmill jobs of 40 people. Page 69 of the research paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the model of resource availability suggests that the cessation of logging in the National Estate would reduce the annual availability to industry of sawlogs by 16 000 cubic metres and pulpwood by 29 000 tonnes to the year 2012.</PARA>
<PARA>It then quotes an economic consultant, Diana M.H. Gibbs. Quoting her, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . around 40 sawmill jobs would be lost directly if logging were discontinued in National Estate forests.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the estimated total direct job loss in the Eden area forest industry is 61 jobs, comprising 50 jobs linked directly with the sawmilling industry and 11 jobs linked with Harris-Daishowa's operation.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the woodchip operation. That paper, predicting a loss of a total of 61 jobs, used that report by consultant Diana Gibbs to justify its figures. I have obtained some information from Diana Gibbs which directly criticises and contradicts the quotations from her report which were used by the RAC researchers. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not only is this figure incorrect, but nowhere in the report&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>She continues:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAC report also lists another report, dating back to 1986, as a source of its estimate of chip-mill job loss; but it makes its assessment of contractor and Forestry Commission job losses without providing any basis for that assessment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAC report has been used by the South East Alliance in representations to the New South Wales Opposition. Fortunately, we have an industry and a trade union movement which are prepared to go into the New South Wales Parliament and go before the Independents&mdash;I say this for the benefit of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) who will speak later in the debate&mdash;to correct their view and that of the Opposition. I hope they get their point across, because a lot of misleading information is coming from that research paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAC research paper has made another incorrect remark and I believe this is the basis of its error. It states:</PARA>

That is great, because I believe the sawmill industry ought to have more access. It is true that both the Federal and State governments have a range of legislation and requirements which impinge on the south-eastern forests and, therefore, both are involved in sawmill access.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My own electorate of Forrest illustrates the complexities of the issues before us. It also demonstrates the importance of the timber industry for the future prosperity of the south-west of Western Australia and, indeed, Australia as a whole. Approximately 90 per cent of Western Australia's forest production is from the south-west. This industry pumps between $400m and $500m a year from the region into the economy, employs some 3,000 people directly and provides one in four of the region's manufacturing jobs. In addition, there are many farmers in my electorate who supplement their income by either full time or part time employment in the forest products industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hardwood and softwood sharefarming schemes have been instrumental in many cases in helping to rehabilitate degraded water catchment areas and in keeping the financial wolves from many people's door. The timber industry provides the Government of Western Australia with $35m a year in royalties, plus various charges for power, water, rail services and taxes. The potential for expansion of the timber market, both at home and overseas, is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region has an estimated 1.8 million hectares of hardwood forest, 1.5 million hectares of which is on public forest land. Half a million hectares are preserved for conservation. This leaves one million hectares for multiple use, including timber production. There are 52,000 hectares of publicly owned pine plantations and perhaps 12,000 hectares of private pine plantations. We also have around 12,000 hectares of short rotation eucalypt plantations, half privately and half publicly owned. I understand that there is potential for further plantation investments to the tune of $100m over the next 10 years to establish an extra 100,000 hectares of plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the south-west we already have the potential to produce more than the State-wide demand for forest products. The region can sustain, on current resources, an output of 1.8 million cubic metres of wood, but it can do far better than that. The volume of woodchip exports from Western Australia is almost equivalent to the volume of wood required to furnish our total paper consumption. It is easy to see, therefore, that our biggest imbalance is value. We export low value products and import high value products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years investment in the timber industry has stalled. Growth is at a standstill and the industry has contracted by at least 15 per cent. I am given to understand that the recession may not be totally to blame. Industry sources say that they cannot clearly separate the effect of long term resource insecurity from the general effects of the recession. The fact remains, however, that timber mills have closed and workers have been retrenched or placed on shorter working weeks, while felling and milling operations throughout the region have been cut to the bone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has gone wrong? Why has an industry of such immense importance been allowed to degenerate to a stage where it is begging for survival? The figures I have quoted today are ample proof that in the main the timber industry in Western Australia is being well-managed. It has used foresight in the development of its softwood and eucalypt operations, anticipating the decline in supply of old growth forest and sawlog production from native forest. As a result, the south-west has a sustainable resource that was, until the decline, undergoing careful and reasonable expansion. Our workers are amongst the best to be found, and investors were ready and able to put their money into the growth of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the blame for the recent downturn does not lie with the industry. We should be looking instead at the sorry behaviour of the members of this Government, which pandered to environmental lobby groups to prevent its political demise, while at the same time doing enormous damage to the nation's credibility. This is in spite of a pressing need for new investment in Australia's industries, particularly to help reverse the nation's chronic unemployment situation. Bear in mind that unemployment is already the highest it has been since the war. Over the past year the number of people receiving social security benefits in the south-west, for example, has risen by more than 1,000 and now stands at 4,083 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forest and Conservation Development Bill is the Government's way of trying to convince the community that it now recognises the need to support resource-based industries. In fact, it is a graphic illustration of how not to legislate and how not to govern. In particular, the Government's legislation is too narrow in its scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A resolution unanimously passed at a meeting last year organised by the Forest Protection Society in Bunbury in Western Australia recognised that this Government's draft forest conservation Bill did not remove the threat to existing industry operations, because it applied only to new investments of $100m or more. Put bluntly, my local timber industry wants this Government either to support the timber industry fairly and squarely or to get right out of the way. Offering security only to projects which reach the $100m mark is a cheap attempt to pick the big dollar winners, to the total neglect of smaller operators and the timber industry as a whole. It is quite apparent that this legislation does not even offer proper security for major resource projects. My understanding of the concept of resource security is that it maintains the viability of all operations in the industry, regardless of the size and age of its investment. The Bill before us falls well short of that mark. It is for that reason that we have proposed our amendments to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of Western Australia's largest timber producers, Bunnings Forest Products and Cullity Timbers, recently announced that they were about to launch a joint timber venture in my electorate that would entail a total investment of $50m over the next 10 years. That is a considerable project by any timber industry standard, yet it falls well short of the $100m benchmark. There would be no resource security for them in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complete ineffectiveness of the proposed legislation was amply illustrated by Western Australia's Minister for the Environment. The Minister, who attended the same meeting I have referred to, was emphatic in his belief that very few projects would reach the $100m target. In fact, he raised concerns regarding this legislation at the original State Ministers conference on the issue. Further, he expressed a pessimistic view that he did not think Western Australia would have a major project such as a pulp mill for at least 10 years. The Minister said that Western Australia's 1987 timber strategy was sufficient to protect resources in the State in future years. All Western Australia wanted was Commonwealth legislation which supported the Western Australian timber strategy. Like everybody else involved in the issue, it appears that he has been disappointed. In fact, it appears that he will be completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approval process under this legislation is unwieldy and unmanageable. It is expected that the whole approval process could take up to two years to complete. At a time when Australia needs a fast track approval process for new investment projects, the legislation proposed by the Government is not good enough. This problem is compounded by the fact that two tiers of government are involved in the approval process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the whole approval and monitoring process set out under this legislation casts serious doubts about the extent to which the Federal Government would be prevented from interfering in resource projects for purely political reasons. In other words, this legislation does not offer resource security in the true sense. For example, there is nothing to prevent the Federal Government acting in a political fashion and imposing a range of provisions during the approval process. After all, the Government's legislation provides that the designated Minister must be satisfied that the Commonwealth has completed an appropriate assessment process in regard to the cultural, environmental, heritage, social and economic aspects of each proposed resource project. This leaves plenty of scope for political intervention and unnecessary delays. Even when a project is up and running, there are five reasons why the Government can intervene and, in effect, remove or erode the resource security that has been approved earlier. It is hardly the way to safeguard long term major projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there is real interest at present in investing in the timber industry in Australia and, especially in the case of North Broken Hill, this new investment would be facilitated by the existence of genuine resource security. Unfortunately, the Government's Bill does nothing to foster long term confidence in the industry, and without business confidence new investments will be few and far between. Indeed, the Federal Government has come under fire in recent times because of its failure to attract new business investment. New capital expenditure, for example, plummeted by a massive 7 per cent in the last financial year. The first quarter of 1991-92 saw a further 12.2 percentage point decline compared with the previous 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of business confidence, a heavy-handed tax system, high interest rates and depressed markets have all given our business sector cold feet. Nowhere is this lack of confidence more evident than in the resources sector. Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale and Marandoo have all become synonymous with the State and Federal governments' failure to come to terms with the importance of our resources sector and the damage that such poor decision making can have on the nation's reputation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to talk about the need for more favourable depreciation allowances and sustained lower interest rates to attract large-scale investors. But where is the incentive to spend well in excess of $1 billion on a state-of-the-art pulp mill if there is no certainty that raw materials of the requisite quality and quantity will be available in years to come?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I explained earlier, this legislation will not promote anything more than superficial confidence in our resources sector. Indeed, it could lead to far greater uncertainty. For example, if the Government's legislation were passed through the Parliament, the forestry industry would be entitled to believe that it had cast-iron guarantees of resource security for major investment projects. Imagine the shock waves that would be caused if, despite this so-called resource security legislation being in place, a major investment proposal were rejected in accordance with one of the loopholes I mentioned earlier. Without doubt, the damage to our reputation would be immense and would crucify any perception that Australia was a reliable manager of economic resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, consider the potential for disruption in our forestry industry if a major new $100m-plus project was granted resource security at the expense of existing operators in the industry. With no security under this legislation for those already in the industry, it is not too far-fetched to imagine an opportunist government sacrificing the livelihoods of existing mill operators to ensure an adequate supply of timber resources to a new $100m plus venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of particular concern in my electorate of Forrest, as there have been suggestions that a new pulp mill there may be viable. While I would welcome such a large-scale investment, I would not want to see it take place in a way that would unduly disrupt the existing timber operation. Again, this points to the need for total regional resource security; that is, protecting everyone in the forestry industry, not just a chosen few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of resource security needs a completely fresh approach. To start with, the $100m limit must go. The Government must consider a full range of alternatives to encourage smaller mills to value add and to diversify to assist the entire industry to get back on its feet. Again, the need for improvements in Australia's value adding industries cannot be stressed too strongly. For example, last financial year Australia exported $36.6m worth of wood manufactured products, but we imported $214.2m worth of the same products. We imported nearly six times the value of our exports in this area. We imported a staggering $1,155m worth of paper products. The value of our exports, at $187.7m, was equal to barely 16 per cent of this figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the area of raw timber product, where most people would think we have an overwhelming trade advantage, we actually imported more than 90 per cent of the value of our exports. If the Government is serious about trying to contain the blow-out in Australia's balance of payments and foreign debt, this one industry must be encouraged to value add. This requires solid legislative support from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the non-legislative resource security provided for in this Bill is far too loose and involves a system of agreements between the Commonwealth and the State concerned in each case. Again, it will not provide true resource security for our timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's view is much simpler. Let us get the Commonwealth out of the business of directly interfering in resources issues and leave the broad administration of timber resource management to the States. Let us give firm legislative backing to individual major resource projects, such as pulp mills, so that the companies concerned in each venture can impress their bankers and investors with the extent of resource security available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us not forget the rest of the industry. In fact, the coalition's amendments propose to give legislative backing to endorse the State or regional forestry plans drawn up in accordance with approved Commonwealth guidelines. In this way, the whole industry would know precisely where it stands. It could plan for the future, secure in the knowledge that political interference, which has become a hallmark of the present Government, would be a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently, Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management, CALM, and the Australian Heritage Commission put forward proposals for a comprehensive forestry management plan. While I have concerns about some aspects of the plan concerning areas to be put aside for possible National Estate listing, it must be recognised that all parties concerned now have the opportunity to voice their concerns and make their suggestions before the whole strategy is finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This plan sets out to balance conservation needs with the objective of a strong forestry industry based on sustainable timber production. Already, the process used to arrive at this management strategy proposal is being touted as a model for the forestry industry throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key is that it is not limited to projects of a certain value and does not identify areas of environmental significance on an ad hoc basis; instead, it is a broad plan which identifies conservation priorities regionally. The draft report detailing the whole strategy sums up the advantages of the approach in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment of management of national estate values at a regional level has many advantages. Because the major values and their occurrences are all identified and described in detail, it is possible to identify the particular areas where there is direct conflict between the particular value and a proposed practice, having firstly assessed the representation of the value in the region and its protection in the reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is then possible for CALM to concentrate on conservation of a particular value and on the mitigation of adverse effect on it. In turn, because a regional perspective is available, it is easier for CALM to manage for the conservation of values at a regional level.</PARA>
<PARA>This means that access to resources is not automatically blocked because an area has a particular feature of environmental value. Instead, those features are assessed to determine their overall value within a region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the view that the draft management strategy formulated by CALM should form the basis for genuine resource security. Certainly, this is the approach the coalition has favoured. The only way to secure the future for our existing forestry industry and to encourage investment in new timber projects is to adopt this regional approach. Furthermore, there is no earthly reason why this could not be done in conjunction with project-specific agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I envisage a policy based on long term regional management plans developed by each State in accordance with Commonwealth objectives. These would be cemented into legislation and, where necessary, supplemented by project-specific legislation. In turn, these measures would enable agreements on wood supply for longer terms than has generally been the case to date. In some cases, companies have been expected to operate on the basis of agreements renewed annually, which is hardly likely to inspire long term investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed to the Government's legislation because we do not believe it will promote resource security, and for this reason we have moved our amendment. It is widely acknowledged that, if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was not intent on playing politics with such an important issue, he would openly admit that he was not a supporter of this legislation either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people I have consulted in the forestry industry agree that the Government legislation will not provide long term resource security. Some will be disappointed that the coalition has not supported this Bill in its present form. Politically we could have taken the easy path and supported the Government's Bill, but the Government's legislation is bad legislation and, far from achieving resource security, it could have the opposite effect, particularly for those already operating in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, which always must be of priority, I have grave concerns about this legislation. Indeed, it is quite possible that the existing timber operators could be disadvantaged if the needs of major projects were put ahead of their own.

<PARA>North Broken Hill is pleading with the Opposition to do the decent thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Opposition has a number of concerns with the legislation, so let me detail them, put them aside, and then return to the initial proposition, which is that the Opposition wants to stop a decent pulp mill in Tasmania. As I understand it, there are four concerns from the Opposition: firstly, the legislation should be project specific rather than umbrella in nature; secondly, that the legislation should be tightened up to further limit the opportunity for governments to revisit resource access issues in the case of unforeseen circumstances; thirdly, the compensation provision should be removed from the Bill and wood compensation arrangements provided through intergovernmental agreements; and, fourthly, legislative resource security should be available for regionally based investment programs which do not meet the $100m eligibility threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the first case of project specific or current umbrella legislation. This Bill&mdash;the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991&mdash;is umbrella legislation which will set a consistent and comprehensive framework for considering resource security for all major forest based investment projects. In fact it will act as a trigger to relevant projects and proposals as they are put to us. It avoids the need to have separate legislation for each project; rather the detailed terms and conditions of each project will be contained in separate agreements between the Commonwealth and respective State governments, and these will have the backing of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a practical sense project specific legislation would result in a similar outcome, but, importantly, this would result in additional time delays while legislation was prepared and debated in the Parliament for each new investment project, which we would propose could take up to 12 months in each case. Clearly that is not an option. The Opposition's first objection fails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of unforeseen circumstances, once resource security has been granted to a project the conditions under which resource security could be revisited are strictly defined in this Bill. It can only occur in specified exceptional circumstances, such as the discovery of an endangered species, and the legislation requires all parties to undertake extensive consultations before any decision is made which could affect the availability of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, access to resources would only be withdrawn as a last resort after all other avenues had been exhausted. It is difficult to see how the Opposition could tighten these provisions, short of ruling out unforseen circumstances for the life of each project. Clearly no government could responsibly make such a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect to compensation, the Government believes that there are adequate provisions in the approaches outlined in the Bill to ensure that, even in the unlikely event of resource withdrawal, security of resources available to projects could be maintained. For instance, the catchment area for a project should be defined to include a margin for the protection of environmental values and this would be specified in the agreement between Commonwealth and the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill explicitly rules out liability by the Commonwealth or a State to pay financial compensation, it does not prevent the provision of structural adjustment assistance such as the Government has provided in the past in cases involving World Heritage listings of the forests of south-west Tasmania, the north Queensland rainforests and, closer to my home, the most recent response to the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. There is nothing in the legislation which would preclude a State agreeing to make available alternative resources of equivalent quantity, quality and price in the event of the withdrawal of resources due to unforeseen circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some discussions some weeks ago with NAFI where I debated the question of a letter from the Toronto Dominion Bank to the National Association of Forest Industries. That letter was dated 13 November 1991, and in it that bank stated that the legislation has done little to improve the risks associated with investment in the forest industry and is unlikely to commit funds for forestry investments. I asked NAFI in those discussions weeks ago to give me some proof from other banks who held a similar view because I felt that their view would be considerably strengthened if they could supply information from other banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Minister has had discussions with the Australian Bankers Association, which has advised the Government that it has a different view about lending for forestry investment and that the Australian Bankers Association has no generic policy against lending to the forest industries. So I would argue, and I suspect, that the single document from the Toronto Dominion Bank to NAFI holds no weight in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of regional resource security, the Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concerns to have secure access to forest resources. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector provided it can form an enterprise to meet the eligibility criteria specified in this Bill. In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet that $100m threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements will involve enhanced intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and the relevant States on a regional basis, and are designed to encourage value adding and restructuring in the hardwood sawmilling sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the Bill and the non-legislated policy initiative for the hardwood sawmilling sector are concerned with achieving the following objectives: first, ensuring that forest environment and heritage, and cultural values, are adequately considered in a transparent and predictable framework prior to a development proceeding; secondly, facilitating much needed value adding investments in the forest sector, including commercial plantations; and, thirdly, creating more and better jobs for Australians who earn an honest living from this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provided the forest industries hold to their commitments to invest, as the public is entitled to expect, Australia will benefit from world scale value adding investments before the year 2000&mdash;that is, if the Opposition is sensible enough to allow this legislation through both Houses. The legislation has the capacity to pave the way for a pulp mill proposal in northern Tasmania and for the expansion of an existing mill in Maryvale in Victoria. Other major investments are envisaged for later in the decade in Western Australia and in Gippsland in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular importance is the role of commercial plantations in providing the necessary feed stock to sustain these developments.

Whether or not their investment works because of other failures is their business. Nobody is going to compensate them for that. All this Bill is about is the security over a resource that we can guarantee to the satisfaction of both the investors&mdash;we would argue&mdash;and the conservationists in so far as they too have reason to argue about the security of the wider concept of our forestry resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to rethink their views on this Bill: they are wrong; they are in error, and they are in danger of stopping some of the most important investment in this country in the next couple of years&mdash;a pulp mill in Tasmania, the extension of a mill in Maryvale and some other works later down the track in east Gippsland. If the Opposition wants that sort of paucity of policy making on its head, so be it, but please do not return to the Government and suggest it is beholden to greenies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that out of all this economic damage this nation&mdash;and, hopefully, in the end, this Prime Minister&mdash;has learned something from the worst recession in 60 years. We now know that we must act together to make sure that we do not repeat the same mistakes&mdash;and some very real mistakes, some very tragic mistakes were made in the course of the 1980s that plunged this country into recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must learn in particular what this man has not yet learned&mdash;that governments cannot spend what they do not have. He went into this package on a spending spree unequalled in this country&mdash;a spending spree which shows total disregard for the fact that he is unable to raise the money to pay for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a nation have to turn our back on the quick fix, the political bribe or the attempted short term job creation&mdash;the wild boom-bust mentality of the 1980s. We have to put those sorts of experiences behind us and learn from them as we come to address the basic problems that confront this country. If we do not, we will not have to worry about just the prospects over the next two or three years; we will have to worry about the prospects for our children and our grandchildren. Right now, for the first time in our history, this current generation is about to leave to its children and its grandchildren a lower standard of living than it enjoyed itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the tragedy is that Australia is a very wealthy country and a well located country with an abundance of natural resources, a well educated and articulate work force and an enormous amount of opportunity. What that should tell the Prime Minister is that things do not have to be the way they are at present. We can have a different country and a better kind of country. We can be a major player, for example, in the Asia-Pacific region in the course of this decade if we set about putting our house in order. We can be looked up to by the region, rather than looked down on by the region as we are at present. </PARA>

For some specific examples, we can become the second most important financial centre after Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region and a major exporter of education, medical and legal services. We can develop even a dynamic car industry among the manufacturing industry if we get right the attitude to manufacturing, which is not embodied in this package. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course we can also, finally,  become a centre of excellence in research and development, using the talents of Australians as a backup for that industrial base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I guess we can become a major tourist destination for the region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is only one way to achieve that sort of vision for this country&mdash;and it is not by throwing money at it. It is not by pork-barrelling. It is not by short term dashes for growth. It is by facing the very fundamental fact that this country is not matching the best in the world. It has major inefficiencies, major disadvantages and major cost disadvantages which have to be eliminated in order to turn our circumstances around. There are no quick fixes. There are no easy ways to stimulate the economy to solve the problem. There is just a very hard, difficult, thorough process of structural reform which has been rejected by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The comparison that can be drawn between us and this Government is that the Fightback package that I have brought down does that. The Liberal-National coalition's Fightback package can deliver that sort of vision in this country in the course of this decade if we are prepared to work together to solve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of reasons why this statement fails. But perhaps the principal reason, its single greatest failing, is that there is no mention of structural reform. Hence there will be no sustainable job growth as a result of the statement that was brought down last night. Let me use a few examples just to make the point. Let us look at one of the central features of structural reform in this country that this statement does nothing about, that is, labour market reform. There is a section on labour market reform where those opposite try to neutralise the differences between us and them by referring to enterprise bargaining. They say, `We are going to embrace enterprise bargaining'. That is all we are told. They have been saying that now for several years with no substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about doing something fundamental about some of the other basic problems of our labour market, some of the atrocious work and management practices? Why did those opposite not mention something about penalty rates or leave loadings? Why did they not create the circumstances where there could be direct negotiation between employees and employers at the work place? Why did they not outlaw closed shops? Why did they not outlaw compulsory unionism? Why did they not get rid of the `no ticket, no start' practice? Why did they not get rid of hosts of those other sorts of allowances that we have heard about&mdash;heat allowances, hot weather allowances, cold weather allowances, even dim sim allowances? Why did those opposite not foreshadow some of those fundamental changes, which make us structurally inefficient in terms of our labour market relative to the rest of the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, of course, the statement does nothing fundamentally to reform the tax system. There is a bit of tinkering with the tax system; this is a very strange effort for a Labor Government to hit the poor as a result of the tax changes relative to the rich. But there is no substantial change in the tax system under this Government. In fact, there is a very important group of people, nearly four million Australians&mdash;nearly 50 per cent of taxpayers&mdash;who earn less than about $21,000 a year. Women, farmers, the aged, pensioners, retirees, students, and other beneficiaries make up the four million forgotten people who earn less than $21,000 and who do not get any tax cuts in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no attempt to abolish sales tax; there is no attempt to abolish payroll tax; there is no attempt to abolish petrol excise tax; there is no attempt to abolish lump sum superannuation tax&mdash;there is no genuine taxation reform in this statement. There is no attempt to lower real interest rates; there is no attempt to produce a more competitive situation. Indeed, those opposite risk the possibility that real interest rates will go up as a result of their statement. The exchange rate will further appreciate and this country will go even further into recession. That is the sort of economic risk those opposite have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the waterfront. Does this statement mention reform of the waterfront and some of the notorious practices we have seen over the years? Let us be frank. The Government says it is proud of its waterfront reforms. In September last year, after its much vaunted enterprise agreements were put in place, Australian wharfies earned $47,000 a year for an average of 21 hours per week. In the Port of Sydney, the flagship of reform, idle time&mdash;that is, the time that wharfies either spend going home, playing cards or, if they like the activity, fishing off the wharf&mdash;has increased from 11 per cent to 30 per cent thanks to two years of the waterfront reform process. The Government is going backwards under its so-called waterfront reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take an example where the Government claims to do something&mdash;rail transport. It claims in this package that it will make some headway with rail transport. The Government says that it is going to do this by building a nice, new glossy train line from Brisbane all the way to Perth. It understates the cost of that, by the way, in the package. But the building of a nice, effective railway line from Brisbane to Perth is not going to make much difference if the Government does not do anything about the fundamental inefficiencies in the rail industry. The rail industry has lost about $20 billion in the last 10 years. What is a glossy new train line going to do? Give the industry the chance to lose even more money on the basis of a glossy new rail line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has got to go to the heart of work and management practices if it is going to deal with problems in the railways. I am told, for example, that in Victoria it is cheaper to close down the rail system and give every commuter a small car than it is to try to run the railway. What do those opposite do about those basic inefficiencies? We have seen examples of train stations where, although trains do not stop, as many as 26 people man them. We have seen examples of firemen on electric trains and hosts of other work and management practices which make the railways grossly inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can go to any other area of reform and see no significant improvement, whether the Government has addressed it in the statement or not. Look at telecommunications, for example. In the last 12 months the Government scrapped the two-airline policy, but moved onto a two-telephone policy. There is still one union, but two players in the system. There will be no genuine reform in telecommunications. The Prime Minister, more than anyone else, knows that because he, after all, advocated an outcome different from that being pursued by the Government at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping. For example, New Zealand has imported gypsum from Mexico rather than Australia and sugar from Thailand rather than Australia because of the expense of the trans-Tasman shipping lines. Just last year an Australian farmer sought to send a container of peas from Tasmania to Fremantle. The lowest quote he received was almost twice as high as the quote for taking the same container from Tasmania to either Europe or Japan. They are the sorts of massive inefficiencies that exist in this system. There are work and management practices all over the place that desperately need to be addressed if we are going to turn our circumstances around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about privatisation? The Government says it has started to embrace privatisation. Selling 49 per cent of Qantas is a waste of time. Why not sell 100 per cent of Qantas and put it into place and go on to sell the rest of the Commonwealth Bank? Governments should not be running banks and airlines, particularly the way those opposite have been running them with massive losses, massive debts and massive inefficiencies. This statement is a massive failure. </PARA>

Even the Prime Minister, back in 1977, when talking about the abolition of payroll tax, said that it was a good idea as it could create as many as 200,000 jobs. Why did he not do it? Why does he support a system that taxes employment? We are offering the largest personal income tax cuts in history. We are offering to eliminate the 20 per cent to 50 per cent cost disadvantages that I just referred to that flow into all those infrastructure areas as a result of the massively inefficient work and management practices, the lack of competition, and the other reasons in each of those infrastructure areas that I cited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spell out a coordinated, anti-inflationary strategy. We reduce and eliminate wasteful and unnecessary government expenditure by $10 billion. The only way to give genuine tax reform, as those opposite know, is to cut government expenditure. We have a major program of privatising Commonwealth authorities, a major national savings strategy for both short term savings and superannuation, new programs in education and training that will cost as much as $3 billion over the decade, a new range of initiatives for the unemployed, a new private health insurance tax credit system, new superannuation tax rebates, cuts in short term migration and reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations. We do it all. Those opposite can go through their package and see what they have not done. One of the real tragedies for this Prime Minister is that in the past he has advocated many of the measures to which I just referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there was the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax in 1985. He still has on record the best case for a broad-based goods and services tax. In relation to telecommunications reform, he did not support the two-telephone policy of this Government. He used to believe that Coronation Hill should be mined. He did deals on Coronation Hill in order to get the leadership&mdash;and doublecrossed. He has done deals on immigration cuts, but he has not done anything about that in the package either. He lectured the mining industry about how the resource security legislation was a hopeless piece of legislation. What is he doing? He is pursuing it in the package. There was also the three-mine uranium policy&mdash;and I can go on. This man will say or do anything for short term political support. This document, therefore, fails dramatically as a political exercise on behalf of this man trying to rebuild his credibility with the Australian electorate and trying to develop an effective competitor to Fightback, which it is not. It is a sad and failed alternative approach at the very best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at the economics of the statement. Remember the lectures we have had from this Prime Minister over the last three years when he was Treasurer, and from the ex-Prime Minister, about what our basic problems were in Australia? I was told that one of our basic problems is that we spend too much relative to what we produce. Too much spending, too little saving, too much debt, too little production. What does the Prime Minister's package promise? Even more spending, even less saving, even more debt and little improvement in our productive capacity, if any at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to make this point very clearly for the new Prime Minister, we took the Murphy model&mdash;honourable members will all know Dr Murphy because this Prime Minister has been parading Dr Murphy around as an accepted domestic and international expert for the best part of the last week or so; he came out of the Treasury under this ex-Treasurer&mdash;and ran the Government's package through it; we put the Government's expenditure in it. We said, `We can't believe your forecasts because they are not forecasts; we are told they are projections'. Treasury have disowned them. The Treasury people have put some qualifications in the text to tell us that these are not forecasts, they are projections&mdash;and, by the way, the projections will only come good if a whole host of things happen, which they do not believe are going to happen. They have washed their hands of it. The work was done in the Treasury office and you know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, we ran the package through the Murphy model just to see how the Prime Minister's grand claims stack up&mdash;what he said about inflation, what he said about growth and what he said about the current account deficit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me draw the attention of those opposite to one interesting point, a key devastating demolition point that was made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) about One Nation, the Government's proposals put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night. When the Leader of the Opposition ran them<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS> through the Murphy model he said that they would produce a foreign debt in 1995-96 of $225 billion. That is what we were told. But if we look at Fightback, the foreign debt in scenario C is $245 billion in 1995-96. The Opposition scenario gives a higher foreign debt than the Murphy model does for One Nation. That will do us for starters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the Opposition's demolition point, the central point by which it destroys our proposal, it destroys its own even more by the same point. It is an absurd position to say that something can be run through the Murphy model and then claim anything for that. It is as though it would capture all of the things which are built into our proposals for the future; in particular, the fact that inflation will be kept down by something which the Murphy model simply cannot capture. It works off the past, it works off things going way back; it does not capture the fact that there is now a trade union movement saying that we will agree that wages outcomes shall be conducive to an inflation outcome, which gives us inflation no higher than that of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something we have never had before. It is something which means that if we have that kind of inflation containment built into our wages policy, we are much more likely to be able to have growth with low inflation than was possible in the past. Of course, the accord itself has been a major break with the past and has meant we have been able to get growth with much different inflation outcomes than would have been the case in previous decades. But in the future with this very low inflation, which is less than that of our major trading partners, we have the capacity to maintain that, and the Murphy model can never capture that. So to claim that the Murphy model means we will get less growth or less employment, or whatever, when it does not capture that central point on inflation, is to make the whole analysis utterly ludicrous and irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murphy model, of course, cannot capture things like the change in our export pattern, because we have had dramatic change in our exports. The Leader of the Opposition says we can be a nation which relates to the Asian region, we can be a great leader in the Asian region and we can trade massively with the Asian region. What does he think is happening? What does he think is going on out there? Manufactured exports have been increasing over the last decade in real terms by 10 per cent per annum, and in the last two years by 20 per cent. We have an explosion in manufactured exports. He is standing here saying that nothing is happening; that we are not getting this kind of dramatic change or this structural change. He is saying that there is no structural change in One Nation, but he forgets absolutely that the fundamental structural change, that of low inflation, has now been achieved by us and, I believe, will be maintained through the process that I have just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is a structural change of enormous magnitude. Australia has never been constantly a low inflation country, and we now have that capacity to be a low inflation country&mdash;not with the Opposition's policies, which would give us the GST and push inflation back to double digit levels, but with our policy, which contains wages to a level that ensures that we will have the outcome on inflation which we all want to maintain, not just for one year or two years or three years, but for decades. That can be done with the kind of arrangements which are now in place. That is an enormously important structural change. To say that there is no structural change in this document is just an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Leader of the Opposition made a great point of saying that there is no structural change in things like the waterfront.

He simply has no idea what is going on on the waterfront and in shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just refer to the facts rather than this ludicrous anecdotal evidence that we got from the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that with the reform process that is going on on the waterfront at the present time, major ports have moved completely to enterprise employment and regional ports are introducing new arrangements to eliminate cross-subsidisation. The total work force since the process started in 1989 has downsized by 40 per cent from 8,800 to 5,400, and will be halved by October 1992. Stevedores now report productivity improvements of up to 80 per cent in container handling rates, with some terminals recording average container crane rates rising by 60 per cent from 12 to 20 standard containers per hour. That is a crane rate which is equal to, and in some cases higher than, those in overseas ports with which Australia trades. They are aiming for further improvement to match international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, and most importantly, these productivity improvements are leading to reduced prices for stevedores; that is, stevedoring rates are coming down. They have dropped by 20 to 25 per cent in the case of NTAL in the last 12 months. I have here a letter from David Boyd, the Managing Director of National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, the second largest operator of container terminals in this country. Actually, this is a letter written to Paul Lyneham after he made some comments in a telecast recently. He says in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure you that benefits are being passed on in that new business and contract renewals negotiated in recent months are reflecting reductions in tariffs of an average of 20-25 per cent compared with those for business written in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that new business that is being written is cutting stevedoring rates, because of the enormous productivity improvements which are being attained through enterprise bargaining, by 20 to 25 per cent. I understand from the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) that in some other companies the rates have been cut by 30 per cent. So there are dramatic cuts in stevedoring rates. We are becoming much more efficient on the waterfront, and the absurd statements by the Leader of the Opposition, who is either totally ignorant of what is really going on or trying to mislead the Australian nation, are just incredibly irresponsible statements and are no indication whatever of what is really happening in this country. To use his own language, why does he not tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of rail transport the Leader of the Opposition said there was no improvement, and asked what is the use of a shiny new railway line if the work practices are not changed. The statement in One Nation makes it absolutely clear that there is to be no major injection of funding into the railway system unless we get the greenfield agreement for best practice industrial relations and work practices. Without that, there is not going to be this injection. We will have a very substantial lever on the National Rail Corporation and the unions involved to bring about that kind of improvement in productivity and efficiency. I am very confident in those circumstances that it will be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not just simply throwing money at the problem. We are facing up to the fact that what is needed is a major investment of capital and also a dramatic improvement in work practices and efficiency. Both of those things are being aimed at and will be obtained by this process. It is utterly wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to say that we have ignored the need to improve efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just some examples of the kind of absurdities that we heard from the Leader of the Opposition. He says that because people who earn under $20,700 a year have not got any tax cuts, we do not care about them. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition and to those behind him that no government in our history has put so much effort into looking after people on low incomes as this Government has. For instance, it has introduced the family allowance supplement, which provides very substantial assistance to people who earn under $20,700 a year. Those payments have increased in real terms between March 1983 and September 1991 by 53 per cent for a child under 13 and 123 per cent for teenage children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have increased rent assistance and made it available to low wage families. They can get rent assistance now as well as FAS. These are dramatic improvements in their situation. Not only are they at work with a wage, but also they are getting the family allowance and rent assistance. On incomes below $20,700 a year they can qualify for all of those things. So do not tell us that we do not care about these people. We have focused major direct programs on them. In those circumstances it is just idiocy to declare that because the tax cuts at this stage do not focus on such people, this Government has no concern for them. Of course, in the past the tax cuts have focused on them. The tax cuts have been heavily biased towards lower income earners in the various wage-tax agreements that have been made in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every attempt has been made to look after people on lower incomes in this way, including such programs as child care places with the fee relief system focused on such people. The full cut-off point for Austudy is $20,700. There are dramatic increases in assistance to low income families to enable them to put their children through higher education. There have been major improvements in the real level of pensions and benefits, and the real level of unemployment benefits has increased substantially. Pensions have gone up by 12.9 per cent in real terms while we have been in office and they are now worth over 26 per cent of average weekly earnings. The income for an unemployed married couple with two children living in private rental accommodation has increased by 26 per cent. Single adults are 25 per cent better off, or 53 per cent better off if they are in the private rental market. Do not tell us we do not care about people on lower incomes. There has been every effort made to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, may I say that the fundamental flaw in the Opposition's position is that Opposition members stand up here saying that Fightback has all the answers. Fightback, as I have said, has none of the answers, and nothing proves it more than the point I was making in Question Time, which is that its fiscal policy is fundamentally crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first year, the Opposition aims to contract fiscal policy by $3 billion. In fact, we showed that its funding was wrong and that the $3 billion was only $1.7 billion in the first year. But, if Opposition members were in government now, that is what they would be saying. They would be producing a statement which gave us a $1.7 billion cut, or maybe they would throw in some more expenditure cuts and make it $3 billion. But there would be a large contraction of demand at a time when demand was slack. Of course, that would contract the economy and make the rate of unemployment higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second year, when the GST was introduced, the fiscal policy would be relaxed. Using the correct costings, it would turn around by almost $5 billion&mdash;a $5 billion relaxation in a year in which the Opposition, if in government, would introduce a major inflationary impact. Of course, that would mean that interest rates would have to be jacked up to a very high level or have the inflation level blown through the roof. Either way, the economy would be put into diabolical shape. </PARA>

To get the economy going, we have to give it a kick start with the kind of responsible package which is here, a package which is funded in the sense that it will mean deficits of about $18 billion over four years, compared with a surplus of $18 billion in the previous four years, and going back into structural surplus after that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to focus on the real challenge facing Australia and to respond to the remarks of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), particularly with regard to the hoax the Government is perpetrating on all exporters and to build on the excellent remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) earlier tonight. The challenge facing this nation is to bring about the fundamental requirements necessary to allow all Australians to enjoy the benefits of economic growth and job creation through boosting our export performance and our productivity generally. The need exists to test this statement against that challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his speech commented under the title of `Exporting' that all of the initiatives in the One Nation statement will help build a productive base for Australian exports. He went on to speak of the potential increase in exports to Asia being some $13 billion by 1994. I would like to address this aspect in some detail in relation to Australian agriculture, Australian energy and mining resources and Australian manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to truly boosting our export performance is to ensure a tax structure which will help facilitate exports rather than create a disadvantage for exports and our export performance. In the weeks leading up to the Prime Minister's statement there were some suggestions that the Federal Government at long last would look at the sales tax regime in particular and its impact on exports and export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a paper last year Dr John Bell, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, confirmed that the current sales tax regime perpetrated by this Government creates a 5 per cent disadvantage on all exports. They are not my figures;  they are not the coalition's figures;  they are the figures from a Federal public servant, a senior public servant of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.  Dr Bell said that it is a 5 per cent disadvantage factor on all our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is because $1 billion to $2 billion, around $1.7 billion, of sales tax is descending directly on our export industries as a tax on inputs contributing to the creation of exports. In layman's terms it means that the Australian wheat grower, the Australian briquette exporter, the Australian gold and mineral sands exporter and the Australian forestry machinery exporter who send their products from a place such as Rockhampton to Sumatra face a $5 surcharge on every $100 of exports. That is a 5 per cent uphill tilt of the playing field against the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to declare in absolute terms that there is no such thing as an international level playing field.

The House is entitled to ask:  why did the Prime Minister wimp out on fixing the sales tax slug by removing that slug on Australian exports?  The truth of the matter is that the Government could not devise a scheme which could isolate sales tax on business inputs, which create exports, in a satisfactory way because of the complexities and the implications associated with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>

So there is a $40m hole in that particular project estimate which has been revealed against the Government's own report.

He mentioned the way in which the Opposition will manage industrial relations policies in this country&mdash;something it has never shown itself to be able to do in the past. He said that we have to privatise free enterprise. Anyone who has read the Costigan report will see some very spectacular examples of privatising government enterprises, such as privatising the tax system with the bottom of the harbour scheme. The Liberal Party in opposition, having done nothing in government, voted against the elimination of that scheme. Every Bill to reform the tax system to make people who should pay tax do so was voted against by the Opposition in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition talk about reforming the tax system: restoring the rorts is what they are about&mdash;nothing to do with tax. One of their successful ventures in private enterprise took place in the Perth office of the Attorney-General's Department. One can read about it in the third Costigan report. The person responsible for prosecuting tax dodgers in Western Australia had so much to do that he ran an escort agency out of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's office in Perth!  At the same time, a prosecution notice which had been issued by Bill Hayden in 1975 was found in 1980 in the bottom of a drawer, never serviced. That is how those opposite ran the country.

The National Party says, `Look, if people buy farmers' products we will put the price up so that they won't buy as many.' The Fightback package states clearly that people's income is going to decline; that they will have less money to spend. Honourable members opposite say that, with less money to spend but more being charged for the product of the Australian farmers, the farmers will be better off. They must be joking! But there are benefits. I have just said that there is a benefit of $6,000 for the person who can buy a Mercedes, but the struggling home owner trying to furnish a house will pay more on all those things which do not currently attract tax. </PARA>

Six of those policies put up when those opposite were in government failed. There is another one now and the Leader of the Opposition is saying exactly the same about it as the Opposition's previous leaders and health Ministers said about its health policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is simply another attempt to create an illusion of economic prosperity in Australia while at the same time making a blatant and cynical grab for votes. I think we would agree that that is a sad commentary on the Prime Minister of this country. However, the saddest feature of the statement is that it reinforces the fact that neither the Prime Minister nor any of his advisers understand the true nature of the problems facing Australia. They seem to assume that if we could have better economic numbers all the other problems would automatically be fixed. Clearly, they are wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problems facing Australia are not economic, but cultural and social. In economic terms, Australia is a very wealthy and resource rich country. The Australian people enjoy an affluent and high standard of living. It is a misconception to believe that greater affluence will provide a more enjoyable or wholesome lifestyle for the Australian people. It seems to me that our national planners have a mistaken understanding of human values if they assume that the only objective in life is to accumulate material wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the production of economic resources is essential to meet the physical needs met of people. People must have food, clothing, housing, education and a variety of other physical needs met if they are to live in reasonable dignity. But the mere provision of those physical or material needs will not provide true happiness and satisfaction for human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human beings are more complex than mere physical beings. Each individual harbours emotions, ambitions, ego and a variety of other psychological and spiritual needs. There is very strong evidence that to provide merely for physical needs while ignoring psychological and spiritual needs will lead to frustration and anger, which usually manifests itself in anti-social behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister purports to improve Australia's economic performance, which in itself is a commendable objective. But to ignore all the other values and aspirations of human nature is sheer folly. It seems to me that some politicians have concluded it is good politics to focus on the economy, and their task has been ably assisted by the media, which is more concerned with instant sensationalism than with responsible and balanced reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By ignoring the privileges the Australian people already enjoy and also ignoring the psychological and spiritual needs of human beings, an attempt has been made to convince the Australian people that they are deprived individuals if they do not have as much as someone else has. In other words, the politicians and the media are appealing to the worst aspects of human nature in greed and selfishness in the hope of winning a few votes. Then they seem perplexed because Australian society is becoming more unstable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, greed and selfishness are creating an alarming disproportion between the overprivileged and the underprivileged. Those factors are also causing an increasing number of people to manipulate their affairs to gain personal advantage, regardless of the effect on the community. How often do we hear of people refusing work in order to stay on the dole? How often do we hear of personal affairs being manipulated in order to make welfare claims? How often do we hear of business people or executives manipulating their affairs in order to avoid paying legitimate taxes? How often do we hear of entrepreneurs who use smart alec tactics in order to rip off investors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such events are widely known and talked about in the community and, while they are promoted by greed and selfishness, they are practised with seeming immunity. Is it any wonder that a society that has lost touch with deeper spiritual and human values, but instead has given prominence to the worst aspects of human nature, should have social and cultural problems of alarming proportions?  Do we think more police or harsher laws will reverse the trend of violent crime?  Are we so naive as to think that making drugs illegal will stop people using them?  Do we think that the alarming spread of sexually related diseases will be stopped by better sex education?  Is it assumed that we can achieve higher productivity simply by offering more money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Australia can improve its social, cultural or economic standing, there must be a revolution in thinking. The first profound realisation must be to accept that cultural attitudes and economic outcomes are totally interlinked. We cannot have a stable economy without a stable society, and we cannot have a stable society without a stable economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is a genuine attempt to plan the Australian economy over an extended period. In my view, the Hewson package is the most decisive economic contribution Australia has seen since the Second World War, because it looks beyond the next election and is not primarily aimed at winning votes. However, the Hewson package is limited by the outmoded concept that economic prosperity can be driven by human greed and selfishness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greed and selfishness are at the very heart of our foreign debt, which is central to all other problems facing the economy of this country. During the 1970s and 1980s Australia developed a debt culture. The heavy use of debt was not limited to governments, business tycoons or corporate cowboys; personal debt in the form of credit cards, personal loans, hire purchase, et cetera exploded during the 1970s and 1980s and became the normal method of transacting personal business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is simply not possible for any society to maintain order and stability if it consistently spends more than it earns. As a national society, Australia must either reduce the level of spending or increase the level of earnings. More important, however, is the need for the Australian people to change their aspirations and culture so that we live within our means. We can no longer live with the fantasy that we are entitled to everything that opens and shuts, but that someone else should pay for it. The present recession simply means that reality has caught up with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be successful, future planning must give as much attention to social and cultural values as to economic objectives. Our national plans must also take account of the changing structure of the world and of Australia's role in that changing world. For instance, how can we realistically consider reducing our immigration program while the world's population is exploding? Do we think that all the resources of Australia should be selfishly set aside for 17 million people while the population of India alone increases by more than that number each year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politicians from all sides keep talking about the social scourge of unemployment, which is fair enough, but then they project the impression that they can create jobs for everyone who wants to work. However, if more vision is used it will be admitted that we will never again see so-called full employment. Advanced technology means we can achieve enormous increases in productive output at considerably less cost and by using far fewer people. So we have the combined effect of an exploding world population and sophisticated technology which replaces people in the production of goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted that the production of goods in Australia must be cost competitive with the rest of the world. Therefore we must continue to use the latest cost saving technology. However, the harsh reality that must be incorporated into our national planning is that the more technology we use the less jobs will be available. It is therefore essential that our planning focus on the psychological needs of human beings. If full time work is simply not available for a growing number of Australians, we must plan other means to provide psychological satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that the only way to achieve personal satisfaction and also make a valuable and worthwhile contribution to the community is by being in the paid work force is outdated, and such thinking must change. However, concepts and aspirations in the community will only change when programs and structures are in place to allow individual citizens to make a worthwhile contribution to the community without being in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we provide unemployment benefits as a stopgap measure while people look for jobs. But if the reality is that jobs are not available for an increasing number of people, we must change our thinking about unemployment and also about the means of remunerating people who are not in the paid work force. At present we have a huge unused resource in the form of over 900,000 unemployed people. At the same time, the cost of caring for our rapidly ageing population is becoming a major problem. Surely it is not beyond the wit of mankind to bring the need and the resource together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployed people could be used to provide support services which would allow many older people to live in their own homes and not in institutional care. By doing so, it will give greater dignity to many older people, it will substantially reduce our aged and health care costs and it will give many of our unemployed people a fulfilling role in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite correctly, the major problem confronting this country has been identified as unemployment. But, sadly, the only solution that seems to occupy the media and the politicians is to create full time jobs for everyone who wants to work. In my view, such a solution is a myth that must be left in the past. The challenge facing Australia over the next 10 to 20 years is how to occupy an increasing and more skilled population while the ratio of jobs continues to fall. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Parliament, that we will need a very strong cultural foundation if we hope to maintain a stable society in this country while meeting that challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a package for the times. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said yesterday evening, this statement is very much about making this nation strong. I believe that it behoves every member in this chamber to support the goals outlined in the Keating four-year plan because it is the best chance Australia has of breaking from the economic malaise which has brought in its wake an unacceptable level of unemployment to so many nations, including Australia. We have heard quite a bit about the problems facing George Bush domestically, which I think is indicative of the situation in which we in the Western world have found ourselves; in fact, it is one of the consequences of the boom or bust phenomenon which is the albatross of the system which governs our lifestyle in the west.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we need to seriously question the economic effectiveness, let alone the social equity, of that system where dollars accumulated is rewarded over and above hours worked and which has delivered such results as national debts leading to famine and poverty in the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of colonial rape have been very well documented. I think it is worth considering the system that allowed this rape. It was a system whereby empire building nations with power came and took over vast portions of so-called uncivilised, but actually unwesternised, nations, and I think particularly of the crying heart of Africa and what has happened there. Having taken the resources that they needed for their own use, at the stage when those different states were allowed the privilege to govern for themselves and become independent, they were suddenly thrust without training or preparation into a highly sophisticated world scene, a global trading scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage it was the Western banks, of course, which lent money following the oil shocks in the 1960s, and they lent it without proper precautions regarding pay back. Of course, given the famine, the poverty, the numbers and the lack of infrastructure within those nations, they could not pay it back. So what did we do in the West? It was easy: we just gave them more time. We rescheduled the loans; we allowed the interest to burgeon. The results of that are a major problem in our world today. Where is the sense and where is the decency that allows money to make money and interest to burgeon to an unacceptable level and without a proper ceiling?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the halls of privilege the capitalist system is sacrosanct. One element which retards the ability for people, even in democracies, to effect necessary changes to the system under which they live is the stigmatising of those who question its effectiveness. For instance, it would not stun me at all in some areas, or in some circles, were my criticisms of capitalism to ignite a flurry of comparisons with communism, and of course the Eastern bloc has collapsed because of its deficiencies. I can only hope that the end of the Cold War will diminish the confrontationist attitude which has prevailed from the period of McCarthyism, opening the way for clear-sighted, objective evaluation of the merits and demerits of all socioeconomic and political systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well past time that we did so, so that the very basis of what we are doing is correct and stable. Meanwhile, it behoves democratic governments seeking social justice to work within the parameters of the Westminster system and to adapt policies and strategies to ensure that people who pay the price of economic breakdown are not ground down by unemployment and its attendant social ills. There are many reasons for recession, including changing trading patterns and the resultant loss of markets, which have affected Australia and would have done so whoever had been in government. That is another reality, but for us as a government the bottom line is that people are hurting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background that the economic statement delivered this week is strongly and unashamedly interventionist. While there cannot be one strategy to meet all a nation's diverse needs, as pointed out by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), this statement of necessity focuses on addressing major symptoms of hurt within the community. It has to be done. That means jobs, training, incentives for small business and support for families. It is Labor's plan over the next four years to create 800,000 jobs, without increasing the current account deficit and by keeping inflation down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given incentives to employers to take on more apprentices and there should be an extra 9,000 places this year alone. In addition we have provided help to those employers and apprentices already in the system to stay on. The unemployed will receive an additional $100m between now and June next year in wages subsidies for 44,000 extra long term unemployed under the Jobstart program. Another $30m will go to provide six months work experience for those who are eligible for the Jobskills program. We will take over the funding of the TAFE system to the tune of $720m extra over the next three years. This will enable our young people in particular to acquire skills that will help them with jobs in the future. The jobs will be there, even given the problems acknowledged and outlined in this chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall the Western system is not workable and effective, but with that background we have to work with enthusiasm and in a thoughtful manner to provide within our framework of government measures that will meet both short term need and lead to longer term restructuring so the Government is building railways, upgrading roads, implementing workplace reforms and still finds it important to deliver tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland tourism is an important source of jobs. Between 12 and 16 per cent of all jobs created in Australia in the 1990s will be in the tourism industry. That is about 200,000 jobs. The Government has recognised the potential of tourism for economic growth, job creation and increased prosperity by giving it a kick-start through this Keating plan. The growth in tourism will be achieved in four major areas: increased funding for overseas markets and promotion, $5m extra in this current financial year and a further $10m in 1992-93; sweeping reforms to the aviation industry that will result in cheaper air fares and more flexible travel arrangements; the introduction of a more competitive taxation regime for the tourism industry, which has been designed to encourage infrastructure development, while increased funding for tourism development will occur through the Department of Tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the crux of the package to stimulate the economy, providing jobs and services, is the huge infrastructure program which will revolutionise the travel habits of Australia, bringing us into the twenty-first century. The package is a credit to its authors and to the Ministers involved and I think it is appropriate on behalf of many backbench members and their constituents to pay tribute to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who has been involved in major changes to land transport since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland, my home State, will benefit from these changes, both in revolutionising and in facilitating easier travel for more people and in promoting road safety and creating jobs in the actual construction and in the infrastructure that will result as we are linked to new areas. Queensland motorists and travellers from southern States will travel more safely due to two major initiatives in the Labor Government's economic statement announced by the Prime Minister yesterday. The highway to Cairns will be upgraded at a cost of $43.4m and the highway from Brisbane through Sydney to Melbourne&mdash;the Newell Highway&mdash;the Port of Brisbane link, other national roads in Queensland and the $10.2m black spot program will make road travel safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, approximately $200.2m will be allocated to roads that will directly affect motoring Australians wanting to take advantage of the sun and the unique hospitality of Queensland. By upgrading the railway system in Queensland to a standard gauge linking Cairns with Perth, more people will decide that travelling by rail is a viable and relaxing alternative, particularly for the growing senior members of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail is a popular way of really seeing the vast and beautiful expanses of Australia while enjoying a motel style living. However, rail is not only used for recreational travel; a fast and efficient rail service means our primary producers and manufacturers can more effectively and competitively move their produce from one area to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these measures will provide safe travel throughout Australia. Road authorities agree that the condition of this nation's roads is one of the factors affecting road safety, although the human factor is always there. In particular, the special allocation of $25m this financial year and a further $45m in 1992-93 to the black spot program is welcome. This money will be spent on known crash sites and hopefully will prevent further horrific accidents such as those we have seen in recent times in which dozens of coach passengers have lost their lives. I welcome that particular initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures to assist families, built as they are on a number of reforms such as upgrading child endowment, the family allowance and the addition of the family allowance supplement with cash payments for the first time in Australia's history will ensure that the families in the greatest need will not be harmed to the extent that they cannot enjoy decent week-to-week living. All these reforms are welcome. The cash payout in April, which some people have criticised as being small, is not small to a number of people who need shoes for their kids and other items and have no cash to hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this statement is not a blueprint for meeting the variety of needs reflected in annual Budget allocations. However, it is a blueprint for economic recovery and a measure that will stimulate jobs. It is a recognition that the success of our social justice policies relies on a stable income, and that when people are out of work and struggling to balance their domestic budgets, it is a social injustice that cannot wait for the accomplishment of long term restructuring, essential as that may be; those people must be assisted now and with this package I believe they will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unfunded package from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was designed to make amends for great neglect of the Australian economy over the last few years. This misdesign of our economy has lasted for at least five to six years during which time, as we all know, commercial interest rates at 19 to 20 per cent&mdash;in fact over the five years leading up to 1991&mdash;have broken hundreds of thousands of Australians and hundreds of thousands of Australian businesses and business men and women, put them out of town or under water and, consequently, put many Australians out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this package was threefold: first of all, to establish the new Prime Minister; secondly, to respond to Fightback; and, thirdly, to address the parlous circumstances of the economy. Honourable members can take those items in whichever order. I am sure that concerned backbenchers in the Australian Labor Party would reverse that order. I am equally sure that the Prime Minister did it in the order that I have just spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that we had to have our fourth economic statement in a year? There was a time when two was the exception; one was the norm and two was the exception. Perhaps it is because we have had two Prime Ministers and four Treasurers. Nevertheless, we had a statement on 12 March and a Budget last year, a jobs statement and now this ruination statement. It is because this nation was first into the recession. It did not lead the world, but it was first into the recession, which is now all around this globe. It is also because it is built on the back of bad government and massive debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be churlish of me not to agree that some of the measures in this statement are positive. Accelerated depreciation measures, infrastructure changes, road spending, rail spending, aviation changes&mdash;though not far enough&mdash;and the `stolen straight from the Fightback package electricity grid' are all positive measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, however, that if, for example, the Government had addressed the inefficiency on the railroads; if, for example, the Government had managed to produce half as inefficient a railroad as we have in this country today by one means or another; the Government could nearly have funded the first 18 months of its package. But, obviously, that is not the objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a good look at the figures in this package and we note that, of course, depreciation builds up over the years. We will give the Government the benefit of the doubt because in its very best year, the 1995-96 year, when it would take from business less than it does currently, its tax measures, dollars to business forgone, would total $900m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to compare the Government's figures with ours in such a year. I will start with payroll tax. Let us not forget that this is the Government's biggest year. I have left out the forgoing of customs duties, which are diminishing over time, because in that year revenue forgone in both of our circumstances would be about the same. The Government in that year would forgo nothing in payroll tax. The States forgo none; therefore the Government would not compensate the States. But we would forgo $5.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax on passenger vehicles is down to 15 per cent. We are assuming that business uses a little over half of the motor cars in that category, so we will calculate $150m under the Government's package in that year, 1995-96. With wholesale sales tax on business, on last year's figures, out of $9.3 billion, we would forgo about $7 billion&mdash;if those figures were to go forward; goodness knows, by the year 1995-96 it might be more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On fuel excise the Government would forgo not a cent. We would forgo about $3.6 billion on a figure of $6.6 billion last year. Under the Keating package, the figure would be $10m from the capital gains tax exemption increase, whereas we would forgo $200m under the improved capital gains tax roll-over provisions. The figures for the coal export levy would be the same in both cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Government's package the figure for accelerated depreciation would be $490m; accelerated write-off for income producing buildings, $30m; infrastructure bonds, $100m; development allowance for large projects, $70m; and pool development funds, $5m. As I have said, I have left out customs duties because they are the same in both cases. That makes a total of roughly $900m under the Government's package and in our case a total approaching $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the measure of the difference. We have had comments by some that we will have a contraction in the economy in our first year. What we ought to do is to add up all of those measures that the Government is forgoing, and the stimulus, if you like, to the economy. In the whole of the life of the Government's package those measures that I have just read out will amount to $2.7 billion. I am then going to add in the infrastructure measures, which come to another $1.1 billion. So let us say that it will be $3.8 billion in the whole of the life of the package from 27 February 1992 to the end of the financial year 1995-96. That is adding it all together, cumulatively&mdash;budgetary assistance, all the tax measures and all the infrastructure spending. It comes to $3.8 billion: big deal!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were in power for that period of time with our goods and services tax and the tax measures started a year earlier than otherwise, we could compare that $3.8 billion with tax revenue forgone by business of $60 billion. We can call it $55 billion, if you like, but it is three years of nearly $20 billion forgone in each year&mdash;and that is without including the cumulative effects of reducing that greater amount of tax. That is the way we can compare like with like. Were this country fortunate enough to have a change in government, we would start those tax reductions a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has said that we would contract this economy. He has based this on the fact that he seems to think that the only stimulus with which one can provide an economy when one is in government is fiscal stimulus; it has to come from the font of all power. But let us just take the example of a major textile company that has given us its figures under the Fightback package. It would get back&mdash;or we would forgo, if you like&mdash;$1.25m of payroll tax. Surely that would be a stimulus to that company. There has to be a stimulus. What else could it be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a major construction company in New South Wales which pays $11.5m in payroll tax. It tells us that it would be a marvellous stimulation for it. It would stop that company having to make some rearrangements about jobs that it is making at present. It tells us that the $8.8m on fuel excise that it would not be paying&mdash;that is the direct cost of fuel excise; it cannot calculate the indirect benefits of all the contractors and other people&mdash;would be a marvellous stimulus. The $3.2m in wholesale sales tax that it would not be paying would also be a magnificent stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest savings on the abolition of those taxes amount to another $2.1m. That company's total savings, therefore, will be $25.6m. Getting rid of the burden of that tax of $25.6m has to be an enormous stimulus to it. So it is not true, as the Minister says, and seemed to imply both on a radio station program today and in answer to a question, that the stimulus has to come from the benevolence of the Government. Stimulus can come just as easily&mdash;in fact, much more easily because one does not have government departments interfering with it and creating unnecessary jobs&mdash;from revenue forgone to the Government that is left in the hands of business. I would have thought that that national economic stimulus was exactly the sort of stimulus that we need in this country rather than having everything designed by the hand of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That essentially is the difference between the Government on the one hand and the coalition on the other. What we wish to do in this country is allow people the right to make their own decisions, not to have their hands held by the all-powerful Government. This runs all the way through the economy, all the way through the work and the labour force. We want people on both sides to become responsible for their own decisions in the workplace with all the people involved. We want them to become responsible for their own decisions in education, in health and in business. We do not want&mdash;as those opposite seem to think is a necessity&mdash;a situation in which government takes all the money away and then dispenses the largess. I have absolutely no doubt that it makes government feel good, and when a polyglot of measures is put around, such as the Prime Minister has done in this package, those opposite can go out and say, `Look what we have given you and what we have given you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I came to this place, I always thought it an odd thing that people in government talked about the cost to government, the cost to the nation, when revenue was talked about as being forgone. It is not a cost; it is a benefit. It is an efficiency if one can dispense the services that are absolutely necessary in this country without having to interpose between the collection of those services a whole department of people to interfere with them. What we can have, and must have, is national economic stimulus which can come, and will come, from taxation forgone, not only at the rate of $20 billion a year from business but from private citizens&mdash;which will be a great part of the stimulation of the Fightback package. It will come not only from taxation forgone on the business side of fuel consumption but also, in a land as big as North America, with the distances and the remoteness but without the population, without the infrastructure, from taxation forgone from an excise on fuel. The Government takes it and then gives it back, and it calls that industry policy. We do not take it; what we want to do is to let the self-starters start and then provide the national economic stimulus for them to self-start Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night represented a plan, a four-year strategy for this nation. It represented a strategy for recovery, a strategy to generate economic growth, and a strategy to ensure that the difficulties of the recession are put behind us and the nation has the confidence to go forward into the 1990s with a forward looking, visionary package that ensures our future both in this part of the world and, indeed, as an internationally competitive nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In listening to the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), one is clearly able to draw the distinction between the policies of the Opposition and those of the Government. Since February 1990 we have progressively cut interest rates by half. According to the ideology espoused by the honourable member for Barker, he would leave the situation to business because it would generate its own recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have established clearly in the last 18 months that the worldwide recession is deeper and the structural problems are more difficult than in the past. It needs more than just the wishful thinking approach that the Opposition's strategy would suggest; it needs the sort of partnership approach that the Government has generated in the One Nation strategy. What gets the Opposition's goat in this discussion is the fact that the Prime Minister, on assuming the position, decided to go out and consult the community at large&mdash;the business community, the trade union movement, the broader community organisations, and the State governments&mdash;to develop a strategy and structure so that each player in the partnership could participate fully as an equal partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package introduced last night goes very clearly to the heart of those issues. It recognises that business has needs and that government can play a part in working with it. It recognises that the trade union movement has a very important place in economic recovery, something that the Opposition's Fightback strategy completely ignores and suggests does not exist. Indeed, if those opposite had their way, trade unions would not be allowed to exist. The package also recognises the fact that, with different State governments and manufacturing and structural change going on in particular regions, governments have to be responsive to help get the setting right so that recovery in those areas can take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is what the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister last night is all about. It is about generating that activity and confidence. In all the discussions that members of parliament have with people in the community&mdash;and my electorate would not be much different from most others&mdash;people say to me, `It needs the Government to show us direction and leadership, to give us the confidence'. It is not just a case of saying to business, `You go and do it'; the Government needs to help create the environment for that to take place. That is what last night's statement is all about. It is about setting that strategy in place, about recognising that we can make ourselves more competitive. It is about recognising that we can have a real anti-inflation strategy, something that the Fightback package does not have and cannot have. If the wages element is left out, one cannot simply expect the inflation strategy to work on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly cannot assume anything other than that, with a 15 per cent consumption tax, there will automatically be a doubling of the inflation rate, and there is no effective strategy to deal with that. On the contrary, the Government's policy has ensured that we have a low inflation rate; that we have the base to build on to create the recovery and to sustain low inflation, and to ensure that our wages outcomes are linked to that low inflation rate. The Government, with its partnership with the trade union movement, has the capacity to ensure that that takes place. It is something that the Opposition could never hope to deliver and cannot deliver. The Opposition suggests that it is not important. We saw the way those opposite operated when they were in government, when they did not have a wages strategy, and we saw the results of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement is also about ensuring that we create jobs and that we recognise the real issues in Australia&mdash;that we recognise the inadequate infrastructure we have. It is interesting that Opposition speakers from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) down have all said, `Yes, there are some things in the statement that we think are all right in the infrastructure area'. But they say, `That is all unfunded'. To adopt their strategy, they would basically have to say, `We would cut back on all those things'. That is the approach they have. They do not believe in effective rail systems such as will be developed through the One Nation strategy. They do not believe in the upgrading of the national road system to ensure that it is competitive and is capable of solving our great distance problems; they do not accept that those sorts of things are necessary or justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we develop arrangements with the States in this regard, they say, as even Premier Greiner has said, `We will take that money. We will be prepared to do those things'. But at the same time he is saying, `It is a bit of unfair economics that this is happening'. But they all put in their proposals because they know infrastructure does need upgrading. How is it going to be done? The One Nation package ensures that it is done in two ways. First, it ensures that we give the kick-start with the commitment to public infrastructure development in the initial stages. We also create the tax environment to encourage private infrastructure participation over the time of the package. They are positive initiatives; they are things that should be done. One of the great needs we have in this country if we are to ensure we are the export and outward looking country that we want to be is surely to ensure that our ports and the linkage to our ports are adequate, to ensure that our rail system is adequate, and to ensure that the National Rail Freight Corporation that we set up&mdash;it was not the Opposition&mdash;is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition might have talked about rail but it never did anything about it. We have actually ensured that the Rail Freight Corporation is put in place. The measures outlined last night take that a step further; standard gauge rail links around the country will ensure that we are able to compete. Of course, businesses will get the benefits of that, as many of them have readily acknowledged in the last 24 hours. All those things will be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package gives a real commitment to Australian tourism, an industry created in the 1980s by the Labor Government. We are going to ensure that it grows in the 1990s. The Government is committed to ensuring that our aviation policy is competitive, dynamic and able to cope with the changes that are involved in that area. The Government is particularly committed to ensuring that tourism, which has the potential to be our great growth industry of the 1990s, is given a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alternative from the Opposition? We have only to listen to tourism groups around Australia to see what they think about the goods and services tax and the impact it will have on the tourism industry. They have certainly been ready to acknowledge that the impact of the GST package on their industry, one of our great growth industries, will be very detrimental indeed. Let us compare that with the setting that we created in last night's statement. It is certainly the right sort of confidence booster, the right sort of kick-start that the tourism industry in so many of the important regional areas of Australia needs. In the major cities also, the industry needs airports and free movement to and from cities and the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next important element of our package is training. We recognise that the educating and skilling of our work force is important. It is really important when coming out of recession. All too often past experience has shown that in recession we lose much of that skills base. We already had a great commitment to higher education. That, with the massive commitment that was given last night, will ensure that the tier that has not received the attention it should have in the postwar period is given that attention&mdash;the TAFE sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vocational training and skills training are to be given the impetus they deserve as we lead into the 1990s. That is being done because a Labor Government at the Federal level is saying, `We are prepared to make a massive national commitment to TAFE training; we are prepared to ensure that the States, which so often have fallen short in providing TAFE resourcing at the level that is required to ensure that area is properly able to grow and develop to provide the opportunities for our young people, provide that training'. That is precisely the sort of message that needs to be given as we seek to move out of the recession into this important recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, we are maintaining our commitment to the school education system. It has not received as much publicity, but in last night's package there was further funding for the school education area. We know that the continuing demand and need in that area is one that governments have to address. Labor governments at the national level have always given priority to addressing the problems in school education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We move on from those initiatives to the fact that we believe in fairness and equity. We have heard a lot today about taxation issues. The tax reform measures taken over the period of this Government and the measures announced last night ensure that a spirit of fairness and equity is maintained. The assistance package for families announced last night&mdash;and the special payment to be received next month&mdash;is just the sort of stimulus to confidence that is needed. From the response I have had to that measure, I can certainly say that families in need really appreciate and welcome it. Those families know that the alternative&mdash;a 15 per cent consumption tax on everything that they purchase in the way of food and clothing&mdash;is going to slug those in need very severely indeed. That is something that cannot be tolerated. The people of Australia, who care about equity and fairness, will not let that happen. The Labor Government, which cares about social justice in that area, will not let that happen either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement contains important initiatives for the cities, for areas such as those I represent in western Sydney, growth areas so long neglected by conservative governments who did not really understand the needs in those areas. The problems we have with our roads, our education, the lack of resources we have for those sorts of facilities, are addressed in the statement. I welcome that very much. I think the Prime Minister deserves congratulations on the initiatives that have been undertaken in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to a few of those matters. In western Sydney, the north-south road link is being given a massive contribution of $25m to help accelerate construction of that Sydney by-pass so that commercial freight traffic and so forth can get around the city. It improves commercial competitiveness and economic efficiency and at the same time ensures safer conditions for the people in the western Sydney region. Likewise, the Government has given a commitment with respect to the major road construction at James Ruse Drive and Victoria Road, one of the major roads in the Sydney metropolitan area. It is a very positive initiative, a very tangible way for the Government to show that it is determined to ensure that commercial operations in that part of Sydney do have ready access to and from their workplaces, ports and railheads. Those are all very worthwhile, very positive initiatives that help to set the scene for economic recovery. So much of that process is going to be built around the confidence that the environment is right for business to get out and participate once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package does that. It leads the way. The Government is not standing back, as the Opposition would have us do, and saying, `Well, you go and do it; we will sit back and watch you do things'. The Government is leading the way, showing the direction and providing the leadership that the country needs to generate recovery, to create the 800,000 jobs that the Prime Minister spoke of last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be suggested, on any reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, that it does anything other than contract the total economy. Our fiscal stimulus to help kick-start the economy stands in stark contrast to the Opposition's contraction of the economy. The Opposition's proposal would ensure that inflation doubles. The Opposition's proposal would ensure that the basic needs of people are not given the attention they deserve. We will not let that happen. In fact, our package of measures seeks to open up the economy further. It seeks to ensure that our role, both in financial circles and in exports, is opened up more&mdash;a very positive move indeed, something that we should encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important in that context to note that we have ensured that business, small or large, has that environment within which to move forward. Measures in the statement cater for those various groups. Each of those groups can look forward, based on the strategy that has been developed in the One Nation package, to a period when they can seek to develop and expand their businesses, when the national economy will grow, because economic growth is what this package is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world economy and countries around the world face enormous challenges. The United States and other countries face huge challenges because of the depth of the economic difficulties they have. We certainly have a major challenge from this nation's point of view. The One Nation strategy takes up that challenge. It recognises the need for a sort of kick-start, for a responsible stimulus to activity. That is very much part and parcel of the Labor Government's ethos. For that reason, I believe it is a statement that the people of Australia will welcome. They will see it as providing the inspiration and direction the country needs. I firmly recommend the package to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say briefly to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who says that he comes from the rapidly growing western suburbs of Sydney and Parramatta and that this package does a lot for him: I come from the rapidly growing eastern suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;in fact I have the demographic centre of Melbourne in my electorate&mdash;and this package does almost nothing for the people in my electorate. Equally, let me say to him when he boasts about the six weeks of consultation by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): before we put together the Fightback package we spent 18 months on our Australia 2000 program consulting far more widely than the Prime Minister did in his six weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is, of course, a much publicised statement. The Prime Minister did make a great show about consulting and promising to take ideas on board. This was the opportunity for the Government to actually do something for the people of Australia on a sound long term basis. Of course, the Government had the advantage&mdash;Fightback had actually blazed the trail. We had shown the Government what could be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will have to report to the people in my electorate that last night the Prime Minister failed his big test. Why did he fail his big test? The answer is, as the Leader of the Opposition so effectively said earlier tonight, that the Prime Minister did not say how the Government is going to fund its multibillion dollar program. As every family in this country knows, one can only spend what one has got. The Government wants us all to go deeper in debt so that the Prime Minister can try to win the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say up front that there are some good bits in the package. For example, Australia and New Zealand as one air market is an excellent idea, on page 58 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; the national power grid, on page 59 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; capital gains tax relief for business, on page 37 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; one stop development approvals, on page 63 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; emergency relief for voluntary agencies, on page 62 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; training packages for long term unemployed, on page 213 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; assistance to non-government schools, on page 24 of supplementary paper No. 4; accelerated depreciation for business, on page 49 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; more TAFE funding, on page 37 of supplementary paper No. 4&mdash;and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But having said that, let us look at some of the other measures. When I go back tomorrow, what do I tell my constituents? I live in the real world. I actually get out and visit my electorate and, even more, I live in my electorate, unlike the previous Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister. What I am going to do is tell them about the infrastructure reform that is supposed to be the centrepiece of this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document. The Prime Minister said on television last night, `Spending should have been done years ago'. He said it on television for everybody to see and hear. I say to the Prime Minister of this country that he has boasted frequently, loud and long that he had his hands on the levers, so why did he not do it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at land transport. Rail reform, of course, is a key priority in Australia's micro-economic rehabilitation. But sinking $454m into a rail system that loses over $5 billion each year is a measure purely for short term political gain. Pouring money into railways means supporting the most inefficient, union dominated sector of our transport industry. For goodness sake, let us get the existing railways working properly, and then that is the appropriate time when we should start thinking about spending vast amounts on new lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the proposals in this package for waterfront reform? Show me the proposals in here for waterfront reform. There is not one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the proposals on telecommunications? One of the problems in this country is that we suffer from the tyranny of distance. A fundamental need in this country is telecommunications. The issue is not addressed in this document at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at aviation. The Government has taken up the Fightback idea of one air market. That is good, but the Government does not go far enough. Aviation reform is not about just letting airlines fly and letting more airlines fly and letting the international airlines take domestic passengers, and so on, which is important; it is also about running the terminals properly and commercially and providing good services so that we encourage business and tourism.

There are many businesses in Victoria, of course, the heartland of the manufacturing sector in this country. It is in a pretty sorry state at the moment because of the recession generated by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. It is business confidence which is most in need of restoration in this country. If we have the confidence, then we can overcome almost anything. We have to encourage business because it can make the biggest direct impact on turning the jobs crisis around. But what business wants is, of course, incentives to perform. So it needs lower costs. Where is that in the package? It needs better returns. Where is that in the package? It needs to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Prime Minister: are his big business consultees, those he went and talked to a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne and Sydney and so on, actually committed to invest in the package he has now announced? I very much doubt it. The Prime Minister has given them what they want. Why will they not give him the quid pro quo? They are just milking the Prime Minister because there are no clear measures in his statement to get business off its very comfortable backside. It has to get out there and compete and be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should have brought in stronger anti-dumping measures, and I see no mention of that in this document. There are imports coming into this country and there is nothing in here about anti-dumping. We are destroying small businesses, farmers and all sorts of other companies because we are slack in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in this document about abolishing regulation; there is nothing about lessening government interference. When is the Government going to lighten the load on business?  When is the Government going to take off some of that regulation? When is the Government going to streamline some of the duplications, triplications and all the rest of it between the States if we want to operate in business in this country? Why has the Government not abolished payroll tax, the tax on jobs? That not only impacts on big firms; it also has a trickle down effect. Why did the Government not abolish the fuel tax, the tax that applies to every business in this country and every leisure activity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this document the Government talks about assistance to exporters. Australia already spends around $550m per year on assistance to exporters. That is $10.40 for every $1,000 worth of exports, more than twice what is spent by most of our competitors overseas. But throwing money at exporters in the past has done very little good in terms of actually boosting exports, and throwing extra money, as proposed in this document, in large dollops to Austrade and so on is hardly the solution to increased competitiveness. </PARA>

We have a number of world class companies in this country, but it is only a handful, and we need more. We need to do a number of things to try to encourage those companies and grow more of those companies. We have to educate our scientists and our engineers, frankly, to be more commercially aware. But even more importantly, we have to educate our business managers to be even more technically aware, and when they have a problem they must instinctively turn to their R&amp;D departments and look for solutions to their problems. We have to get more commercial output from public sector R&amp;D expenditure, and to do this we must do it by establishing a more effective network between public and private partnerships, not contrived schemes. We must persuade more chief executives to show greater vision towards product innovation and to global markets. By `persuade' I mean we have to give them incentive, and incentive means profit and lowering their cost base. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a brief extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of last Monday. The Industry Commission's draft report on the national procurement development program said, `The program has so far provided $25m in grants for the development of new products'. The Commission reported that the scheme has been `driven by industry interests' and that `most of the money has been spent on projects that would have been developed anyway'. The report highlighted that, `only 10 of the 42 grant recipients have so far sold products developed under the scheme'. It mentions that `the administrative costs have been high' and that the `Commission is almost certain to recommend that the program be wound up at the end of this financial year'. Here is the interesting bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The politicians and the bureaucrats who designed and administered the program have not been using their own money; they have faced no penalty for poor commercial judgment. They have not been subject to the most basic discipline of the market.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we go again, perhaps. Let me be parochial; let me talk about my own patch. In my electorate of Aston we have had a 572 per cent increase in unemployment under this Government. Youth unemployment is running at nearly 40 per cent. People can witness the bankruptcies as they walk around and see the `For sale' and the `For lease' signs on factories, offices and shops. What do I tell my constituents about the special payment of $125 if they have one child or $250 if they have five children?  If they want to buy a pair of school shoes for the kids, they will cost about $50 or $60. The special payment is gone in one hit for the family with five children. Will that boost the economy?  Will that help the people out there who are bleeding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On unemployment, last night on television the Prime Minister said that the trend line, rather than the rate, is what matters. He should tell that to the marines. Tell it to the unemployed, to the school leavers, to the 55-year-old who has been retrenched and cannot get a job, to the parents of the kids who will come out of school next year, to the grandparents who did their bit and have watched this Government destroy the country. The Prime Minister's line will go down in history as his epitaph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax proposals are too little, too late, unfunded;  it is only bracket creep pay-back. The disadvantaged and lower paid are ignored. The 15 per cent wholesale sales tax that the Government is to apply to cars is on top of the costs, including payroll tax, petrol excise and all the other things which we will do away with. Under our scheme people will be better off. There is no industrial relations detail in this document. There is no information about health or how the Government will fix the hospital queues. There is nothing for the aged or the disabled; they do not get a mention. And what about women? P. P. McGuinness had a good line in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most curious thing about Paul Keating's mini-budget is how old-fashioned, male-orientated and naive it is.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I have to say that this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document is unfunded. It does only part of the job. In large measure it is a con because it puts off the evil day for this Government. I think there is a clear message coming out of all this for the Government backbenchers. I refer them to page 7 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, to an article that talks about a comparison between former President Ronald Reagan and President Bush and how they went in their country. Perhaps there is a parallel. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Bush&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has never enjoyed the kind of personal affection and support of the American people that Ronald Reagan enjoyed . . . in politics . . . if people like you, they will forgive you almost anything, and if they don't, look out.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps there is a parallel. The former Prime Minister had the personal affection. The people forgave him and they elected him time and time again. They do not like the present Prime Minister, and this document will confirm it when they start to rumble what a con it is. He and the Australian Labor Party had better look out. </PARA>

He also said that they would hate me because I had deserted some of my electors by moving my office from Maitland to Cessnock. There was not one mention of the GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to hear the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), pay tribute to the positives in the Prime Minister's package. The honourable member for Barker is far fairer, far more generous and far more discerning than his Leader. But even he makes mistakes. He stood here and said, `If we abolish the payroll tax, we will stimulate the textile and clothing industry. It is dying to have a Liberal government'. That is a load of codswallop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in the textile and clothing industry knows this: it hates the Australian Labor Party because progressively we will remove protection from that industry until by the year 2000 it remains at 25 per cent. But the Liberals, who claim to be the friends of those people who are employed in the textile and clothing industry, will not leave a balance of 25 per cent in the tariff. It is made abundantly clear in the Fightback package that by the year 2000 the protection for the textile, clothing and footwear industry will be reduced to zero. The Liberals have no sympathy at all. What lunacy it is for a respected member of parliament to stand here and to speak nonsense of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), cries foul and says that the Labor Government has stolen ideas from the Opposition's Fightback package. Remember how we all convulsed with laughter when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) revealed the extent to which the Opposition stole its Fightback package, virtually word for word, from New Zealand. Everyone who is present at the moment knows what the GST has done to that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston should tell his constituents that his Party wants to introduce a new tax which at the start will slug them 15 per cent and, as has happened in every other country, there will be an increase in that rate every year. Imagine the honourable member for Aston shedding crocodile tears for the unemployed. He mentioned the 55-year-old person who has been retrenched and who at that age finds it very difficult to gain employment. Does he remember that, after nine months of unemployment, under a Labor Government that person will still receive welfare?  But under the coalition parties, should they ever gain power, that person's welfare benefit will be cut completely. We have crocodile tears, but they just do not mean a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's economic statement was seen as a critical test of this Labor Government's ability to return economic growth to labour, to get people into jobs. Fair critics are saying that the Keating Government has passed that test with flying colours. Have those people opposite not heard the message from the media?  Fightback is forgotten;  One Nation has centre stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we rang 66 people, but when we asked which package they preferred the results were that 68 preferred the Keating package and none preferred the Hewson package. The discrepancy in the figures is due to the fact that my two secretaries voted. One person said to me, `Mate, how could you vote for them?  GST&mdash;what a misnomer!  It should be CTG, the cradle to the grave tax'. Effectively when we think about it, that is what it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating's economic cure will revive this nation's fortunes and create 800,000 jobs without increasing the current account deficit. There is help for business to invest and export. Next month, every Australian family receiving family allowance will share a $317m payment, and those who receive a supplement will get an increase of $3 per week for every child under 16 years of age. Let us compare that with what the Opposition offers. The Opposition will cancel family allowance when a child reaches 12 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possibly the greatest creation of jobs will flow from assistance to the tourist industry, and the Government has provided the proper environment for tourism to prosper.

TAFE has long been the poor relation of the higher education system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Keating package offers something for most people. However, we have resisted throwing money at short term job creation schemes in order to cut the dole queues. This means that few of the 800,000 jobs promised will appear immediately. However, the important point is that the foundation has been laid and the economy will grow while interest rates and inflation remain low.

However, on every path I walked along I was astonished to see people with torches dashing around and searching every nook and cranny.

It is not true, dear honourable member for Hunter, that the coalition's Fightback package will abolish family allowances at the age of 12 years.

Then he might come face to face with reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it; we are talking about reality. I think this Parliament should face up to the reality of what is facing the people of Australia at the present time. Last night we heard the package of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I was reminded of that famous quote by Disraeli, `There are lies, damned lies and statistics'. After last night, I suppose one could say, `There are lies, damned lies and Keating'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point is that, when one looks in detail at the package put down last night, one can see that it is unfunded. It is based on debt and more debt. If one were going to find a simple, significant difference between Fightback and the Prime Minister's One Australia package, it is that and that alone&mdash;that is the most significant thing. The Prime Minister's package is unfunded and the Fightback package is totally funded, and the costs are detailed everywhere. As I have said, the Prime Minister's package is based on debt and more debt. </PARA>

Gross domestic product in this recession is down by 3.2 per cent. That is about 7 per cent below where it would be under normal circumstances. Bankruptcies are up 144 per cent. The honourable member for Hunter may smile, but I can tell him that the people in Cessnock and the rest of his electorate whose shops have closed and whose businesses have gone are not smiling. So it is with people right around Australia. Bankruptcies are up 144 per cent, and of course that is only the tip of the iceberg because so many of our farmers and small business people are in such drastic financial trouble that they are not going bankrupt; they are having to just walk away and close their doors. </PARA>

But during Question Time, he sits and he laughs and he jokes and gets that smarmy smile on his face; he waves his finger around in the air at his head, pointing at the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I do not think the people of Australia need a Prime Minister with that lack of dignity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extra 140,000 Australian families have been pushed into extended poverty and 248,000 Australians have been unemployed for more than a year. Youth unemployment is about 30 per cent, but it is very much higher in some areas. There are 60,000 young Australians who cannot get into university this year. Nearly 100,000 cannot get into TAFE. We have 60,000 on the public hospital waiting lists. Just listen to what I have been saying. This is a success story? This is the way Australia should be after nine years of the honourable member for Blaxland as Treasurer and now Prime Minister? I cannot believe it. Juvenile crime has increased by five times. </PARA>

This is the great country we have? It is not good enough. We just cannot go along with this. We have to have change. Change is what we in the coalition are offering. We are offering the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention just a few things we are going to do. Comparing Fightback with the Prime Minister's One Nation is a salutary exercise. They do not really compare. Although it is interesting to note that the Prime Minister has pinched a fair bit from Fightback. He has taken the 30 per cent marginal tax rate, but will not implement it until 1996&mdash;two years after we would bring it in. The Government might smile, as he did, and just dismiss it, but we cannot accept a situation in which half the Australian taxpayers are not getting a tax cut under the Prime Minister's package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I say what I had intended to say, I would follow on from my friend the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). Of course, everyone in this chamber shares the sentiments that he expressed about people who are struggling today as a result of unemployment. There can be no question about the extent of his compassion and feeling about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greatest of respect and regard for my colleague, I find it a little strange that Opposition members who present their package, which has so much in it for the wealthy of Australia and so much not in it for the lower income earners of Australia, including a nice little 15 per cent consumption tax on just about everything they spend their money on, would choose to make this the issue on which they would have a debate such as this. I would have thought the honourable member for Cowper would be embarrassed about the goods and services tax and his package if he was going to talk in terms of low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does one tell people like pensioners that one is going to add 15 per cent to everything they buy and then give them compensation of 8 per cent? I am yet to understand how 15 equals eight. No doubt those opposite will spend some time working it out; as will the pensioners. The honourable member for Cowper says that students and people who are unemployed&mdash;people who are not in the work force&mdash;somehow benefit from the Opposition's tax cuts. If people do not earn a wage they do not get tax cuts; but they do get to pay the 15 per cent consumption tax. How this all adds up as a package for people whom the honourable member for Cowper purports to be worried about here tonight does stretch the credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what is in the statement delivered last night. What is there is $2.3 billion of real spending that will take place in the economy over the next 12 months to get these people back in the work force. We have the funds because we have put a decent Budget together for nine years. We have removed the Government's debt and we are able to fund this sort of expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to publicly thank the Ministers who I, as a backbencher, have lobbied in the last three weeks. I have never lobbied harder in my life than in the last three weeks to get what I wanted in that statement last night. I have to say that it was all there. The view I put to the Ministers was: it is no good trying to solve a big problem with big answers;  the way we have to tackle this is to look at the problems at a micro level, like smaller pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and find answers for those smaller problems; and as they come into being, the bigger answer comes into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put a plan for my electorate to the Ministers. If the House will forgive me, I will go through some of the components of that plan to demonstrate the way that it has happened. My electorate is right at the end of the most absurd position in the Australian railway network; that is, right at the end of the railway line that makes it way from Perth to Melbourne. What happens to goods being transported from Western Australia to the east via Melbourne is that somewhere around Adelaide they all get lifted off their axles and have new wheels put under them in order to come to Victoria on an absurd broad gauge railway line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth can we say to the world and to Australia that we are serious about a national rail corporation and reform if we cannot even have a decent standard gauge railway system around Australia?  It is the question that those on the other side of the House should have asked themselves every year. The honourable member for Cowper talks about shame. Members of the Opposition should have asked themselves every year they were in government why they were not doing something about fixing up the broad gauge railway problem from Perth to Brisbane.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here it is being delivered, and here it is happening. My electorate happens to be right at the core of the decision to make Melbourne the commercial gateway of Australia by hubbing and linking the airports, the rail, the road and the infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turned to the Ministers and said, `I have people who work at motor vehicle component companies and motor vehicle companies like Ford in my electorate. They can't have jobs unless we can restore demand in the motor vehicle industry'. I have to say that I did not expect anything as big. I sat here last night dumbfounded. The best keep secret in that package last night was knocking 5 per cent off the sales tax for a Ford Falcon. I have already had people ringing up my electorate office today asking whether they get the $850 if they buy their car today. That is what we want. They know that there is a decent advantage there to get moving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Cowper said, it is a good move. I am just thrilled that it has been there in the statement. Take companies like John Brown at Kyneton and Daytex at Gisborne. They are textile companies which have done everything that we have asked of them to reform, to look to export opportunities. The problem with them is that they have lost their domestic demand. We have to get people buying in the marketplace to return that demand. The kick-start in this economy will do that. Those people will in fact benefit further from the textile package that is in the statement delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest point for me, in a quick short sense, is my export abattoirs at Kyneton, which were disgracefully closed for the last three years. Four hundred jobs were just wiped out like that. This was not because of to Wally Curran and the meatworkers, as those on the other side of the House would run around saying, but because crooks were running the joint and because the bank had loaned millions of dollars over the asset valuation. The bank would not sell it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) knows exactly what I am talking about because he chaired the banking inquiry. The abattoirs were sitting there dead because the banks would not sell and would not write off the debt. The announcement last night to provide partial write-offs opens the door for 400 jobs in one of my key towns in the next few weeks. I will work on nothing harder than solving that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest success story in my region has been Melbourne airport. Melbourne airport is the one place in Australia where the international terminal and the domestic terminals are together. One has not this idiotic position of people having to catch a cab for five kilometres to get from Qantas around to Australian Airlines. We have opened up aviation policy; we have given Melbourne enormous opportunity to expand its airport facilities. I think that is tremendous. People living in towns like Sunbury, which depends on the airport, know the real value of a decision like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to TAFE places, there is a brand new college and a university in my territory:  Melton campus of the VUT, the new western university and Broadmeadows TAFE college. Just to give the House an example, when these centres were opened it was predicted that their enrolments would reach 5,000 in seven years; they reached 7,000 in three years. In Melton's case it will be 7,000 in 2 1/2 years. The numbers have blown out of all proportion. It is not only because people are staying there because they do not have a job to go&mdash;that is part of the short term problem&mdash;but also it is due to the demand for education from people in our region who have been denied it for decades by Liberal governments which did not care about the north and west of Melbourne. It is like a giant blotter; no matter how many opportunities we provide, these people will soak them up because they want them. Our decision last night to offer to take over the funding from the States and guarantee those places means that there will be no hitch in the growth and development of these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to pick another point, in the early 1980s we had a phenomenal success rate in kick-starting the economy in my territory with a sensible use of the community employment program; that is, we provided locally based jobs which gave people a chance to get a foothold back into the work force. There were two little rippers in that statement last night:  the job skills package and the community sports program, which is about to be announced by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Again, a couple of my colleagues in the chamber now have been punting away at these for a long time. These programs are ready to go tomorrow. The plans are there and the applications are there. When we give the money, the jobs will be there in two weeks. For me, last night was a turning point for this country. I am thrilled to support the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On seven separate occasions this century many thousands of Australians have selflessly risked their lives for what they believed was a cause worth fighting for. From the bloody beaches at Anzac Cove and the rugged hills of Gallipoli, from the nightmare of the Western Front, Tobruk, Kokoda, the Burma Railway, Malaya, Korea and Vietnam to the recent war in the Persian Gulf, Australians have fought and died, believing that this was the only way of ensuring that their descendants would live in a free and peaceful world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the fact that the vast majority of Australians are rightly very proud of their nation's military achievements during this century is a continuing thorn in the side of the ageing hippies from the campuses of the 1960s who now occupy so many positions of influence in this phoney Labor Government. One can only wonder what the beard-stroking trendoids and ageing earth mothers must have made of the extraordinary pilgrimage to Gallipoli on Anzac Day 1990!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What could have gone wrong? Why were the crowds at Anzac Day marches larger than they had been for some years? Why had so many Australians in their twenties and thirties made such an effort to get to Gallipoli for the seventy-fifth anniversary? Why was there so much interest in that unique band of original Anzacs who returned to pay one final tribute to the mates of their youth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the inordinate and destructive influence of the so-called intellectuals of the 1960s on government policy, it is therefore not at all surprising that Labor has engaged in a continual war of attrition against the veterans community since its election in 1983. I will give just two examples of many with which I am familiar. Firstly, there is a widow of a veteran who served in the Great War and in the 1939-45 war. The veteran had been totally deafened in the Battle of the Coral Sea. As his widow explained to me, his quality of life was hopelessly inadequate. Today his widow receives a pension of $1.64 per fortnight. What an insult!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is Mr Ken West, a former member of ground support on RAAF Mirage fighters both in Australia and Malaysia. Everybody who worked on this aspect of Mirage maintenance incurred back problems. Ken had several back fusions while still in the Air Force. However, he is now in constant pain and cannot work. Yet can he obtain a reasonable pension? Not a chance. Even the Veterans' Review Board where Ken and I have appeared has doubts. Yet it does not dispute the injury. This attitude towards our veterans community is absolutely scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community is well aware of the miserable treatment of our Vietnam veterans. However, given the activities of what Paddy McGuinness has so brilliantly described as the `anti-Vietnam RSL', the Government's hostility to those who served in Vietnam is hardly surprising. Nevertheless, it is now 1992 and one might ask: will they be punished forever?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1944 Ben Chifley made an historic promise to those who had been prepared to put Australian interests before their own. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the animosity of the Government towards our veterans community and the traditions it represents reached a new low on Remembrance Day 1991. Not only did the Government, I am told, in a typical display of arrogance fail to observe the minute's silence at 11 a.m., but to add insult to injury it was conspicuous by its absence at the War Memorial service. I was at this service and I was embarrassed that only a handful of Government members bothered to attend. What a sorry comment on the depths to which this once great political party has sunk when its members have so obviously forgotten that it was its most outstanding leader who, speaking at the 1941 opening of the nation's tribute to its 60,000 dead sons, expressed his hope that the Memorial would give continuity to the Anzac tradition and the basic impulses of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I felt the need to start my publishing company because of what I see as the bias in a lot of the present day media. I think the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ought to have a really good look at itself. Like so many organisations it has become a propaganda outfit and has lost any interest in purveying simply the truth. One finds that the ABC has its agenda and holds its views so strongly that it is prepared to defend them even to the extent of lying. The ABC is not alone in this; I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> are other classic examples of this phenomenon. In fact in response to a case before the Australian Press Council accusing it of bias, the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently said it was pro-immigration and pro-multiculturalism, and intended to put that case. That is all very well, but to put an exclusion or a distortion of the opposite case is certainly not Australian and not in the interests of free speech or, I might add, of good journalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have published several titles under this new publishing company; Kerry Packer, eat your heart out. With <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Australian Retrospective</EMPHASIS>, a friend of mine, Mark Uhlmann, and I decided we would rewrite the history of Australia from 1788 to 1945. This is not anything new; it has been done many times before, usually in a very distorted way. It has usually been written so as to belittle Australia and to try to denigrate Australians by saying there is no culture in Australia. I commend to honourable members the words of Mary Gilmore, one of our great poets:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never allow the thoughtless to declare that we have no tradition here.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very common failing these days for people to deride our past achievements, to denigrate what happened in the past and to fail to realise that judgments about the past should be made in the context of the past and not by present day standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one applies the standards of the past, Australia's history was generally very benign. It was observed by one of America's great authors when he visited Australia that Australia's history was so great that it read like a fairy tale, but it was all true. He was very impressed with the history of Australia and I think it is a pity that more of that history is not taught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to multiculturalism. We are having multiculturalism foisted upon us in Australia. I will read from one of my latest publications&mdash;I write the forewords to all my publications; I find I do it best&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of multiculturalism is portrayed by its proponents as some sort of benign, natural manifestation of Australia's ethnic diversity. But the public justification for multiculturalism involves a series of insidious and deliberate distortions. Firstly, race and birthplace are made interchangeable with culture though it is clear that people of different racial backgrounds can and do identify with a single culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, because of Australia's component of different racial backgrounds or those born overseas we are designated as a `multicultural' country. If this deliberate distortion were to be accepted, it still would not follow automatically that a government policy was required to enshrine the designation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then comes the second deliberate distortion: `multicultural' is made interchangeable with the policy of multiculturalism. When Bob Hawke stated in 1989 that we had `no choice' but to be a `multicultural' nation, what he was really saying was that we had no choice but to pursue the policy of multiculturalism. Further, the implication was that those who questioned the policy were actually objecting to our `multicultural' makeup&mdash;ie our racial diversity&mdash;and so were clearly racists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This intellectual dishonesty must be apparent to the academics, bureaucrats, journalists and politicians who support multiculturalism, but it seems that many of them have convinced themselves that the policy of multiculturalism is such a worthy ideal that they are justified in lying in its defence. People with a duty to inform and educate have become deliberate propagandists. Not only can we not trust them to tell the truth, they have actively attempted to suppress freedom of speech on behalf of the policy.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I have to tell you, Sir, that this indicates that the honourable member for Corio had not read the package as thoroughly as I would have expected of him. The goods and services tax would not apply on a second-hand car; it would apply only on the difference between the trade-in price and the sale price of a second-hand car.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do not deny that. I have never denied that. I have never pretended otherwise. Of course there would be tax cuts and of course there would be less Commonwealth money collected. That has not been denied by anyone on this side of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the GST package is to tax people more fairly. Even the farmers around Australia, whom the honourable member for Hinkler purports to represent, can be reassured that every dollar in tax they pay on a business input&mdash;the point made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson)&mdash;will be rebated to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have heard the honourable member for Hinkler make the point that removal of the wholesale sales tax would not be advantageous to farmers. I am well aware of that; I agree with that. That is the superficial argument. But the removal of the wholesale sales tax would be deliberately advantageous, for example, to every trucking operator that services rural Australia because he or she currently pays wholesale sales tax on the rig and on the spare parts. With the removal of the wholesale sales tax, the rig would be cheaper, spare parts would be cheaper and so the servicing of rural Australia would be cheaper. If that were not enough, they would also buy their diesel for the same price as the farmer currently gets diesel&mdash;that is, wholesale sales tax exempt&mdash;because, although a GST would be applied, that GST would be rebated as a business cost, further reducing the cost of servicing rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise two points tonight, although there will not be time to cover them fully. Firstly, I take umbrage at one of the earlier speakers who criticised the Government and the Australian Labor Party in regard to veterans affairs and the defence of this country. It is quite clear that no party in the history of this nation has ever done as much for the defence of this nation as has the Australian Labor Party in both wars. I would also like to make the point that, under the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), some $5.3 billion is allocated to the veteran community&mdash;more than twice what it was when Labor came to office. I am very disappointed that there would be partisanship, rather than bipartisanship, on this issue, because it should be above that. As the name of a member of my family is on a plaque at the Australian War Memorial, I am disappointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) raised. I respect his genuine concern for the rural community and his integrity. He is one of the members on the other side&mdash;there are a couple, but not many&mdash;who has a lot of integrity. But, unfortunately, he has been locked into a monkey called the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield talked about rebating inputs and all the rest of it. But the fact is that, under the GST package, the person at the end of the line, the person who pays the retail price, would pay the tax at 15 per cent. What was also not mentioned was that fruit and vegetables, which currently are not taxed, would incur a tax of 15 per cent. Meat would incur a tax of 15 per cent. Milk would incur a tax of 15 per cent. Bread would incur a tax of 15 per cent. In other words, the honourable member can forget about all the business inputs and all that nice rhetoric. At the end of the line, there would be a tax of 15 per cent and what it means is that 15 per cent of the purchasing capacity of the consumer would be lost because it would go to revenue. It would not go back to the farmers. It would not go back to the transport operator or to anybody within the agricultural structure. It would go to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said it many times and I will say it again: the fruit and vegetable industry in Queensland is worth $700m per annum. A 15 per cent tax on that would be $100m-plus. Bundaberg, the city of my birth and the biggest city in my electorate, is the biggest horticultural centre in Australia. That city would lose 15 per cent at the top retail rate. That money would not go back to growers or to the agents; it would go in tax. Over $100m from that industry in Queensland would go in tax. No matter how the Opposition wraps it up or talks about it, that is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse than that, tax on the people at the bottom end of the market, the people whom the Opposition was pretending to care about today, the people at the bottom end of the income scale, would drop back to about 16 per cent. Those opposite are proud of that. But those people would then have to pay 15 per cent on everything they buy&mdash;every service and every good. In other words, they would pay 31 per cent. The pensioners would get 8 per cent in compensation, yet every time they put their hands in their pockets to pull out a dollar they would lose 15 per cent of it. People do not have to be really bright to work out whether they would be better off or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of taxation under the Liberal Party when it was last in office. We remember the straw companies. Why did we need a National Crime Authority? It was to stop the problems that were happening with straw companies in Western Australia when those on the other side of the House were in power. Where were the spivs and the people who rorted the system with tax fraud? They thrived under the former Liberal Party Government, which refused to act for seven years. That is why we have the NCA, and that is why we brought in a decent tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the other side of the coalition&mdash;at the National Party of Australia. What can one say? In Queensland, there are more of them in gaol than outside it. The only way that one could get a knighthood in Queensland, unless one was very lucky, was to be on the take. The biggest knight of the lot in Queensland, the biggest crook of the lot, the senior law officer in Queensland, Sir Terence Lewis, is in gaol right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do not need to be told anything about propriety; we do not need to be told anything about accountability; we do not need to be told anything about taxation. We will talk about straw companies over the next 12 months. We will talk about defending the poor. We will talk about defending the working class because we know that, when their hands go into their pockets to pay for fruit, vegetables and food, so will the hands of those opposite. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
