<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill seeks to remove from the provisions of the various Commonwealth superannuation schemes discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status. The legislation will come into effect from 25 June 1993 and will apply to benefits payable as a result of the death of a person on or after that date. The existing provisions of the various Commonwealth superannuation schemes will continue to apply to benefits which became payable as the result of the death of a person before that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill brings the Commonwealth superannuation schemes into line with amendments the Government made to the Sex Discrimination Act only last year. The date for the commencement of these amendments is the same as that for the private sector schemes under the relevant changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. The basic thrust of the amendments is to broaden the eligibility for qualification as a spouse to better reflect present day realities. We are assured that no current eligibility will be denied by the operation of the Bill. The definition of spouse is not being expanded to include partners of the same sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will also remove the different treatment between a nuptial and an ex-nuptial child for the purposes of reversionary benefits. The coalition has no difficulties with these amendments and will be supporting the Bill. The fact that the Bill will lead to an increase in the level of future entitlements payable by the Commonwealth does, however, highlight the growing concern about the extent of unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, in report No. 3, has estimated that the extent of the Commonwealth's unfunded superannuation liabilities amounts to around $38 billion. Similarly, large sums are outstanding in respect of non-Commonwealth public sector superannuation schemes and represent a major fiscal burden on the public sector in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one solution to this growing problem; that is, for public sector superannuation schemes to move onto a fully funded basis as soon as practicable. Otherwise, the public sector in Australia, and the Commonwealth Government in particular, will be staring down the barrel of a massive blow-out in outlays that will undermine the fiscal policies of future governments. The coalition believes that all employer sponsored superannuation funds should be operated on a fully funded basis. The coalition will be moving in that direction when in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill, as outlined by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), amends the range of Commonwealth Acts which govern the payment of superannuation to Commonwealth employees and their families. The reason for the amendments is to bring these various Commonwealth super schemes into line with the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. The Bill is one step in a very long process to have superannuation schemes in Australia, both public and private, operate fairly for both men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the context of this Bill, I think it is necessary to look, briefly at least, at the history of the exemption enjoyed by superannuation schemes under the Sex Discrimination Act. In 1983, when the then Attorney-General, Senator Evans, tabled the Sex Discrimination Bill in the Senate for public consultation, superannuation schemes in the original Bill were to be exempt from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act for two years, which was to allow time for schemes to adjust their arrangements to make them comply with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that Bill, the superannuation and life insurance industries argued that they would have a great deal of difficulty complying with the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. As a result of their representations, this two-year exemption contained in the original Bill was replaced with a blanket exemption which simply meant that the Sex Discrimination Act did not apply to superannuation schemes or to life insurance policies. However, although the Government at that stage accepted the blanket exemption, it did so with the proviso that an inquiry would be undertaken to investigate in more detail the concerns raised by the superannuation industry. It was always the intention that the Sex Discrimination Act would in due course apply to superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry which the Attorney announced at that time was conducted by the then Human Rights Commission and was not presented to Parliament until November 1986. It was a fair time before this inquiry got under way, and it was a long inquiry. The report of the Human Rights Commission recommended that the blanket exemption which was then within the Sex Discrimination Act as it was passed in 1984 be replaced and that all super schemes comply with the anti-discriminatory provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. The National Agenda for Women, which was released in 1988, also canvassed at some depth the issue of superannuation and women. The agenda stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The security and independence of older women can be enhanced by the removal of discrimination in occupational superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>The national agenda contains an action plan which outlines what the Government would do over the life of the agenda&mdash;that is, the five years from 1988 to 1993. In the agenda, the Government committed itself to proceeding with legislation to remove the total exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act and replace it with a more limited exemption which would have a two-year transition period. It was back to square one. The initial Bill presented in 1983 talked about a two-year transition period. The national agenda, coming out some five years later, in 1988, also talked about a more limited exemption having a two-year transition period. This is still a significant watering down of the initial intention of the first Sex Discrimination Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the intent of the national agenda, the Human Rights Commission report and the initial statements by the Attorney-General back in 1983 saw the light of day in May 1989, when amendments were proposed to the Sex Discrimination Act. However, that Bill in turn had a rather chequered history. Whilst it was presented to the House in May 1989, it was never debated and, with the dissolution of the Parliament for the March 1990 election, that Bill lapsed. The amendments were then incorporated into a second Bill which was introduced in September 1990. That Bill also did not proceed and was withdrawn in favour of a third Bill, which was finally passed by the Parliament and I believe received royal assent in June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now debating the consequences of that Bill, and the final exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act concerning superannuation schemes, approaching 10 years after the initial Sex Discrimination Bill provided that all schemes should comply with the provisions of that Act. So it has taken a very long period to reach the mechanics Bill that we have in front of us to make sure that Commonwealth superannuation schemes comply with the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. Unfortunately, in my view, although the Bill before us today is to be welcomed, in essence it does not go far enough, because it is only complying with the Sex Discrimination Act, which means that superannuation schemes, both private and public, must not directly discriminate on the basis of sex and marital status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the evidence which was received by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for Australian women on the issue of superannuation indicated that the major problem with the operation of superannuation schemes for women was not direct discrimination but indirect discrimination. How that occurs is the fundamental difference between the career and work patterns of men and women. The work pattern of Australian women is mostly characterised by a process of interruption for the care of children. Normally, or in an average case if there is such a thing, a woman will enter the work force at a relatively young age, after school or after a period in further education. She will stay in the work force for a period of years, normally in part time work, but then she will leave the work force for a period of two to five years when the family is being raised. In fact, between the ages of 25 and 29, Australian women are five times more likely than Australian men to leave the work force for a time. That is obviously the time when most women are having their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that absence from paid employment, women will often return to the paid work force, but commonly through the mechanism of part time work. It should be noted that women comprise well over 70 per cent of the part time work force in Australia. Over time, women may then finally resume full time paid employment. That, of course, contrasts most starkly with the career pattern of Australian men, which normally is not interrupted at all by men taking out time from the work force to be involved in direct parenting responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean in terms of the operation of superannuation schemes and women? Until recently at least, until the most recent reforms to superannuation introduced by the Government, it meant that first of all women had a very poor coverage by superannuation, more so than the overall work force. Women were generally in occupations which did not enjoy superannuation coverage. It must be remembered that Australia has the most gender segregated work force in the Western world. Women are clustered in a narrow range of occupations and, generally speaking, those occupations had not until very recently enjoyed superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will also recall that women comprise well over 70 per cent of the part time work force, and even today many part time workers do not enjoy superannuation coverage. That is starting to change. It is starting to change quite dramatically. The national wage decision back in 1987 to extend the 3 per cent productivity superannuation award was the first big leap, I suppose, in broadening out superannuation and its coverage throughout the Australian work force, and the range of initiatives the Government has made to change superannuation schemes has made them far more applicable to the part time work force and to workers with broken career patterns. So a lot of the work which the Government has done means that superannuation schemes are now going to be enjoyed by far more women workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further pattern of schemes which until very recently discriminated very much against women, not so much directly but indirectly, was the way in which vesting and preservation provisions worked. Again, these provisions were more or less based on a model of a worker who was in full time uninterrupted work, so that if he left employment after a period often the vesting provisions were very discriminatory. Normally workers were able to get back only their own contributions; they were losing their employer contributions. It was difficult to preserve contributions into schemes. Again, the Government has moved to change that and the situation has significantly improved from what it was just a few years ago, but as the schemes have operated in Australia they have been very much against the interests of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, due to the nature of the interrupted career pattern of women and the fact that they may not rejoin the full time paid work force until relatively later in life, say, at age 35 or 40, the time they have had to accumulate benefits to be paid out at the time of retirement means that their level of accumulated benefit is on the whole much less than that enjoyed by an equivalent male worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those difficulties which I have outlined in the operation of superannuation schemes are not at this moment canvassed by the Sex Discrimination Act. They are all in their operation indirect provisions and not direct provisions, which the legislation before us is attempting to make Commonwealth schemes comply with, and which the legislation in the Sex Discrimination Act also now makes private schemes comply with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what should the Government be turning its mind to? I encourage the Government to look closely at the discussion on these issues contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half Way to Equal</EMPHASIS> report and in particular the recommendation on the operation of superannuation schemes, which is recommendation No. 21 of the report. I will just go through those briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that any superannuation policy reforms, including that of Commonwealth schemes, should encompass the following specific matters: firstly, the establishment of vesting, preservation and portability provisions that take into account women's broken work patterns in all schemes&mdash;and that is fundamental; secondly, superannuation schemes permit parents to retain membership rights during maternity and parental leave, with contributions frozen whilst on leave; thirdly, the promotion of the use of flexible and nil employee contribution rates so that women moving between full time, part time and unpaid work can maintain membership of a superannuation fund with contributions tailored to their current economic circumstances; fourthly, the qualifying period for the coverage by employer-sponsored superannuation to be reduced to that required by the superannuation guarantee levy, all employer contributions vest immediately and be fully preserved, and measures for improved portability between funds as suggested in the report to be investigated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission; and, finally, far more emphasis on the education of young workers as to the importance of superannuation and where their contributions are taking them, so that people plan in advance and take due regard of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill before the House is to be very much welcomed, as I have said, it is in a sense a mechanical set of provisions which are nonetheless important, particularly in relation to the payments for de facto spouses and ex-nuptial children, an area of quite overt discrimination in the way in which Commonwealth schemes in the past have operated. That overt discrimination is being removed. However, the Sex Discrimination Act requires neither Commonwealth schemes nor private schemes to make sure that they do not indirectly discriminate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, to its credit, has largely taken up these issues through its reform of superannuation, and the end result is a vastly superior superannuation environment for women workers than existed even two or three years ago. That is how recent these changes are. Nonetheless, I think a useful step would be not only to require Commonwealth and private schemes not to discriminate directly but also to ensure that the indirect discrimination provisions within the Sex Discrimination Act are also applied to superannuation schemes. As far as the Bill goes, it certainly has my full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is discussing the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill. The Bill amends Commonwealth superannuation legislation to remove discrimination on the grounds of marital status in line with the Commonwealth's 1991 amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. The amendments will bring the Commonwealth superannuation schemes into line with the requirements under the Sex Discrimination Act for private sector superannuation schemes. The main changes involve the removal of so-called discrimination between legally married spouses and de facto ones. The Bill proposes a series of criteria to define `spouse', the new gender neutral term that replaces `widow' and `widower' in Acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector has been put on notice that by the middle of next year it will be required to recognise de facto relationships for the payment of superannuation. That is based on the Sex Discrimination Act&mdash;in which, surprisingly, one finds that `marital status' is defined as being single, married, married but living separately and apart from one's spouse, divorced, widowed or the de facto spouse of another person. So, for the purposes of Commonwealth legislation, the Sex Discrimination Act equates people living in a married relationship with those living in a de facto relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act, it can be seen that discrimination cannot take place on the basis of marital status. So within the sex discrimination legislation discrimination on the grounds of whether or not one is married is linked with a definition of marital status that recognises de facto relationships as being equivalent to marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see great difficulties in this approach for many areas of administrative law. The processes adopted in the Sex Discrimination Act and their consequences have created administrative problems. In seeking to equate a legally constituted marriage with a de facto relationship, one should remember that married couples make a public statement that they will share responsibility for children and property and will care for each other for life. That commitment to each other is recognised by law in the Marriage Act. However, a de facto relationship does not require a public statement and does not have a legal basis except in common law. The Family Law Act is being considered by a joint committee of the Parliament. I guess that the Committee would have under active consideration de facto relationships, how they can be established within the law, how they should be viewed by the community and by our courts, and whether we should continue to rely on common law or use some other process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to issues such as superannuation schemes, there is a financial advantage in being able to establish that there is a relationship. The difficulties of proving what is a de facto relationship and all the uncertainties that arise from that process have shown up in a number of areas. They have shown up in the social security Acts; they have shown up in the migration Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that Australia took a good look at where we have moved to in writing something into the Sex Discrimination Act to placate people who feel that they are discriminated against when, on the other hand, married couples feel discriminated against under other Acts because of the possible denial of benefits. So we have here a conflict between a private understanding which may be seen differently by each party and a legally recognised and publicly stated situation. Really it is the equating of a lifestyle arrangement with a legal commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uncertainties of de facto relationships are apparent in the Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill and other Acts of this Parliament. We are looking ahead, I guess, to further changes to the Sex Discrimination Act whereby further entitlements are given&mdash;completely improperly, in my view, because all people should be equal before the law. It appears to me that there is a bias against those people who have made a lifetime commitment in marriage as compared with those in a de facto relationship. On death or separation, there are different grounds for making assessments of entitlement, depending on whether it is a de facto couple or a legally married couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Social Security Act, additional benefits are gained by those people who are not married. But if there is in existence a de facto relationship that can be proved, which is very difficult to do&mdash;as a nation we have been through the difficulties of trying to prove whether there is in existence a relationship that can be called a de facto relationship&mdash;a lesser benefit applies. The community is a bit sick and tired of people rorting the system, suiting themselves by seeking recognition of a de facto relationship as a marriage-like relationship but, on the one hand, seeking to gain benefits that they are not properly entitled to if that relationship really exists. However, a marriage has a legal basis and administrative matters can easily be dealt with by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Immigration Act, a similar situation applies: a person who can establish that he or she is in a de facto relationship with an Australian citizen has the right to apply for Australian residency. All sorts of claims of a de facto relationship based on bodgie documents have been allowed by the Department because there is no way of determining whether in fact a de facto relationship exists. We have the Commonwealth today legislating on such weak grounds as de facto relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that we as a parliament looked at this matter and sorted it out in the interests of fairness before the law and in the way in which people are dealt with by the great departments of state. Married couples, who have made commitments and who are bound by law, should not continue to be disadvantaged as compared with those who enter into a lesser and looser relationship because it suits them. I make no judgment about what people wish to do with their lifestyles, but I do make a judgment about the way in which they are being treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the Bill before the House somewhat objectionable because it puts into further law the understanding that a de facto relationship is indeed the same as a legally constituted marriage. That is not the case. I sound a warning that I believe that the private sector and the Government are unnecessarily paying funds for benefits of all sorts because of the looseness of the law and the failure of this Parliament and our community to come to grips with this vexed problem. It is time that we did. Therefore, whilst I will not vote against this measure, I think it is completely improper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic (Environment Protection) Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 enables Australia to meet its obligations under the 1991 Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. The purpose of that protocol was to prevent mining in the Antarctic. As has become the practice of Ministers in the House, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) tried to make out that the Government has a total monopoly on concern about the Antarctic, as indeed she tries to make out that the Government has a monopoly on concern about any aspect of the environment&mdash;and, of course, that Opposition members are rapists and pillagers of the environment, have no concern for it, and, if returned to office, would do disgraceful things to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are totally false accusations, as anybody with any objectivity would acknowledge. In listening to the Minister's second reading speech one would think she invented the Antarctic, but let us look back on the facts of Australia's relationship to Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which was a very important measure, was brought about during the period of the Menzies Government. The Cold War was a major factor. It was important to ensure peace and orderly management of this fragile territory, and the Antarctic Treaty was a great milestone internationally in doing that. It was certainly something that the Menzies Government was very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major legislation to protect the environment in the Antarctic was brought forward in 1980 by my then colleague Mr David Thomson, the Minister for Science and the Environment. I was delighted to go back to his second reading speech when he was introducing the Antarctic Treaty Environment Protection Bill of 1980, where he set out the very clear environmental objectives of the Fraser Government. Again, no objective reader of history could accuse that Government or its coalition successors of lacking concern for these matters. This was demonstrated in this area when the Opposition initially, before the Government, suggested that, instead of proceeding with negotiations on a regime for the exploration of mining in the Antarctic, we should go further and prevent mining altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were delighted that the Government took this up and took the lead in that internationally&mdash;which we acknowledge&mdash;supported initially by the French and then subsequently by the other treaty parties. In 1991 the Madrid Protocol, as it came to be known, was signed, and today we have this legislation to bring into effect under Australian law the provisions of that protocol. These are basically to prevent mining, but there are other elements of it: to allow for environmental assessment in the Antarctic, to bring in a new system of protective areas there, to allow for greater protection for Antarctic fauna and flora and their habitats, and for the making of regulations providing for environmental impact procedures and for waste management and waste disposal. It tidies up a lot of legislation in this area in quite a sensible way, and the Opposition fully supports the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most regrettable that on this, as on other measures&mdash;I notice that the endangered species protection legislation is being brought in this afternoon&mdash;the time allowed for debating these important matters is to be severely restricted by the guillotine. I regard it as being very unsatisfactory indeed. It seems to be commonly the case now under this Government that very important measures are simply not considered adequately by the House of Representatives. The endangered species legislation will probably get only about an hour's debate next week. For a measure of that importance, it is outrageous, and I would like to put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have some concern over one aspect of the Madrid Protocol and the Government's actions in relation to that&mdash;the matter of the sledge dogs, the huskies of the Mawson Base. I therefore move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its grave concern over the decision of the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to remove the Mawson Base huskies from their long term environment and to give them to a resort operator in the USA, and calls on the Minister to reverse this decision and follow the British example of allowing the dogs to live out their lives in the Antarctic".</PARA>
<PARA>That motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the Minister's actions on this matter. She agreed to this particular provision in the protocol that the dogs were to be removed by April 1994, and I will not go into the arguments as to whether that was absolutely essential in order to get the protocol signed. I doubt that it was, but we will pass over that. The question is: what is sensible in the situation? We have working dogs which have been in that particular environment for a very long time, and they are used to that environment. People who have worked with these animals have enormous affection for them. In speaking to people who have been in the Antarctic during the whole of the winter and carried out experiments during the summer months, one finds that they develop a bond with these animals which is very unusual. These animals in a number of cases have saved the lives of members of expeditions, and one hears quite moving stories of occasions when that has happened. So it is not surprising that people who have worked there feel passionately about the fate of these dogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening to them under the Minister's orders is that at this very moment, I understand, they are being transported by helicopter to the supply ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> to be brought back to Hobart and thence put on a plane to Minnesota to be given to a resort operator in the United States. This has outraged those who have worked with these dogs. The polar sledge dog support group that has been set up in Australia has been arguing against this treatment of the dogs. It believes, and I agree with it, that the British move to stop the dogs from breeding in the British base and to let them stay there for the rest of their lives in their normal environment is a humane way of dealing with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British do not believe that is in any way a breach of the Madrid Protocol. I see absolutely no reason why we cannot do that. But if it is not possible, surely the dogs could be brought back to Australia. There are apparently a couple of potential places where they might go. During the debate I understand that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) will be drawing attention to other potential sites where the dogs might go if they must leave the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply cannot find out why these Victorian sites have not been selected by the Minister. We do not see why the dogs have to be given to a tour operator in the United States. People here regard that as a loss of part of Australia's Antarctic heritage. It is peculiar, given the Australian Veterinary Association's approval of the placing of the dogs in Victoria, that the Minister cannot, even at this late stage, change those arrangements. I have put a number of questions on notice to try to determine from the Minister whether she actually has a formal contract with these prospective USA owners, whether she has the approval of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) prior to disposing of what is effectively an Australian asset, and also why people in Victoria who were promised consideration as a venue for the dogs have apparently been bypassed. A whole lot of questions are unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this very late stage&mdash;I understand that the ship is virtually at the Mawson Base or just out from it&mdash;I understand that the weather is too bad for the dogs to be transported to the ship on the surface and they are being helicoptered out. The conditions under which they will travel on the ship are subject to some question as to whether they will be exposed to cold sea water and whether proper arrangements have been made with regard to their health on that voyage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is still time for the Minister&mdash;even if she persists in removing them from the Antarctic, which I think is disgraceful&mdash;to, at the very least, keep them on the Australian mainland. In Minnesota they certainly will not live in an environment anywhere near what they would have in the Antarctic. In parts of Victoria there might not be the winter snow of the kind that they get in Minnesota, but the summer temperatures would be very similar. This is just one of those very peculiar things that this Minister keeps doing. In every undertaking in which she is involved there is always some kind of bungle or peculiar or stubborn activity. I urge the Minister, even at this very late stage, to change that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we support the Bill over all. We wish to divide on our second reading amendment to make our point about the fate of the huskies. But I make it clear that the Bill as a whole is in line with the policy which we suggested originally and which was taken up by the Government. It is in line with the actions of coalition governments in the past&mdash;for example, the Menzies Government in 1959 in entering into the treaty; and the Fraser Government in 1980 in bringing down the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic (Environment Protection) Legislation Amendment Bill will amend the Antarctic Treaty Act 1980 to give the force of law in Australia to obligations arising from the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The protocol provides for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and includes a prohibition on mining. The opportunity is also being taken to make a number of other minor amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most recent significant developments in the Antarctic Treaty system was the adoption in 1991 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Negotiation of the protocol was a consequence of the Government's decision in May 1989 that Australia would not sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention, but would instead propose a comprehensive environment protection regime which prohibited mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adoption of the protocol shows that nations are prepared to protect the Antarctic environment. Implementing the protocol's provisions will involve additional costs and effort on the part of those active in Antarctica, including effort directed at monitoring changes in the global environment as indicated by changes in the Antarctic atmosphere and ice sheet and monitoring of the effects of activities in the Antarctic itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, we may ask, are we in Australia concerned about Antarctica? We are concerned because in this very exploited  world one part should be left in its pristine state, not only for this generation but also for future generations. As someone who has visited Antarctica and seen it and our Australian Antarctic operations at first-hand, I believe that efforts to protect Antarctica are important for both the continent itself and for mankind. I am particularly pleased that this legislation prohibits mining in Antarctica. There are many arguments against mining in Antarctica, not least the economic argument. I do not believe that the economics would stand close scrutiny. One has only to consider the tremendous infrastructure that would be required, the harsh and changeable weather, and transport difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, prior to completion of the negotiations, Australia introduced legislation to prohibit mining in the Antarctic and was among the first countries to do so. It was also among the first countries to sign the Madrid Protocol on 4 October 1991&mdash;the day it was opened for signature. Australia already has in place stringent environmental protection measures. This legislation provides for additional measures which are required under the protocol. Passage of this legislation and the making of regulations will enable Australia to ratify the protocol. Once again, we will be one of the first countries to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are we protecting Antarctica, but also we are seeking to understand it. Australia has a long and proud record in Antarctic research and currently has in place a wide range of scientific programs which include glaciology, space and atmospheric physics, and marine biology programs. The marine science program is conducted from one of the world's most advanced polar research ships, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS>. Australia's concern for the environmental aspects of the Antarctic is reflected in its current science program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, in a world dominated by conflicts and of competing and conflicting ideologies and philosophies, long before there was international cooperation in other spheres there was cooperation on Antarctica. Antarctica is the last clean place of any size left on earth. How long it can stay that way is questionable because there will most likely be increasing numbers of tourists, ships, garbage and pollution in general. Already there are elements of pollution there. I pay tribute to the clean-up measures of the Australian Government at our Mawson, Davis, Casey and Law bases in Antarctica. I believe our record in Antarctica is second to none. When I was in Antarctica, as well as visiting the Australian bases, I visited the Chinese and Soviet bases. Our protection of the Antarctic environment was better than that practised at these bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe future generations will look on this legislation as one of the most important&mdash;if not the most important&mdash;environmental legislation that this Labor Government has put in place. I thought the honourable member for Mr Mackellar (Mr Carlton) was a little unkind. I think in every debate about Antarctica in this chamber in which I have participated we have had very wide ranging support. Most of the people who speak in these debates have been to Antarctica and, regardless of our political affiliations, we come back committed to Antarctica and its protection. I do not think this Government has ever claimed the monopoly on Antarctica. We happened to be in power when some of this legislation was brought forward. Like in Antarctica itself, there is tremendous bipartisan support in this chamber for the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has had a proud record in Antarctica. It has not always been a stand which has been supported by other countries, and for some time Australia and France stood isolated on the question of protection of Antarctica. But our stand has been vindicated, as over the last few years we have seen support from other countries. Antarctic science is of global importance in describing, understanding, monitoring and predicting changes affecting the entire globe. It is also vital in analysing and modelling a variety of processes and systems which can be studied better in the Antarctic than in other regions, and in providing the basic knowledge necessary for conservation and management of our global resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I came into the chamber today I was preparing my speech and I was unaware of the speech made earlier by the honourable member for Mackellar. I had written: I welcome this legislation, but one aspect of it saddens me, and that is clause 2(2), which relates to the keeping of dogs in Antarctica. Whilst I fully understand that the keeping of the dogs is prohibited by the Madrid Protocol, the Australian huskies have served Australia well. They have been only at Mawson and for many years have been an integral part of that base. For anyone who has visited Mawson base, a visit to the dogline is one of the highlights of the time spent there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to the winterers there and they have told me that often, when they are out of sorts with all the other members of the team at that base, one place where they can always find a friend is at the dogline. As I say, a visit to the dogline is always one of the highlights even if one is only a short time visitor at Mawson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the work that the dogs have done over the past few years has now been replaced by sophisticated motorised vehicles, but I suggest that no motorised vehicle can show the affection, or indeed admiration, of a Mawson husky. Like thousands of other Australians, I am sad that we are to lose this rich part of our Antarctic history. The huskies of Mawson played their part in Australia's involvement in Antarctica and I think that all of us should remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Antarctic region is valuable to the people on earth because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve in as pristine a state as possible one of the few areas on earth not spoilt by man. This, I suggest, is not too high a price to pay, and the scientific and environmental integrity of the Antarctic is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity or in the name of dubious short term enrichment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Antarctica is without doubt the world's greatest wilderness. This vast land and its surrounding seas are dominated by nature, by cold and wind, ice and snow. The continent itself is barren. In fact, it is the driest continent on earth and Antarctic wildlife depends for its survival on food from the oceans. Human beings can exist there, but only with outside support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a place, many countries have decided to establish bases from which people can live and work. They have done this for many reasons, but the predominant reason is the desire for understanding. Antarctic research has brought new life to great questions about the earth, about its geophysics, its geologies, its ecosystems, its atmosphere and its place in the universe. It has also provided the world with an unprecedented opportunity for cooperation between the people of many nations in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge. The Antarctic region is valuable because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to scientists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve the Antarctic in as pristine a state as possible. This is not too high a price to pay. The scientific and environmental integrity of Antarctica is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism that the Madrid Protocol lasts for only 50 years and will then be renegotiated but, given the difficulty that has been experienced in reaching that agreement, the fact that it does last for 50 years and will be re-examined at the end of that period is a significant step forward. I think the wonderful thing about Antarctica is that, whatever nations the scientists come from, they always work together and cooperate. This shows that, when there is an overriding purpose, people can cooperate. If only we had the example of cooperation that we see in Antarctica in other spheres of life, maybe it would be a better world in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on earth have mined, farmed and raped much of the world. We have done tremendous damage to this planet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the Antarctic (Environment Protection) Legislation Amendment Bill, but I draw to the attention of the House the incompetence of the Government and of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). This is a very important Bill. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), indicated a degree of bipartisan support for the Bill, but the situation is that the Bill has been guillotined. Those honourable members on this side of the House who have some strong views to express are being restrained and we will cooperate to ensure that there is a broad range of views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill ratifies the Madrid Protocol signed on 4 October 1991, particularly in relation to Antarctica, which is the last pristine area in the world. There are no people living there permanently. The natural fauna, flora and wildlife are able to exist in that climate, and all members of this House would be keen to protect that arrangement. However, we on this side of the chamber are concerned about the issue of the removal of the dogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all honourable members would be aware, since 1936 Australia has claimed about 42 per cent of the area and has had a presence in the Antarctic region by way of scientific survey and to make sure that the area Australia claims is identified, and also that we act in a responsible manner. Australia has had research stations there since 1947 and generally there has been a long tradition of involvement by the Australian Government in Antarctica for the benefit of science and to maintain that environment in the best possible order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in this whole argument about the removal of the husky dogs, the protocol convention quite clearly states that there is no need to remove the dogs until April 1994. As the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), quite clearly indicated yesterday, and even today, there are moves afoot for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> to remove the dogs from the Australian bases but, as I understand it from information I received last night, bad weather is restraining this removal and the dogs may have to be flown out by helicopter to get them on to that boat. Great Britain has said that it does not regard the removal of its 20 dogs by April next year as an essential prerequisite for its operation in the Antarctica. On 20 October 1992, the London <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Britain refuses, on the grounds that Antarctica has been the home for four generations of huskies since 1945, and that they should be allowed to stay there until they die out from old age . . . This should be by 1998 at the latest.</PARA>
<PARA>I note in any case that the protocol may not have been ratified by all parties, and that is a matter which I think has been overlooked by the Minister. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who completed the first transpolar expedition in 1958, on 22 September 1991, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Observer</EMPHASIS> was reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They say huskies spread disease. Rubbish. It's the other way round. You have to stop them from picking up germs from seals and other animals.</PARA>
<PARA>Robert Headland of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, England, on the same day in relation to the removal of huskies, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision has no logic. Huskies are bred purely from Antarctic stock. No huskies have been introduced for decades. If there is a virus causing disease, we would have seen its effects.</PARA>
<PARA>As other members have said, the history of the dogs is very much part of the South Pole tradition, both in the Australian context and in the British context. The dog teams have been in economic operation, they have been environmentally friendly and, as I said, they have been very much part of the whole historic tradition of the way in which the South Pole has been explored and used in scientific surveys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discussed these matters in some detail with my brother, Alistair McArthur, who, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, had the privilege and honour of being a base commander in Antarctica under the direction of Sir Vivian Fuchs. We have discussed the very great impact of these dogs both personally and in terms of the way in which the dog teams were able to take part in scientific surveys in that continent under the direction of the British. The British maintained dog teams long after some of the other nations in the south brought in motorised operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also discussed these matters in some depth with Mr Gary Poole of Derrinallum in western Victoria. He spent one winter and two summers down south and came to understand and appreciate the whole environment. He is one of the many people in Australia who support the argument that the dogs be allowed to see out their natural life in the South Pole and that some greater sense should be brought to the debate about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both my brother and Mr Poole confirmed that the dogs are very good on thin ice, and that they are able to detect that very dangerous situation on scientific surveys when it is possible to fall into a crevasse and disappear. I understand that there are about 30 dogs down there at the base. Those gentlemen have confirmed that the dog teams have been very much better for the environment than modern motorised transport. The dogs have a working life of some seven years and, as the British are saying, they are bred in a continuous program in that environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the House the comparison between dog teams and motorised transport. I understand that two Haaglund transports worth $200,000 each have been destroyed during surveys. I wonder what the effect on the environment might be and, of course, what the maintenance and fuel costs of these particular items are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister drew the attention of the House to the Australian Veterinary Association and its comments about huskies. The Association has been actively involved in reviewing the protocols for the importation of Antarctic huskies to Australia and their subsequent export to Minnesota. The AVA now believes that the retaining of the huskies in Antarctica will be `in the best interests of their continued health and well-being'. Yet the Minister has refused to listen to the concerns of the AVA. In fact, this is not the first time the AVA has raised the issue. Earlier this year <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AVA News</EMPHASIS> carried an article by Mr Moonie, President of the ACT branch of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions Club. Mr Moonie reminded readers that the then Federal environment Minister, Senator Graham Richardson, in 1988 agreed with the findings of the Antarctica environmental committee that there was no evidence to support the removal of the Mawson huskies. As Mr Moonie pointed out, the protocol does not come into force until all nations have ratified it and that the 28 consultative nations will probably take five years to do so. The Minister has said that so far only Spain has ratified this protocol. In a reply in the next issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AVA News</EMPHASIS> the Minister said, in relation to the relocation of the dogs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . factors being taken into account include climate.</PARA>
<PARA>How can the Minister take into account the climate of Minnesota, USA, when we are talking about relocating dogs? How could one equate a Minnesota summer to possibly better environmental conditions here in Victoria, or to in fact allowing the dogs to see out their natural lives in Antarctica?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, today helicopters are being used to implement the Minister's decision. These helicopters cost $1,000 per hour to operate. Because of bad weather the Minister is using the helicopters to move the dogs from their location so they can be put on a boat and shifted to America. What a remarkable situation!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that kennels are available in the territory of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and in Ballarat and that they would be happy to take these huskies. This would keep them in Australia, and they would be looked after in a humane and sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the pressures of time, I would like to conclude my remarks by saying that in my view the Minister has not listened to the sensible views of those people closest to Antarctica, of those people who have had some hands-on experience, of those people who have an emotional connection with the huskies and of those people who have had long experience in the way in which the huskies have operated. As I say, the huskies are part of our tradition, and the Minister's decision has forced the dogs to be moved to an unnatural environment in America for commercial purposes, so they can be exploited by some kennel operator in Minnesota rather than being allowed to see out the term of their natural lives in that southern region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask why in fact this has to be when, with a sensible, commonsense view, the Minister could agree to these huskies remaining in Antarctica until 1994. If sense prevailed, it could be argued quite strongly that 30 huskies on Mawson station in Australia's territory would be much more environmentally friendly than motorised transport. I ask the Minister to reconsider her position. I hope that she will answer in some detail the questions by the shadow Minister as to what decisions have been taken before. I understand that the Minister and the administration have not been forthcoming with answers to a great number of people with personal interest in the welfare of these dogs and the way in which Antarctica might operate. </PARA>

You land them in Los Angeles at your expense and I will fly them from Los Angeles up to Minnesota'.

What is the cost of removing the huskies, particularly with this expedited timetable? How much of that cost is being met by the operator? We are not being told any of this. Is this open government? This is a serious decision affecting Australia's heritage. We are operating in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the dogs have to be removed from Antarctica, why are they going to America? There are alternatives in Australia. The official line from the Government is that it is in the best interests of the dogs to go to Minnesota, basically for two reasons: there is snow and they can pull sleds. In actual fact, when we look at what is being offered in Australia, those criteria can largely be met.

All of these matters are probably relevant in debates in this House, but when it comes down to talking about the most pristine, magnificent and beautiful area left in the world today, we need to be as bipartisan as possible about this whole area in the final outcome. I am not suggesting that either party on either side has any less desire along those lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to meet Australia's obligations under the Madrid Protocol prior to ratification. I regret that I have to speed up a bit due to the fact that the time allocated to this very important Bill has been dramatically reduced by the guillotine, as has the endangered species legislation, which is very important legislation. I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who is at the table, is not happy&mdash;at least I hope she is not&mdash;that these Bills have been cut back because they cover vital issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation involves three very critical concepts: fragility, interconnectiveness and human stewardship. I will not be able to enlarge on them at all. Human stewardship is perhaps the key point in the debate on the amendment today, however short the period might be. I bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that there has still been no response to the very detailed and excellent report tabled on 31 May 1989 by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism in Antarctica</EMPHASIS>, which touches on a number of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for environmental impact assessment in the Antarctic, a new system of protected areas in the Antarctic, greater protection of Antarctic fauna and flora and their habitat, the making of regulations providing for environmental impact procedures and waste management and waste disposal. We need to take into account that, whilst there are a lot of important areas of consideration, the scientific work that is being done down there has come in for some criticism. Even though we are talking about tourism in the Antarctic, the preservation of species and things like that, according to some articles I read recently, the activities of scientists in the Antarctic and the results of their work in some areas has been causing concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the privilege of going to the Antarctic, as did the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and others. I was going to go and it was one of the great disappointments of my life that, at the last minute, I could not. The former member for Maranoa went instead. Those who have come back have emphasised the tremendous need for governments, citizens and communities to become deeply involved and concerned with the need to protect the last great pristine piece of environment in the world. No other place in the world matches in any way, shape or form the excellence and the pristine environment that we have in the Antarctic.  Australia has a tremendous role to play in protecting that environment. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to implement the Government's decision in the `One Nation, One Job' economic statement in February to further liberalise the entry of foreign banks into Australia. It also makes a number of other significant changes to the various pieces of banking legislation to facilitate foreign bank entry and to enhance Reserve Bank prudential supervision of the Australian financial system. The Bill provides for the removal of restrictions on the entry of foreign banks into Australia, so there will now be no formal limit to the number of foreign banks allowed to operate here, although Reserve Bank approval will still be needed. There will be no time limit within which applications for banking authorities will need to be made, so there will now be virtually continuous freedom of entry for foreign banks into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also allow foreign banks authorised under the Banking Act to operate as wholesale banks in the form of a branch. This is a change from the current arrangements which require foreign banks to be incorporated locally as subsidiaries of the parent bank. Because a branch of a foreign bank cannot be subject to the same degree of prudential supervision as a subsidiary, foreign bank branches will be restricted to wholesale banking operations. If a foreign bank wants to conduct retail banking operations in Australia it must continue to be incorporated locally as a subsidiary. The Bill makes changes to the Banking Act to highlight the fact that depositors with foreign bank branches will not be subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the creation of a second Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank to assist with the Reserve Bank's prudential supervision of the banking system. The new Deputy Governor will be known as the Supervisor of Banks and will chair the new Council of Financial Supervisors which will consist of the Reserve Bank, the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures to permit the entry of more foreign banks into Australia represent a long overdue continuation of the deregulation of the financial system which began in 1983. In 1985, some 16 foreign bank licences were issued, which first enabled foreign banks to operate in Australia as incorporated subsidiaries. Since that time the Government has steadfastly refused to allow further entry of foreign banks into Australia, despite the boost to the competitiveness of the Australian financial system that could be expected to flow from the addition of more foreign banks to the Australian marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely understood that the limited and controlled entry of foreign banks into Australia from 1985 has injected only a limited amount of extra competition into the Australian financial system. The Government has now finally relented on further foreign bank entry and a significant number of foreign banks have already expressed an interest in commencing branch operations here. This includes existing foreign banks operating here as subsidiaries, as well as potential new entrants. It should be noted, however, that there are still a number of obstacles in the way of foreign banks that want to obtain a competitive position in the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although offshore banking legislation is currently before the Parliament, there are still a large number of outstanding taxation issues to be settled which affect the operations of foreign banks in Australia. The Government and the Australian Taxation Office have been slow in addressing these issues and in responding to industry concerns. Foreign banks are potentially at a disadvantage when converting existing subsidiaries in Australia into branches because the existing law does not allow them to carry forward losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some $2 billion in accumulated losses has been notched up over the past three years or so by foreign banks in Australia and so taxation and other legislation to facilitate the conversion of those losses to operations with branch status is clearly of enormous importance to bankers considering that step. The Government announced in June that the necessary legislation would be forthcoming. However, it appears that such legislation will not emerge until the end of this year and, even then, it is likely to be in draft form only. The necessary and proposed legislation is therefore unlikely to be debated until the autumn session of Parliament next year, and obviously risks being caught up in the calling of the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, then, that if the Government wants to facilitate the entry of foreign banks into Australia, it is going to have to fast track that legislation or risk generating a great deal of uncertainty for both potential and new entrants and the existing subsidiaries wanting to convert to branch status. The difficulty that arises, of course, is that this is very complex legislation, dealing with a range of complicated tax issues. It is likely that proposed legislation will also seek to integrate the existing banking and related tax legislation into one Act, which will make it a crucial Bill for Australia's financial sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexities of relevant legislation necessarily limit the rate of progress, but the point should be made that the Government has been painfully slow in recognising the need to introduce these measures. Between 1985 and the beginning of this year, very little was done to further deregulate our financial market to facilitate the operations of foreign banks or offshore financial transactions. This is despite the increasingly widespread recognition that Australia is extremely well placed to become a major regional financial centre. If the Government had made an earlier start in this matter we would not be facing some of the delays and difficulties that confront the Government today in putting together the necessary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the outstanding taxation issues that are threatening to cause problems for foreign banks in Australia. The Reserve Bank is also erecting its share of hurdles for the new entrants. The costs of compliance with Reserve Bank requirements or foreign banks are considerable and serve to undermine the competitiveness of those banks in the Australian market. These costs also reduce the level of interest in conducting financial transactions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of regulations and oversight arrangements that foreign banks must meet in order to be able to operate here. For example, there is a Reserve Bank requirement that licensed banks in Australia be required to hold one per cent of all liabilities, other than shareholders' funds, with the Reserve Bank. These non-callable deposits amount to an entry or licence fee for the foreign banks and attract a paltry interest rate from the Reserve Bank. The problem with many of these regulatory and prudential supervisory arrangements is that they often duplicate measures operating in the home countries of the foreign banks requiring the foreign banks to jump through two sets of hoops in order to operate here. The convergence of prudential standards around the world under a number of international agreements should obviate the need for the Reserve Bank to excessively regulate foreign bank operations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a major increase in the regulatory burden forced upon financial institutions by the Reserve Bank in recent times, largely as a response to the irresponsible borrowing and lending by some financial institutions which took place in the 1980s. It is ironic that these events of the 1980s should lead to increased regulation by the Reserve Bank since it was arguably the Reserve Bank, through the excessive liquidity growth it allowed to take place during the 1980s, that was largely responsible for the borrowing and lending activities of the time. That excess liquidity growth was highly inflationary and led to the asset price spiral that was brought rapidly unstuck when the Government slammed on the monetary policy brakes towards the end of the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank responsible for financial institutions complains, as he does in the most recent Reserve Bank bulletin, that the 1980s became a period of excessively rapid growth in financial intermediation and in asset prices, we have a bad case of the pot calling the kettle black. It can be argued that if we had a more independent Reserve Bank that was focused on price stability instead of doing the Government's bidding in manipulating the business cycle, we would have less need for prudential supervision of financial institutions since business would not be vulnerable to the boom and bust policies of governments that insist on manipulating monetary policy for political ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also be mindful of the cautionary note sounded by the retiring Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr John Phillips, on the cost of prudential supervision. Mr Phillips reminds us that prudential supervision is not cost free. Such costs, if they are incurred by the financial institutions, are passed on to their customers. If they are incurred by the Government, they are paid for by taxpayers. It is all very well for us to say that there should be more prudential supervision of financial institutions in Australia, but the costs of such supervision must be measured against the benefits. Those benefits can be difficult to quantify, even more so than the costs, since they are systemic in nature, deigned as they are to protect the banking system as a whole as much as to address the specific problems faced by the particular financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, some things that prudential supervision cannot guard against, such as financial institutions making bad loans or bad decisions. We should not kid ourselves that the arrangements we are putting in place now will stop many of the things that happened in the 1980s, whatever the ultimate causes of those circumstances might have been. We should not encourage depositors to abrogate all responsibility for exercising their own prudential supervision and making their own judgments as to the viability of the financial institutions with which they have dealings. The information problems in this regard are often exaggerated and more attention needs to be paid by the clients of financial institutions to the sort of information provided by the various ratings agencies as a part of their commercial decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also bear it in mind that some people might actually prefer to utilise high risk financial intermediaries in return for cheaper financial services or a higher rate of return on their assets. This is a rational part of any large and well-managed portfolio and we should not be imposing our value judgments on people who may have a real commercial need for high risk and high return financial intermediation. We have a related difficulty, which is the ridiculous situation under this Bill whereby foreign banks that convert to branch status and new entrants which commence operations as branches will be confined to wholesale operations because branches of foreign banks cannot be subject to the same degree of depositor protection. This will be achieved by instituting a threshold initial deposit of $250,000, above which branches will be able to accept funds from any sources. With such a high threshold, there will be very few such deposits from households and there will be little by way of retail banking under these distortionary arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Graham Thompson, the reasoning behind this decision is that the decision to restrict branches in their deposit raising from the retail sector stems from the Government's view that the savings of average household depositors should continue to be subject to depositor protection by the Australian authorities. These depositors would also, generally speaking, be less able to make well-informed judgments about the relative merits of dealing with a branch or a locally incorporated bank. That suggests that Australians need to be treated like children in relation to retail banking by foreign banks and cannot be trusted to make their own assessment as to the implications of the lack of depositor protection for foreign bank branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arguably, it should be none of the Commonwealth's business what people do with their money in this context. It does not say much about our maturity as a nation or our ability to act as a major provider of financial services that we take such a dim view of the average retail banking client. It is ironic that this distortion should be introduced into the operations of foreign bank branches, because one of the principal rationales for granting entry to foreign banks under this Bill is the lack of a major impact on retail banking by the existing foreign banks in Australia. This is typified by the well known case of the foreign bank in Sydney that has a sign out front saying, `No cash kept on these premises'. Many of the new foreign banks will not be interested in retail banking, but this Bill will not even provide the option to foreign bank branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, and Sydney in particular, is well placed to become a major regional financial centre, and we should be making every effort to ensure that it comes about. The provision of financial services promises to be a high growth industry in the Asia-Pacific region over many years to come. The economies of the Asia-Pacific region are not only growing at a rapid rate but also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their financial needs. The demand for skilled financial services within the region will thus grow in line with the already strong economic growth rates within the region. Australia has a very good skills base in financial services and our financial sector is generally very competitive. We also have a number of distinct advantages over other major regional financial centres that, combined, make Australia an attractive place to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have the high overhead costs associated with operations in Tokyo or Singapore, nor do we have the political uncertainty that presently clouds the future of Hong Kong. Australia is well located in terms of international time zones and has an advanced legal system and highly developed financial markets, including, after Tokyo, the region's leading financial futures market. The only major drawback from which Australia suffers is what Mr Vic Alexander, Chairman of the Australian Financial Centre Committee, has called `our Neanderthal tax structure', although some progress has been made on that front since that comment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that any tax concessions granted to encourage a greater share of the region's financial transactions through Australian markets and Australian-based financial institutions will more than repay the revenue over the longer term. That will be because of the increased level of economic activity that financial markets will bring to Australia, which will generally be taxed at the company tax rate of 39 per cent or at the various, typically high, personal income tax rates. So there is no excuse for Australia not becoming a major financial centre in the years ahead. We will have only ourselves to blame if we fail to capitalise on our distinct comparative advantage in the provision of financial services to the rest of the world and to Asia in particular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How delighted I am to hear a member of the Opposition speaking in such glowing terms about the possibilities for Australia developing as a financial services centre, particularly flowing from the legislation which the Government has introduced today and the legislation which was debated yesterday on the OBU legislation. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is 100 per cent correct when he says that there is an opportunity for Australia now, that we must seize it with both hands and that we must take advantage of those very distinct comparative advantages that Australia enjoys. He listed most of them and there are probably some others. I would just hope that those people in government who are looking at this&mdash;and I am certainly doing my best to facilitate that&mdash;will take into consideration the very detailed reports that have come from Mr Alexander's committee, from Price Waterhouse, from the New South Wales State Government and from others. I am talking particularly about some of the other issues which go to taxation and other matters, because I think they are relevant. We should not lose the opportunity now to proceed in developing Australia as a major financial services centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that we are dealing with is particularly relevant to foreign bank entry into Australia. The honourable member for Curtin in his commentary indicated that, largely as a result of decisions taken in the early 1980s, we saw a more liberalised regime in our banking system. Foreign banks were given licences, albeit a limited number&mdash;16 licences were issued and only 15 were taken up&mdash;and, interestingly, at the time those foreign bank licences were given, they were given on the basis that those banks were supposed to establish a retail banking network. The concern of the Government at the time, after a couple of reviews, was that the big four banks in Australia needed to be subjected to further competition. It was felt that, by giving a limited number of foreign bank licences so that other banks could come into Australia, that opportunity for improved competition would be granted: the foreign banks, with the resources that they would have behind them, would get into the comparative areas and offer benefits to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of that equation was that, when we allowed those 16 foreign banks to come in, we said they had to be incorporated as subsidiaries and not operate as branches. The fallacy of that was that it limited the supply of capital which the Australian subsidiaries of those major banks had. Therefore, to think that they could compete against NAB, the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ANZ was at the time misdirected enthusiasm on the part of those who made the recommendations. Interestingly, following on from that was the need then to review those decisions. I was pleased to chair the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which did that. I would just remind the House that that inquiry&mdash;the banking inquiry, as it was referred to&mdash;tabled its report in this place in November last year. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>. We made some substantial recommendations&mdash;103 in total&mdash;to improve, in our view, the banking system as it presently operates in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am therefore very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation today. It is from this report and the recommendations contained therein that this legislation has emanated. I think that says a couple of things. Firstly, it says that this Parliament, through its committee system, with a bipartisan report&mdash;as this one is&mdash;can bring down recommendations which the Government can then act upon. In this case the Government has said, `Well, all right, we made a mistake in the mid-1980s and issued only 16 banking licences for foreign banks. Let's redress that situation based on the weight of evidence that has come from a parliamentary inquiry and let's change it.'. In fact, recommendation 10 said that there should be a removal of the formal limitation on the number of licences issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made that recommendation not so much because it thought there would be a major flood of new entrants coming into the market&mdash;because economic circumstances perhaps are not right for that&mdash;but because some of the entrants that are already here, and those entrants that the honourable member for Curtin referred to that have sustained considerable losses since they have been operating in Australia, may in fact choose to go from Australia, to exit the market now, but to come back again in the future when things improve. That is one option that might be available. That is not to say that we do not want them here, but it certainly provides them with that ease of entrance and exit which we presently do not enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those 16 licences were available, it almost became an option; it almost became a selling point that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity for foreign banks to get into Australia. Of course, as we have seen, that was to the detriment of those banks, simply because when the four major Australian banks saw them coming they decided, `Well, we are not going to allow this to happen. They have to have retailing; we are not going to let that happen either'. So they really started to market themselves. The end result was that they ended up with 75 per cent of the retail banking in this country and the rest of it went to the non-bank financial intermediary sector or to the State banks. It is interesting, therefore, that as time has gone on, as we have had a chance to reflect on financial deregulation in Australia, we have seen a need to change the approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, recommendation 10 of the Committee's report, that the formal limitation be removed, has now been adopted. Recommendation 11 was a corollary of that. The report suggested that foreign banks should be located in Australia as subsidiaries rather than branches, and that also was adopted by the Government. As we have seen, the Government has now moved to enable these foreign banks to come in as branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Wilson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend and colleague the honourable member for Sturt, who was Deputy Chairman of the inquiry, rightly points out, but not in retailing. I will address that issue. Like he, I probably would have preferred to see it go the full way in terms of both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Wilson interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As he is again interjecting and rightly reminding me, we in fact recommended that very thing. But the point is that recommendation 11, on branching not subsidiaries, is an issue which I think is worthy of a deal of consideration. The branching structure as proposed in our report was put forward on the basis that we would have a much more substantial volume of funding available to the foreign banks, so that if we were looking at real competition against existing Australian banks those foreign banks would provide that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided that it will apply that only in wholesale banking. To some extent and upon reflection, some of the arguments can be seen as to why that is the case. For example, as I have already illustrated, when the original licences were given it was expected that retailing would be part of the foreign banks' operations in this country. One or maybe two tried to do that by getting involved with an arrangement with an Australian bank, but all of them failed. In fact, only one foreign bank&mdash;and there is some criticism as to whether it is even a bank&mdash;in this country actually made any money out of the deal in the last five years. So whether or not it is wholesale or retail now is a moot point and can be debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations that came from our Committee inquiry have been acted on and have already been referred to in debate this afternoon. Recommendation 34 suggested that a second Deputy Governor be appointed principally and solely to be involved with prudential supervision. Recommendation 38 referred to the need for the establishment of a Council of Financial Supervisors so that prudential supervision amongst all financial intermediaries within Australia&mdash;the banking sector and the non-bank financial intermediary areas dealing with building societies, credit unions and so on&mdash;would all have some common basis of supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly concerned, as, I am sure, are most Australians, about the apparent losses&mdash;indeed, what has been proven to be substantial losses&mdash;incurred by major banks in this country as a result of decisions taken where perhaps prudential supervision was not up to the mark. I am not saying anything that I have not said in the past and which our Committee was somewhat critical of. The view that was expressed by the banking inquiry was that there was a need for a specific purpose Second Deputy Governor whose responsibility was to ensure that prudential standards and prudential supervisory regimes of accounting standards and auditing functions were put in place. We have moved to do that, and this recommendation has been acted upon and translated into legislation which is the subject of today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council of Financial Supervisors was equally important because we felt that within Australia, with so many financial organisations doing what essentially was banking business, there was a need to ensure that the Commissioner for Superannuation and Insurance, and the new AFIC organisation to supervise the building societies and credit unions, interplay with each other and with the Reserve Bank so that each of those organisations had an idea as to how the other was prudentially supervising financial institutions in this country. I take the view that a strong and dynamic financial sector of the Australian economy underpins our economic and social well-being. But to have confidence in that, we must have confidence in the ability of the supervisory regime that is in place to meet the needs of the system. The second Deputy Governor's position will go some way in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take into consideration other recommendations that we made, which this Deputy Governor presumably will put in place&mdash;such as having audit teams and flying squads, groups that would look at banks' accounts and perhaps do more than simply give a nod and a wink to bank administrators&mdash;we may not see the situation of the 1980s eventuate, where almost every bank in this country, in a lemming-like rush, attempted to buy overvalued assets. If the Reserve Bank and the other Council of Financial Supervisors members see, by examination of the books of their respective organisations, that there is an overcommitment in certain areas, then that nod and a wink might be taken a bit further and suggestions made to them that they should divest out of that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested in some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for Curtin. I basically agree with a lot of what he had to say. He was talking about the cost of prudential supervision and whether there were benefits. I think the obvious benefit of improving prudential supervision is having confidence in the safety and soundness of the Australian banking industry. If we do not have that, then we do not have a sound economy. I think, therefore, that if there is a cost to the banks or the participants who are in that system and they have to pay fees, charges or whatever it might be for prudential supervision, or if there is an indirect cost which is perhaps not measurable to the banks in having to conform with the guidelines that are established or, indeed, even having international standards in terms of capital adequacy ratios, then so be it. But it should be in their best interests as financial institutions in this country to have somebody watching over what they are doing&mdash;not regulating them, but supervising and giving them guidance. If some of that guidance were around in the 1980s, then perhaps the problems in Victoria with the State Bank and the problems in South Australia, which I am sure my friend the honourable member for Sturt will comment on in his contribution shortly, would not have eventuated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I anticipate you, my friend, because we have had long discussions about this over a number of years now. I guess that, at the end of the day, we would all want to see a stronger, more competitive financial sector in Australia where there is confidence generated by the supervisory regime so that as consumers, as customers of banks, building societies and credit unions, we know that if we put our money in them it is safe and protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of protection raises another matter. The honourable member for Curtin, in my view, hit the nail right on the head: each and every one of us should take responsibility for the decisions that we make about our financial affairs. If we are in a position where we recognise that prudential standards make our chosen bank, building society or credit union appropriate to meet our everyday needs&mdash;cheque accounts, credit cards and all the rest of it&mdash;then, provided we have access to appropriate information about the services being provided, the fees, charges and so on which each of those organisations levy on us, we should be responsible for our own activities, our own decisions based on that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we have not had the disastrous effect of the S&amp;Ls in the United States. In the United States early last year a major report was brought forward by the Government, by Secretary Brady, and given to the Parliament for examination, to its Senate and the House of Representatives banking committees. They took the report away and came down with completely different recommendations. When both Houses of Parliament got together to try to sort it out, the only thing they came down with was to plough in many more billions of dollars in the Deposit Insurance Corporation to buy out and to prop up those people whose loans had gone by the by because of the failures of the S&amp;Ls in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point which emerges from that&mdash;my friend the honourable member for Sturt and I have had quite a number of discussions about this very issue, and I will be surprised if he does not touch on it on the way through as well&mdash;is that, as individuals, we must be responsible for our own destiny, provided we have that information. We should not be dependent upon some pool of funds, because ultimately the customer will pay for that. If the bank, under a Deposit Insurance Corporation type arrangement in the United States, has to take money out of the system as a guarantee or some insurance that it is not going to go broke, what confidence do we have in the directors of that organisation to start with? If a person knows that someone is going to be gambling with his funds, I think he would find that to be an unpalatable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate supervisory regime that we have in place will protect the system. The cost of prudential supervision is something which cannot always be measured simply in the dollars and cents cost to the banks, because I think that there is something even more important and fundamental than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I hope this legislation, combined with the OBU legislation, will send appropriate signals to the international marketplace about this country's, and certainly this Government's, intention to see Australia flourish as a regional, financial services centre. This is an opportunity to attract regional headquarters of major overseas corporations to this country. They will know that the financial system is sound and safe, that the Parliament of Australia has made a positive contribution in developing this very important and significant inquiry report into the banking system through the committee process, and that the Government has acted in a responsible manner by bringing in legislation of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a significant part of the ongoing pattern of changing approach, where warranted, to financial deregulation in Australia. It does make us internationally competitive. It takes us to the forefront, I think, in the field of international finance. The legislation is something which I think should and will be carried by both sides of this House without any disquiet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that on 8 October this year the seventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors was held in France under the chairmanship of Gerald Corrigan, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I wonder whether our Reserve Bank had a senior representative at that conference; I hope it did. I have a doubt in my mind whether it would have regarded it as sufficiently significant, but time will tell, and we will no doubt find out in due course. In his opening remarks, Mr Corrigan said of bank supervisors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we cannot relax our surveillance, inspection and examination programs as they pertain to traditional concerns about asset quality and concentrations. For many supervisory authorities&mdash;certainly including the Federal Reserve&mdash;these dual concerns with new and old sources of problems will mean that still greater and more sophisticated resources&mdash;people and technology&mdash;will have to be devoted to the supervisory process. This will be costly but the alternative would be even more costly.</PARA>
<PARA>I bring that quote to the attention of my colleague on this side of the House who spoke a few moments ago, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and to the honourable member for Macarthur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supervision will be costly, but the lack of it will be far more expensive to taxpayers, to bank depositors and to the community at large. In the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the banking inquiry, we recommended that the Reserve Bank appoint a second Deputy Governor with specific responsibilities for prudential supervision. I was glad to hear the words of the honourable member for Macarthur when he emphasised that this would be the role of the second Deputy Governor. I am disappointed, however, that that role is not reflected in the words of the legislation. It is my view that this legislation creating the position of a second Deputy Governor should have legislatively specified that the second Deputy Governor was to be entitled the Supervisor of Banks, for only in that way will we sheet home the very heavy responsibility that we want the second Deputy Governor of the bank to shoulder. Until the legislation is appropriately amended&mdash;as I think it should be and hope it will be in the future&mdash;it will be up to this Parliament to constantly remind the Reserve Bank and its second Deputy Governor that his role is that of supervisor of banks. The responsibility that goes with that should be fully recognised by him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur and I have had some differences about the issue of deposit insurance. I will touch on that matter very briefly now because he creates a paradoxical situation. He says that the community must know that the banking system is sound and must be sure that it is safe. One of the great difficulties for bank supervisors is that, as they go in to supervise, they create what bankers call a `moral hazard'. There is a perception created in the public's mind that, because they are supervising, the bank is safe; the deposits are guaranteed. If honourable members go out into the streets of Wollongong and ask any person going into or coming out of a bank what that person believes about his or her bank deposits, I believe they will find a substantial majority of those depositors believe that those bank deposits are guaranteed. Yet the legislation makes it quite clear that there is no such guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank constantly reminded us during the inquiry that it did not guarantee bank deposits. It said that no depositors had lost their money. That is true: no depositor had under a regulated system. But depositors have lost it under a deregulated system, not as depositors but in their role as taxpayers in the State of South Australia, in the State of Victoria, and I guess right throughout the country because of the financial disasters of the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. That moral hazard creates a massive problem because in the next breath the honourable member for Macarthur says the customers should identify the weak banks and keep their deposits away from them and go to the strong banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, if the bank fails, what happens? My guess is that, if any Australian bank of any significance were to fail, this Parliament would have to do exactly the same thing for every deposit as the Congress of the United States had to do for American banks, and I distinguish American banks from the S&amp;Ls. Yet, in this country, when Pyramid went down, we did exactly the same in the State of Victoria for Pyramid as the Congress did for the S&amp;Ls. There is a parallel between those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold the view that to ensure some flexibility within the whole finance industry there needs to be a level of deposit insurance beyond which we let the buyer beware; below which there is a formal parliamentary Reserve Bank&mdash;either legal or de facto&mdash;guarantee because of the deposit system. We need to have confidence in the system. There is confidence at two main levels&mdash;the household level and the commercial business level. I am talking about the household level. Let the commercial level be judge as to which are the risky banks and which are the safe banks, but let the depositors of the households be sure that their household working balances are guaranteed. They can be guaranteed at the expense of the industry&mdash;at the expense indeed of the risky banks&mdash;if the system is structured correctly through an insurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a knee-jerk reaction when one talks about deposit insurance to say that it has failed in the United States. It has, because it has been structured wrongly, not because of the system itself. It is interesting to note that, in the developments that are going on in a unified Europe, the European banking system regards it as important to have as an integral part of that system a form of deposit insurance. It does not say that deposit insurance should replace supervision; rather, the reverse. It says that the supervision should be aided by an effective, sensible, well-structured system of deposit insurance. What has been happening in a deregulated market is that banks have taken on riskier and riskier portfolios. It has become more and more difficult for supervisors to ensure that no bank will ever fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the primary roles of a supervisor. The primary roles are, firstly, to ensure the safety of the financial system as a whole, and, secondly, to use best endeavours to protect deposits. I think it is absurd that these endeavours should be expected to preserve the deposits of a huge financial conglomerate which, instead of having its activities only over the banking area as previously, now has its activities into the finance company area, almost into the pawnbroker area, as well as into the securities industry and into insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absurd to expect that that could happen, and yet we need supervision throughout the finance industry. I am pleased that the Government at least has in mind that this second Deputy Governor should be chairman of the Council of Financial Supervisors. However, I am concerned that unless the Reserve Bank gets its act together and does a better job than it has done in the past and is pro-active in its leadership of the finance industry Supervisors Council, there will be a need for us to look yet again at the desirability of doing what the Canadians and many other countries do&mdash;that is, have a mega-supervisor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems in the world's finance industry today is its conglomeratisation and internationalisation. In both respects there are major cultural problems. With regard to the culture and language of the insurance industry supervisor, the securities industry supervisor and the banking supervisor, the words may be the same but they put different meanings to them. The culture and the language of the bankers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom may be the same&mdash;the words may be translated into French, German and English in the same way&mdash;but when they go home and seek to fulfil their obligations as expressed in that language they do totally different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Europe a few weeks ago I had discussions about this issue. There is very great concern in Europe about how to get cultural understanding so that bankers of different countries talk the same language and do the same thing in fulfilling the commitments they make to each other. Equally, how do supervisors of different sectors of the finance industry use the same language, make common commitments and then discharge those commitments in a common way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have a mishmash of unsatisfactory supervision. The role which is now to be that of the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank is to bring some order to it and, in bringing order to it, to give this Parliament and the people of this country the sorts of assurances that the honourable member for Macarthur was talking about so that we know that our financial system as a whole has an integrity, a safeness and a soundness about it. But unless the Reserve Bank adopts a totally new approach to the whole system we will experience some of the disasters which we have been experiencing in one or two of the States over the last two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about two main issues in the time available to me. One relates to the Basle Convention and the capital adequacy requirements. We in this country have assumed that the 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement is not only a minimum but also a maximum. That is a mistake and a total misunderstanding of the Basle Convention capital adequacy 8 per cent ratio rule. That 8 per cent rule was set for international banks. Not every member of the AFIC organisation who is being supervised by AFIC is an international bank. In fact, they are not banks at all. Why then is 8 per cent appropriate for AFIC? In Europe and the United Kingdom the capital adequacy requirement of many of their domestic banks and non-bank financial institutions is substantially higher than 8 per cent. We should draw no comfort from those bureaucrats and bankers who tell us that all our banks satisfy the 8 per cent rule. Many have imposed upon them minimums far in excess of the 8 per cent rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect about the 8 per cent is that the 8 per cent capital adequacy relates to, and was set in respect of, a bank's or financial institution's credit risk. One of the things that we are failing to do is recognise that there is a series of other risks in respect of which banks and similar institutions should have substantial capital adequacy requirements. They relate to the market risks&mdash;the risks of the open positions on traded debt, traded equities and open foreign exchange positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basle is now looking at that. We should be anticipating it and taking part in the Basle discussions. But we do not. We are in the OECD. We have a Treasury officer in Paris connected with our OECD delegation, but he is not a banker. Can he go along&mdash;has he the time to go along&mdash;to all the discussions in which the OECD is involved in relation to the setting of capital adequacy standards? Does he or our representative in Bonn always get the opportunity to go to Basle and take part in the Basle discussions? We are not officially a party to those discussions. The Canadians are because they are a member of the G10. We are at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if we want this country to become a regional financial centre we have to upgrade our involvement and participation in these discussions with regard to the finance industry in its international context. I think that is a matter of urgency and knowing of his concerns about this whole area, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take on board that view because dramatic things are happening in Europe and Basle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is close liaison between Basle and Brussels. There is an attempt to get a convergence of view as to the standards for capital adequacy which cover not only the credit risk but also the market risks to which I referred. But they then need to cover other risks such as the interest rate risk which was not previously regarded as something which should be backed up by a capital adequacy requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had time I would detail more fully how the capital adequacy requirement is now calculated. Essentially, it means that the bank must have shareholders' funds so that if it makes substantial losses it is the shareholders' funds that are used to wipe out those losses and not the depositors' funds. One could go on for quite a while if the time were available, but unfortunately it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also discussions in Europe between the securities industry and the bank supervisors to try to get a convergence of understanding. What is happening here? Are our supervisors in the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Australian Securities Commission getting together, learning a common language and learning how to apply a common approach? I do not believe this is happening. I think it is urgent that they do so, otherwise we will experience major losses of Australian household savings and long term savings as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn from that subject because I want to speak briefly about the action being taken to allow the State Bank of New South Wales to get a banking licence in order that the Reserve Bank can conduct prudential supervision in an enhanced way. Let us look at the Reserve Bank's success rate on supervision. Let us look at what the Tricontinental Royal Commission had to say about the ability, effectiveness and success of our Reserve Bank in its supervision in past times. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RBA should have been aware that its supervision of SBV was regarded by overseas authorities as well as the State Government and Australian financial circles as of real importance in providing reassurance that its prudential requirements were being observed. The fact that the arrangement with SBV was voluntary did not diminish the need to ensure that prudential standards were being maintained. The absence of constitutional authority may explain a diffident approach . . . but it does not excuse it.</PARA>
<PARA>But what we have here is a State bank getting a banking licence, with its deposits guaranteed. The Reserve Bank will not supervise that bank effectively because, if it went down, it would not destabilise the financial system of this country and no depositor would lose. Because of the guarantee of the deposits, it can supervise the bank by staying in the Reserve Bank headquarters and not looking at a paper or report from the State Bank of New South Wales. There needs to be a fundamental change in the Reserve Bank's reporting requirements, because it will excuse itself by saying the bank could not fail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments that are before the House this afternoon represent a very important reform of our banking system. They follow from the report of my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>. I certainly believe that the impetus that that report has given to significant change in the way the Government addresses banking issues and the way industry addresses banking and bank customer issues is of vital importance. If there were more time, I would take issue with the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) about two or three points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice it to say that these amendments do a number of things to enhance the supervisory capacities of the Reserve Bank. As a result of the parliamentary committee report, we recognise that there was a need for the Reserve Bank to be proactive in the area of prudential supervision. There was a need to recognise that deregulation was critical for the future expansion of the financial system and the economy of Australia but, at the same time, some of the supervision requirements needed to be updated much more vigorously with the growth of the financial services area, the blurring of the lines between banking business and non-banking business, the development of financial conglomerates and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way of doing that was to ensure first of all that the Reserve Bank enhanced its supervisory capacity. We made recommendations that the Government has picked in this legislation to appoint a second Deputy Governor to the Reserve Bank with direct responsibility for prudential supervision and to have a Council of Financial Supervisors to coordinate the range of supervisory officials across the financial sector and enhance the Reserve Bank's supervisory capacity on site in banks and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at models all over the world, but it is fair to say that the experience of the 1980s shows us that not one of those models is fail safe or without problems. Even allowing for the imperfections in the deposit insurance system in the United States that the honourable member for Sturt mentioned, there is precious little evidence, I suggest, to say that a change of that sort of itself will ensure the sort of prudential standards that are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides for the correction of one of the areas of weakness&mdash;that in relation to the State Bank of New South Wales. This measure is complementary to New South Wales legislation. It is an important Bill. We can relate back to all of the difficult experiences of the past with State banks and can sheet home the blame wherever we like. What matters is that there is this complementary arrangement; that there is the capacity for the Reserve Bank to be involved and to enhance its supervisory and prudential capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank has acknowledged the need to do that, and I think the capacity for vigilance and increased flexibility in that regard will be important. But not all of the responsibility for Tricontinental and all the rest can fairly be put at the feet of the Reserve Bank. Clearly that would be inappropriate. I am not suggesting that that is what was said by the honourable member for Sturt. The Reserve Bank does have an important responsibility in that regard. That much I endorse entirely. But equally there needs to be an acknowledgment on the part of all the supervisory agencies of their important role in ensuring to the satisfaction of the community the safety of funds that are held in whatever form of deposit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a constantly expanding and developing process. As the nature of the relationships in the financial sector changes, the need for the Reserve Bank and the other supervisors to change to meet those competing and new challenges will be greater, and that is fundamental. This legislation will provide the Reserve Bank with the capacity to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence, for instance, that just by going to a mega-supervisor in this sort of case we are going to achieve those objectives, or that just having the huge cost associated with something like the US Federal reserves or the in-house facility in every banking institution across the country is going to change the comparative safety of depositors' funds. There is no good evidence in history to support that particular line of thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does matter is that we enhance that supervisory capacity; that we ensure that there is coordination between the institutions. In particular, we must ensure that where there are subsidiaries of banks the same sorts of standards are applied in terms of capital adequacy and the safety of funds as are applied to the banks themselves that have the banking authority. We could draw a distinction in terms of capital adequacy, rather than saying that the threshold of capital adequacy that the existing banks have to meet is too low, but I am not sure that is the case in actual fact. But what I do stress is the importance of ensuring that all of the non-banking business cannot jeopardise what is done by those banking institutions carrying out traditional banking operations. There can be no increased risk because of those functions. I think that is going to be a far more significant issue. Even looking at what has happened up to now, it is the merchant banking arms and so forth that really have created most of the fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true to say that a lot of the State banks were ill prepared for the sorts of changes that occurred post-deregulation, and undertook expansionary processes that they just did not have the managerial capacity to deal with. Some of the responsibility must be put in that category. So the feature of the Bill that deals with prudential supervision is an important enhancement. As time goes on those matters need to be kept under constant review, and the need for vigilance to take account of the changing nature of our financial sector is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key changes in this particular package of amendments relate to the important decisions to enhance the competition that we do regard as critical for the Australian financial system. The further opening up of the system, with the foreign banks going into branching, will be important&mdash;again with the qualifications we have placed on it regarding supervision. These important supervisory functions do pose extra challenges for the Reserve Bank. Indeed, international banking is going to need to become more prudent in the way it goes about supervisory arrangements because of the internationalisation of the banking system, and the branching decision is an important one in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that foreign banks will not be in a straitjacket, they will have the options of coming and going. Some will grasp those opportunities, I am sure. There is significant interest in this issue. We have had the added protection built into the arrangements from a prudential standpoint of ensuring that the arrangements for branching relate to wholesale banking. That should be an important protection for our banking system. But, again, it does highlight the need for the Reserve Bank to develop systems and to have a pro-active role in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further points that are important in the Bill relating to foreign banking come back to the issues that the honourable member for Macarthur was talking about earlier. The capacity for Australia to really get the full value out of the reforms in financial services relates to our capacity to develop as a regional financial headquarters and to our capacity to develop offshore banking units that are competitive. We have to ensure that the increasing focus that most of these areas share in terms of the opportunities in our regional community are enhanced because of the open view about our willingness to be involved in the Asia-Pacific region in banking services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banking and financial services are not areas that people automatically assume are export oriented industries that we can utilise for the future economic growth and well being of Australia, but they certainly are. It is important that the arrangements that we develop, coming out of the decisions in the One Nation statement, relating to foreign banks be used to enhance that capacity of both our domestic banks and the foreign banks, representing important opportunities for us in the region in technology and in the area of the broader expertise in financial services, and we should be encouraging that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall refer just very briefly to two other matters. The fundamental principle behind the whole change that is occurring relates to creating more competition in the banking system, at the same time marrying that with the need to ensure that bank customers, depositors at banks, can feel secure about the institutions they are investing with. The way to achieve that is first of all to have a vigilant Reserve Bank; secondly, to provide more information to customers so they can make informed decisions about that; and, thirdly, to ensure that the types of products that are developed are well targeted to segments of the market place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the foreign bank issue there is a capacity for foreign banks to look further afield than has occurred with subsidiary banking in the mid- to late 1980s. There is a capacity and opportunity there for them, and they should be trying to utilise that. As far as the State banks are concerned, it is imperative that they be treated on an equal footing with the federally supervised banks. If all those things are done and the Council of Financial Supervisors does achieve the full role that our committee established it should be seeking to achieve over the next few years, we can have confidence in the restoration of our banking system, and I think in a model that will be emulated around the world rather than one that we have to say is second best to others around the world. I know my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) wants to speak, so I will conclude my remarks at that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members for giving me the time to say a few words on the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I particularly welcome the initiatives taken in the amendments before us. The record of both the Hawke and Keating governments in reforming the banking system over the last decade has been very important, and it certainly has been very important to international competition. I welcome the initiatives taken by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in this Bill in allowing foreign banks now to have branches in Australia for the wholesale banking sector. I think it is important that that is restricted to the wholesale banking system and that foreign banks continue to need to have subsidiaries in the retail sector. I think that is important for the protection of consumers' deposits in the retail area, and it was obviously very well debated during the Martin inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's record in government is outstanding as far as the banking industry is concerned. What concerns me is what could happen under some of the proposals that the Opposition is putting forward. I was interested to read in last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the Australian Bankers Association has expressed grave concerns about the impact that the Opposition's proposed GST would have on the banking system. Obviously the banks have been through a rough time over the last few years, and a lot of that was through their own fault in not being able to handle deregulation as well as they ought to, but they are coming out of that. Some things still need to be dealt with as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crazy part is that while they are coming out of that period we have the people in the Opposition running around trying to cause extra problems for them which would result in massive losses to the banking industry. We know what would happen if the banks started going backwards with their profits even more than they have over recent times: they would be passing that on to the consumer. Of course, what that would add up to is increasing charges and interest rates for Australian consumers. It would be a negative way to deal with things, with the GST particularly. The Opposition has offered to exempt the banking system, but that would backfire in the end. That is what it comes down to. It would not work at all and would clearly result in added costs to the consumer. It is something that we need to be very careful of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before us continue the response that we have been making as a government. I am sure the banking industry would welcome these initiatives here and that they would give it the confidence to move on to bigger and better things. Clearly, as the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) said before, we need to do much more in the international market when it comes to banking to be able to trade more effectively in services. I think the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has said before that we should be trying to enhance Australia as a financial centre for this part of the world, and that can only help the export of our services from time to time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the turn-out in the American election, it seems the American people have clearly attached great importance to this year's presidential election and during the campaign, I think Governor Clinton struck a cord in the American electorate with his call for a renewal of America's domestic strength. We can all identify with his campaign statement that America's first foreign policy and first domestic priority are the same, namely, reviving the American economy. I heartily concur in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This election has taken place in a time of quite profound change in the international system. The most important thing for Australia and America's other foreign partners is that the United States be confident of its strengths and values and sure of its place in the world. America has won the Cold War. It is now the world's economic and political leader and its confidence about itself, knowing about itself and asserting itself is important to everybody the world over, Australia included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that we can expect from the new Administration such confidence, given the clear mandate that Governor Clinton has received for an American revival. I am also confident that the Australian Government will be able to establish quickly an effective relationship with the new Administration. I might add that during the election campaign Government Ministers and our embassy in Washington made informal contact with some of Governor Clinton's key advisers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say as well that we are encouraged by the moderate and internationalist foreign policy stance that Governor Clinton articulated during the election campaign. He has also affirmed strong support for the multilateral trading system. As I said in the House yesterday, Australia attaches high priority to an early and successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, though that is not proceeding well, as we know, with further difficulties apparently being experienced today. But we hope that the authority of the President in the election result which has just been secured will give the American negotiating position strength at the negotiating table with the selfish policies of the Europeans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I think it is also the occasion to pay respect to President Bush for his achievements over the past four years, which have been considerable. I think, as he himself confirmed during his visit to Australia, President Bush has always been a good friend of this country. He proved that during all of the offices he held, including that of the presidency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the world will remember with great respect his successful management of US foreign policy during that challenging period as the Cold War ended, particularly in relation to Eastern Germany as the Wall came down and the difficulties which were presented to President Gorbachev during this period. The American Government response was critical to the ongoing change in terms of the break-up of the Warsaw Pact arrangements as it became clear that the Administration of the then East German republic was starting to introduce freedoms that resulted in the Wall coming down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That response&mdash;the careful, well-judged response of the American Administration of that time&mdash;was important to the successful conclusion of those events, that is, the freeing up of those states so long locked behind the Iron Curtain.

In so doing he elevated, for the first time really in the postwar years, the role of the United Nations, and he confirmed a role for the United Nations as an international peacekeeper and as the international authority in international disputes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is exercising this industry is the very unfair treatment it would receive at the hands of a coalition government in the levying of a goods and services tax. We see the headlines: `Opposition set to hear advice on altering the GST', `Builders press Hewson for GST change', `GST confronts big hurdle in the construction industry'. Because the coalition, under its policy, does not permit the taxation of a construction as an end point tax on the end product of, say, a builder of a hotel or some sort of traveller accommodation, or some building, then all of the GST costs that go into the building are not deductable or rebatable; that is, the taxes on the pipes, the concrete, and all of the other fittings of the building are not a rebate against the end point tax because the Opposition will not have an end point tax. The industry has to wear this huge cost. That is why it is making it quite clear how unfair this policy is. It wishes that there be an end point tax and that then, if the building is used for office purposes or tourism purposes, the costs to the people who use it will defray the costs of the end point tax, which themselves defray the costs under rebates of the input taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here is the Liberal Party telling us that it does not want to tax business inputs, and on one of the biggest industries in this country it is going to do just that: it is going to tax very heavily the business inputs; that is, the inputs in the development of office buildings, hotels and all other buildings. It will not give it the status of an end point tax and will, therefore, deny the builders of those buildings the benefits of eroding the impact of that tax and ameliorating it across the services which are then provided by those buildings, be they hotels or offices.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2555" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue raised by the honourable member for Burke is indeed an important one because employees do need to have an effective system of information about their entitlements and an efficient system for settling their grievances in relation to non-compliance by their employers. In the present system we have an award management staff of the Department of Industrial Relations who are available to service employees in this regard. There were more than 220,000 inquiries last year, 90 per cent of them by telephone. The award management staff have immediate access to all Federal awards so they are usually able to give immediate advice. They can usually deal with the telephone inquiries in less than five minutes. Those staff also have the power to conduct inspections of workplaces to ensure compliance with awards and deal with complaints. Last year there were 8,750 such inspections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They can also interview persons and require the production of employment records. Through these means they detected 17 1/2 thousand apparent breaches of Federal awards last year, the great majority of which were resolved without court action. Only 16 resulted in legal action. In the case of unfair dismissal, the Industrial Relations Commission can order reinstatement and possibly resolve underlying disputes at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that results in a very effective system for employees. It deals expeditiously with their inquiries; detects and satisfactorily resolves breaches of awards, mostly without resort to legal action; and provides an effective mechanism for dealing with the cases of unfair dismissal. It does all of that at no cost to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's question referred to the possibility of a system of individual contracts being introduced. Of course, if that were to happen there would be a very different system of arrangements. As proposed by the Opposition, it would mean that it would establish an office of the employee advocate which would act on behalf of the employees in such matters as claims for unpaid wages or other entitlements for unfair dismissal. So this office of the employee advocate would have a very narrow brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say, firstly, what it would not be able to do. It would not be able to protect the employees against exploitative conditions which were already in the contract. I will take the pertinent example of a journalist who is working under the Journalists' (Commercial Radio) Award and who is currently a grade 9 journalist on an award salary of $819 per week. Under the Opposition's policy, the base rate which would have to be put in an individual contract would not be $819 per week but the lowest base rate in that award, which is $438 per week&mdash;$380 less. If the contract had that lower rate there is absolutely nothing whatsoever that the office of the employee advocate could do about that.</PARA>

It is all in the contract. So, in terms of what he cannot do, it is pretty significant to realise that these important areas are outside his jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are a number of other detrimental aspects of this. It would be a very high cost, compared to current arrangements. Just look at providing advice. The office will not have a register of individual contracts, so you ring up and say, `Hey, I have got a problem about my contract`. The employees of the office cannot immediately look at the screen and see your award on the screen, because they do not know what is in your contract. You would have to supply them with a copy of the contract. So you have to send it to them, and the whole thing becomes a cumbersome, time consuming process. You can read the contract over the telephone, but the Office of the Employee Advocate may want to see the whole thing before a decision is made. It has to be done individually.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no award to look at which applies to employees. It is also a court-based system. There is no mention of inspection rights&mdash;rights to go and inspect the employment records or the workplace or anything like that. It is a court-based system. So the whole approach would be: take legal action. That means a much more cumbersome, lengthy, slow and expensive system than we have at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is on an individual basis, as I have mentioned. You cannot do group cases. They are individual contracts. They might all be different. You have got the possibility of considerable costs for the employee. Now, it says that it is free for the employee, that is, the services of the office are free, but what if the office takes the case, it loses and the costs are then awarded against the employee?  There is no protection in the policy, as announced, for the employee in those circumstances. Presumably, therefore, he has to pay those costs. Of course, that in itself is a massive deterrent<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to using the Office of the Employee Advocate to protect your rights, because you may be faced with very substantial costs for the employer. Also, ludicrously, the policy says that the employers may get legal and financial assistance from the Government in appropriate circumstances. So, picture this absurd situation: you go to the Office of the Employee Advocate and you say, `I have got this complaint about my case', and so it says, `Okay, I'll take it up' and takes up the case. Then the Government says, `We'll fund the employer too'. So the Government is funding the Office of the Employee Advocate on the one hand and funding the employer on the other in the same case. What a ludicrous circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the possibility under the present arrangements for the union to represent the worker in these cases is not there because the union cannot be a party to an individual contract. Therefore, it cannot take a case to a court on behalf of the employee. So, all these are massive detrimental elements of the Opposition proposal. But most importantly also, the treatment of industrial issues by the courts under common law is going to be very different from that of the industrial tribunals. The common law provides few protections against unreasonable dismissal, for instance, and that is why industrial tribunals have got into this area, because under common law there is no obligation for the employer to give reasons for dismissal, no rights to counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notice periods for most employers are very short, as the Prime Minister said yesterday&mdash;one week for an employee who is paid weekly, for instance, or a day if you are paid daily, and the courts generally will not order reinstatement. The general courts will not do that. Damages which are awarded by the general courts are usually inadequate to compensate for the loss suffered. So in all of those areas, you have a massively detrimental approach when current arrangements are compared to those proposed by the Opposition. Not only can your minimum conditions be reduced to well under current award conditions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those parallels&mdash;as many people, including my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), will remember&mdash;is that in the dying days of the Whitlam Government there was a loans affair; in the dying days of the Keating Government there is a loans affair. Although, as was observed yesterday, there is absent from this particular loans affair the presence of a Pakistani commodities dealer, there is nonetheless not absent from this particular loans affair the spectacle of a Treasurer and the spectacle of senior members of the Government under very heavy pressure not only from the Opposition but, more importantly, at the bar of the public opinion of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look back over the events of the last days of the Whitlam Government and that particular loans fiasco, I find one salient difference. That is a difference, I have to say, that rebounds not to the credit of the Keating Government but to the credit of the Whitlam Government. That is a very extraordinary thing to say&mdash;to actually make a comparison between any government and the Whitlam Government and say that the Whitlam Government came out ahead. But it happens to be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what it relates to? It relates to a very central issue: the question of prime ministerial strength and the question of accountability to the Parliament which is the cornerstone of the Westminster system. The fact is that despite his electoral travail, despite all of the political pressure to which he was subjected in the dying days of 1975, despite all the pressure he was under, Gough Whitlam had enough respect for this institution and for the Parliament of this country to sack Ministers who lied to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the courage, he had the tenacity, he had the decency and he had the respect for the parliamentary institution that he loved. He honoured it enough to have the courage to sack not only a just former Treasurer, in the case of Dr Cairns, the former member for Lalor, but also the late Minister for Minerals and Energy, the political godfather in many respects of the current Prime Minister and a man the current Prime Minister adored. It is a very strange irony that the current Prime Minister is refusing to apply the standard applied by one of his predecessors to a man that he adored in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is what is happening, because on two occasions in the dying days of the Whitlam Government Ministers were found on clear, unmistakable evidence to have misled the Parliament. The late Rex Connor was found to have misled the Parliament when he told that the communications of substance between himself and Tirath Khemlani had ceased, when in reality they had not. Dr Cairns was found to have misled the Parliament because he forgot that he had signed a letter authorising somebody to raise money on behalf of the Commonwealth Government&mdash;George Harris, a football mate of the former Treasurer of Australia. They were clear, unmistakable examples of a Minister committing the most serious parliamentary offence of all; that is, to mislead the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us forget about other things that are peripheral to this issue. There is one central unavoidable issue that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) must answer to, and nothing else as far as this motion is concerned.

That is what you did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Parliamentary forgery. That is the end of that particular excuse. I will make another comment which totally demolishes the argument put by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. One of the other boasts that have been made by the Prime Minister about documentation is that under his Government his Ministers do not uncritically accept what they are told by bureaucrats; they do not uncritically accept what they are given; they assert quite properly the right to apply an independent judgment to it, based on political considerations and knowledge of their own which might not be in the possession of the bureaucrats or those who provide the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, the Treasurer knew the situation. Before the Budget was presented, he had written back and told the Victorians that he was not prepared to agree to certain proposals that they put. When the Budget was brought down, he could hardly say, `Look, I did not really know. It was sight unseen. I had to pick up what they gave me and I had to plonk it in the documentation'. He could not do that either. He was absolutely stonkered on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer is gone on two scores. The first score relates to the Prime Minister's own declaration that, under him, Ministers exercise their own independent judgment. It is perfectly clear that the Treasurer was applying his own judgment, because he boasted about having rejected a Victorian proposal. He could hardly then be heard to say, `Well, I did not know the full story'. He knew enough of the full story to say no. So he cannot turn around and say, `I did not know the full story'. He is gone on that count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is also gone on the question, clearly and starkly, of why he altered the footnote. What possible explanation can you have if you were pleading the defence of the automaton&mdash;in other words, you had to put it in no matter what it was because it came from the Victorians and you had no discretion. The fact is that you had loads of discretion, and you exercised it in favour of your political convenience and your political advantage. That is your political crime in relation to this particular matter. By doing that, what you allowed yourself to do&mdash;what you did deliberately&mdash;was to mislead the people of Australia through the presentation of that Budget documentation. That is the central issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can talk as much as you like about the result of the American elections and previous Loan Council arrangements. What is at issue here is your accountability, your credibility, your truthfulness and your candour to the people of Australia through their elected representatives. That is what is at stake here. Nothing erodes the standing of a government more than when its Ministers get away with telling untruths to the Parliament. That is what is undermining your Government. That is what will eat away at what is left of the vitals of the Keating Government&mdash;the fact that its most senior and prominent member after the Prime Minister himself should be allowed to get away with misleading the Parliament. </PARA>

They ask why we did not know; why we did not do more about it. You are, as the Prime Minister said, just a pack of frauds. You will abrogate your own policy when it suits you in order to make a cheap and squalid point which is apparently aimed at me, but which in the end has been aimed at the good people of Victoria, because what you have been doing over the last couple of weeks is damaging the financial position of Victoria and making the borrowings of the State of Victoria more expensive. You have already imposed a $30m impost on the people of Victoria as a result of your irresponsible activity.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The propositions that the Treasurer has put forward bear no relationship in any instance to the truth. To begin with, his speech was about the dreadful things that had happened when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of Australia. The figures the Treasurer used about the Budget deficit, by the way, were totally untrue. The Keating-Hawke Government spent an additional $7 billion after the 1983 election to get a Budget deficit of $8.6 billion, and the claims that those opposite are making about what the honourable member for Bennelong knew or did not know at that time are totally and utterly false: they are utterly untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for that matter is the defence that the Treasurer put up after nine minutes of rhetoric from him about the dreadful days of the coalition Government. Before I go to that, let me make one other point. The Prime Minister thought it was very smart to comment during Question Time about the freedom that the States had to borrow as against the present arrangements under the Loan Council. But I do not think the Prime Minister should forget that when he came to power in 1983 with his mates&mdash;he will scurry away from hearing this because he will not want to hear it&mdash;every State in Australia and the Commonwealth had a AAA rating. Those ratings are not only an indictment of the way you have conducted business in this country but also confirmation of the slogan that Labor can never be trusted with money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could not be trusted in Western Australia&mdash;and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) knows that. You could not be trusted in South Australia&mdash;anybody who lives in South Australia, such as I do, knows that. We all know that even the Labor Government in Canberra would not trust the Labor Government in Victoria and, as a result, covered up for as long as it could the misfeasance of that Government. Federally, you have blown the country's AAA rating, you have blown out its foreign debt and you have blown the economy to pieces. You have put one million people out of work. That is proof, if ever proof were needed, that Labor cannot be trusted with money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at what the Treasurer has done here. It is a massive cover-up of the financial affairs of the previous Victorian Labor Government. In order to do that, the Treasurer has done something which is seldom done without the resignation of a Minister&mdash;and should never be done without the resignation of a Minister. He has deceived the Parliament. That act of deceit is contrary to hundreds of years of tradition under the Westminster system. So great is his contempt, the contempt of the Prime Minister and that of the Labor Party for Parliament that we see guillotine motions and  Ministers just walking out. They never stay for the debate; they wander around, not interested in what anybody has to say, and interested only in themselves. The Treasurer is off; he is on his way. He does not want to listen to the debate. He would rather not hear it because parliament does not matter. It never did matter to you people; it is an inconvenience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You agree! It is an inconvenience to the Prime Minister and it is an inconvenience to the Treasurer. He deceived the Parliament and the public. He has also done something which the markets have responded to very badly. You people&mdash;particularly the Treasurer, with the support of the Prime Minister&mdash;have deceived the financial markets of the international community. This act of deceit&mdash;the revelation that the books which are published by the Federal Government simply do not add up and the realisation by the financial markets that your figures are shonky and politically driven&mdash;has led to a serious run on the Australian dollar and an undermining of international confidence in the status of Australian finances. Frankly, I think that is a monstrous indictment of what the Treasurer has done, supported by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back and look at what actually happened here. We will examine the Treasurer's defence. He claims that the footnote on the document submitted by the Victorian Government was apparently of no particular concern&mdash;it did not really matter. So in Budget Paper No. 4 the Treasurer decided, very deliberately, not to publish that footnote and not to make any reference to that footnote or those borrowings. Apparently, that was all because he took the view that you could not really be sure that there was any breach of the Loan Council guidelines; and, what is more, the Victorian Government had not lodged an application for the extra money in any case, so until it lodged an application it did not really matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what he says and that is the basis of his defence. But what do the documents which he himself has released actually reveal? They reveal that, for all his rhetoric in this House, he was writing to the then Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Sheehan, drawing his attention to this problem and asking him to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A minute dated 24 July which came from the Victorian Treasury has a footnote about the borrowings which exceed the Loan Council guidelines. What do we discover? We discover that, on the one hand, the Treasurer's defence is that this was not any concern; this was not a breach of the Loan Council guidelines. But the letter which he signed and sent to the Victorian Treasurer only three days after that minute was sent made things perfectly clear. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I do not wish to canvass the issues in detail in this letter, I am sure that you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Victorian Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">appreciate that Victoria's actions, and your proposal are not consistent with either the spirit or the letter of the Loan Council agreements . . . for the Loan Council to simply agree to the proposal would put in serious question the credibility of those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>On 27 July the Treasurer wrote to the Treasurer of Victoria making it perfectly clear that the Victorian Government had breached the Loan Council guidelines. He received the information from the Victorian Government dated 24 July, three days earlier, but somehow this did not appear in Budget Paper No. 4. Somehow there was no need to reveal what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correspondence went on and on. The concern of the Federal Government, the Federal Government's case, was continually put and yet, of course, the key point of this is that the Treasurer never revealed in the Budget what in fact and what in reality was going on. In that respect, the Treasurer has misled the Parliament, deceived not just the Parliament, deceived not just the people of Australia, but deceived the financial markets of the international community, caused a run on the dollar and an undermining of international confidence in the way Australia manages its economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members to look at the letter that the Treasurer wrote on 7 August. The Budget, remember, was on 18 August, and remember that the $1.3 billion loan in excess of the Loan Council requirements was not in that Budget, but on 7 August the Treasurer wrote to the Treasurer of Victoria saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, the replacement on 1 May 1992 of the Treasury bills with medium term borrowings should not have been undertaken without Loan Council approval of the necessary special addition to Victoria's global limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is evidence signed by his own hand. That is evidence if ever evidence were needed. That is evidence that the Treasurer knew all along that Victoria had exceeded its Loan Council guidelines. It is evidence that he accepted that the additional figure in the footnote of the minute from the Victorian Treasury was part of the borrowings of the Victorian Government in the terms of the Loan Council guidelines, that they had been exceeded, and he was writing back saying something ought to be done about it. If that is true&mdash;which it is, according to his own correspondence&mdash;why ever is it that the Treasurer chose apparently not to reveal that information in the Budget? The fact is that by having failed to do that, he has acted with the greatest deceit, deliberately misled the Parliament and, I said before, he has deliberately misled not just the people of Australia but also international financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the former Treasurer of Victoria&mdash;fortunately for the people of Victoria he is now the former Treasurer of Victoria&mdash;this morning simply admitted this on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program as he bumbled his way through trying to explain away yet another case of Labor not being trusted to handle money.

<PARA>They are his words. It was reported to the Commonwealth Treasury on 17 June.

It is black and white proof for anybody other than them, but what more evidence is needed than the fact that the Treasurer is absolutely determined, as can been seen from Question Time today and his comments in the last 24 hours, to ensure that he does not appear before inquiries or release information, so that he does not have to discuss this matter any more?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it made a very clear reference to the $1.267 billion. Mr Deputy Speaker, where were the bloodhounds of the Liberal Party on that? Where were the Terry McCranns and the other great sleuths of Victorian financial accounts? Where were they? The thing is that they were asleep at the wheel. So here we have the report which the Treasurer urges be presented. It has actually been presented and is in the public marketplace. Then, at the first available opportunity, the incoming Government was apprised of these matters. We met Mr Kennett and his Treasurer, and these matters were dealt with the other evening. What more proper process is imaginable than the one undertaken by the Treasurer? The answer is none&mdash;absolutely, totally, thoroughly none.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>In other words, there was no authority for the Commonwealth Treasury to publish that number as an ongoing borrowing, and it did not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On his lawn when he did his interview, Mr Kennett said, `We want to get on with restoring the fortunes of Victoria'. You people have added to the cost of public debt interest enormously&mdash;by about $30m in Victoria. You are the people now calling into question the Victorian recovery. You are the wilful people trying to say that you are now fighting in Victorians' best interests; that is, you are wearing down their best interests in your own shabby interests. The Treasurer has no case to answer. The frivolity of the censure motion was demonstrated by the people who moved and seconded it: a former Treasurer who let the Loan Council processes criminally haemorrhage and a front bencher in the historical context of no account. That is who moved and seconded the proposition. We reject it absolutely. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>In January 1988 the Government established the Defence Housing Authority as the first step towards providing a better standard and an increased choice of housing for defence personnel and their families. At this time, the Defence Housing Authority took over responsibility for over 23,000 houses, and has a current investment program in excess of $270m per annum. The development, which is in line with the Government's commitment to increasing the Army's presence in the north, involves the construction of a residential subdivision involving the normal infrastructure services as required by the local authorities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project&mdash;Air Force aspects.</PARA>
<PARA>The defence logistics redevelopment project, which was announced for the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in June 1990, implements a rationalised and centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. Substantial savings will be achieved through the reduction in operating and manpower costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central part of this new warehousing strategy is a modern tri-service storage and distribution facility, the defence national storage and distribution centre, which will be established primarily at Moorebank but will also utilise some warehouse accommodation at Leichhardt, Regents Park, Bathurst and Dubbo in New South Wales. The DNSDC will accommodate most of Navy stocks, part of the Army national stocks and a small element of Air Force stocks. Concurrent with the development of the DNSDC each service will improve its regional warehousing infrastructure. The first construction element of this strategy is the Air Force component. This motion refers only to the Air Force component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air Force component will enable the relocation of the majority of Air Force stocks to bases and will involve the modernisation of storage and handling systems in warehousing accommodation at seven operational bases. This will allow the disposal of property at Tottenham, Toowoomba and Regents Park. Additionally, other activities such as one operational support unit and air training corps located at sites identified for disposal will be relocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental effects of the planned redevelopment works have been determined to be minimal. The works are mainly restricted to the existing buildings and facilities within the confines of existing bases. An environmental certificate of compliance has been issued. The limit of cost for the proposed works, at April 1992 prices, is $25m. It is planned that the work will go to tender in November 1992, with completion in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Public Works Committee agreed to the defence logistics redevelopment project&mdash;Air Force aspects, but raised the following specific issues: firstly, there should be regular surveys of the air quality in and around all defence warehouses which are clad with asbestos cement and which remain in use and if the surveys reveal airborne asbestos fibre concentrations exceed standards set by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, immediate remedial work should be carried out; secondly, warehouse 40 at Regents Park is a valuable asset and should be retained for use by defence as part of the defence national storage and distribution centre; thirdly, defence should continue discussions with Auburn Municipal Council and other planning authorities to ensure that the land which Defence proposes to sell will be used for purposes compatible with other adjacent land uses, including medium density housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended that Defence should provide details of the fire protection measures to the Commonwealth Fire Board for comment. Defence should ensure that optimal prices are obtained from land sales. Also, Defence should undertake further negotiations with local councils and planning authorities to ensure that when sold the uses of properties identified as surplus to defence requirements are compatible with local planning. Defence agrees with the recommendations and will take action as recommended. I thank the Committee for its work and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regarding the implementation of the program and a centralised strategy for warehousing and storage and distribution, on a previous occasion in this House I have given my support and that of the coalition for such rationalisation. As I mentioned previously, we need adequate and proper storage facilities for what has become very high-tech equipment both for our Air Force and  the other Services. However, the motion before us deals mainly with the Air Force. A central part of the new strategy is to provide such accommodation for the services and for their warehousing and component facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that I am concerned about relates to older buildings that have asbestos lining or cladding on them. I am unhappy with the recommendation on the monitoring of airborne pollutants for asbestos fibre. I would have preferred the Government to have set down a program to replace this cladding so that the real risk of asbestos fibre and the resultant asbestosis was removed not only from defence personnel but also from other people in the locality. I am unhappy about that aspect of the recommendations. I would prefer an ongoing program to be put in place to replace the asbestos cladding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding surplus property, I think it is entirely appropriate that councils should cooperate with the Services to bring about appropriate planning so that a reasonable price can be gleaned from land and that its use is compatible with the surrounding properties and residences. We should gain a sensible return for the Services, whether the land is used for medium, high density or detached housing. I hope that the relevant councils and planning authorities involved in those processes will cooperate to the fullest. Other than for making those comments, we support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Office construction at section 45, Belconnen, ACT, for Australian Estate Management to be leased by the Australian Taxation Office Canberra branch.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, is the construction of offices at Section 45, Belconnen, ACT, for the Australian Estate Management Group of the Department of Administrative Services. The building is to be leased to the Australian Taxation Office to accommodate its Canberra branch office which is currently accommodated in premises leased from the private sector in Civic. The proposed five-storey building will provide approximately 16,500 square metres of net lettable space&mdash;office, storage and document dispatch facilities&mdash;and 50 basement car parking spaces at an estimated completed cost not exceeding $40.91m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building site, bounded by Cameron Avenue and Chandler Streets in Belconnen, is Commonwealth owned. The western portion of the site is currently undeveloped and the eastern portion is a sealed car park. The building will accommodate 715 staff from the Canberra branch office of the Australian Taxation office. The project will also boost local employment and industry and is expected to generate at least 250 jobs on site as well as other ancillary services. The project is expected to take at least 17 months to complete. The proposal was referred to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in June 1992. The Committee tabled its report on 14 October 1992 and has recommended the building's construction at an estimated total cost of $40.9m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Committee made a number of recommendations, which I will comment on as follows. The first was that electricity for the proposed building should be derived from a gas cogeneration plant. The comment is that technical advice is that gas cogeneration would cost $2.85m more than the conventional electricity supply proposed and that total annual charges, which include components of capital, maintenance and running costs, would exceed the cost of electricity by $269,000 per annum&mdash;based on a 7 per cent discount rate and a 20-year life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Australian Taxation Office, as a prospective tenant of the new building, requires a reliable power supply comparable with that available from the new ACTEW grid. Backup equipment needed to achieve this has a high capital cost, would require additional plant space within the building and would be costly to operate and maintain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cogeneration is appropriate for industrial-type applications when there are steady power loads that match heating. It is not appropriate in office buildings which generally operate from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. with dissimilar power and heating loads. The Natural Gas Co. has advised the Public Works Committee that a gas cogeneration system is not financially viable for the Belconnen project. It is intended to proceed with plans to provide a conventional electricity supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point raised was that the proposed building be provided with a dimmed lighting system. Technical advice is that potential energy savings associated with the switched system that it is proposed to install are 35 per cent, compared to 30 per cent savings available through the use of reasonable cost dimming systems. The greater savings available through the use of a switched system arise from the ability to turn off selected lights automatically, whereas with reasonable cost dimming systems the lighting remains on at all times and can only be dimmed to a maximum of 50 per cent of full lighting output. In addition, the capital cost of the switched system is half that of a reasonable cost dimming system and will result in a saving of $99,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A dimming system that allows dimming down to zero per cent of full lighting output is now available; however, the capital cost of that system exceeds the cost of the proposed switching system by $313,000, and the pay-back period for the capital expenditure is 12 years, as opposed to two years for a switched system. On that basis, the use of a dimming system in the Belconnen building is not considered to be cost-effective. The Australian Taxation Office has expressed its concern about the refusal of manufacturers to warrant the performance of their fluorescent tubes with the use of automatic light dimming systems on the basis that it may result in higher lighting maintenance costs for the ATO. Consequently, it is intended to proceed with plans to provide a switched lighting system within the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point was that the contract for the removal of fill should not preclude its sale, but that the final destination of the fill be determined. If it is offered for sale, the cost of removal should be adjusted accordingly. Under the conditions of contract, the fill will be disposed of at an approved soil site agreed with the ACT Government. The fill will not be offered for sale by the contractor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point was that the extent of landscaping be reviewed to reduce the scope of shrub beds and associated irrigation. If the extent of shrub planting were reduced, cost savings could be achieved only if that shrub planting were replaced with grassed areas. This is not considered feasible for the following reasons: the requirements of the National Capital Planning Authority's development control plan for the area; the need to provide densely planted shrub beds to act as a security barrier to meet the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office, which has resulted in savings to the project by allowing perimeter fencing to be deleted from the scope of work; the gradient of some of the shrub beds is greater than that at which mowers can be safely operated; and the ongoing maintenance costs of shrub beds is significantly lower than that of grassed areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point was that the Committee be provided with quarterly progress reports on the progress of the work and the implementation of its recommendations. Australian Estate management agreed to provide the Committee with quarterly progress reports on the progress of the work. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the construction of an office block for the Australian Taxation Office at Belconnen, I would like to raise the following points which, in part, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) has already raised. I am pleased to see that the Minister has decided not to go ahead with the gas co-generation plant. The Public Works Committee noted in its report that the Taxation Office requires a reliable power supply comparable with that available from the ACT Electricity and Water grid. Why not use it if it is available, anyway? In modern buildings nowadays, if an emergency power plant is required, it is put into the building rather than a very expensive gas co-generation plant at a cost of $2.85m. I am pleased to see that in this case the Minister has ruled that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I too agree that dimmed lighting is not the right path to go down. I note that the manufacturers&mdash;quite rightly, in my view&mdash;have expressed their concerns about warranty for their product in regard to a dimmed lighting system. I share that view. I think the switched lighting system is the right way to go. It is a shame that more buildings do not put in a provision for switched lighting. It can bring about substantial lighting savings. It is not detrimental to fluorescent tubes or any other type of lighting and can bring about substantial savings in regard to energy requirements. On that basis, we support the recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA>1)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to Customs of information relating to the reporting, screening and clearance of cargo, and to permit limited on-line computer access to such information by other specified agencies;</PARA>
<PARA>2)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to improve waterfront security in accordance with recommendations of the Joint Review Committee which examined the 1989 report of the National Crime Authority;</PARA>
<PARA>3)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to extend eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme to vessels servicing oil and gas operations in the North West Shelf and Timor Gap exploration areas when those vessels travel to and from Australian ship repair yards for repairs or refits; and</PARA>
<PARA>4)amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to effect minor technical changes consequential on the introduction of the electronic lodgement reforms to the import entry regime in Act No. 34 of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1) Cargo Automation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments in clauses 6, 7 and 10 of the Bill are a response to the increasing role that electronic data interchange plays in international trade. The Australian  Customs Service is continuing to play an important role in the development of electronic initiatives to keep pace with EDI changes in international trade communications. The proposed cargo automation scheme introduced by this Bill is the third leg of the improvement and updating of Customs entry facilities for imports and exports and is modelled on the two earlier initiatives passed unanimously by this Parliament in Act No. 111 of 1990 for exported goods, and in Act No. 34 of 1992 for imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar to the two previous electronic schemes, the cargo automation system will operate on the basis of legislative amendments and contractual arrangements between Customs and users of the system. The proposed amendments in this Bill introduce an electronic computer option for the communication to Customs of information concerning cargo, to complement the current documentary manual cargo reporting facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cargo automation system will allow airlines, shipping companies and freight forwarders to give Customs reports of the cargo intended to be discharged at Australian ports in advance of the arrival of that cargo. Those details will enable the cargo to be effectively screened against various profiles; for example, those relating to prohibited imports. The profiles can be altered by Customs at any time to target specific types of goods or destinations and can be further refined on the basis of intelligence and data relating to import practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantage of an automated system is of course the speed with which it reacts to changing information so that effective risk assessment and risk management is maintained. With the amendments proposed in clause 27 of the Bill, port authorities will be provided with access to these cargo report details to facilitate the gathering of statistics and the calculation of wharfage charges, whilst the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will be provided with access to the cargo reports for the purposes of facilitating the detection of possible breaches of the Quarantine Act 1908. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new cargo automation system proposed in this Bill  introduces considerable benefits for all parties involved in the entry and clearance of cargo, not the least of which are the significant reductions in paperwork and the more speedy access to information, on the one hand; on the other, it will provide a major enhancement of Customs ability to speedily screen reports for correct details against various risk profiles and provide a more effective control over landed cargo and its subsequent movement under Customs control. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. Waterfront Security</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in clauses 5 and 23 of the Bill are intended to improve waterfront security by obliging persons in `Customs areas' to produce satisfactory identification upon request by a Customs officer and by strengthening the powers of Customs officers to stop and search vehicles in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are designed to overcome weaknesses in the present system which were highlighted by the National Crime Authority in its 1989 report on port security; in particular, problems faced by law enforcement agencies in their attempts to inhibit the flow of illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Review Committee established to examine the National Crime Authority recommendations had noted that the inability to control or identify wharf visitors and waterfront workers was hindering barrier enforcement. The present amendments squarely address that issue, and are discussed in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3. Diesel Fuel Rebate</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme contained in clause 21 of the Bill extend the eligibility criteria of the scheme, with effect from the Government's 18 August 1992 Budget decision, to allow certain ships to claim a rebate on diesel fuel used while travelling to and from Australian ports for repairs or refits. The ships concerned are those engaged in the servicing of the oil and gas operations off the Western Australian coast, including the North West Shelf and Timor Gap areas. Currently these servicing ships have an option to have repairs or refits undertaken either in Australian or Singaporean ship repair yards. Diesel fuel taken on by the ships in Singapore is at the international price, which does not include Australian excise. This has resulted in Australian ship repair yards being placed at a competitive disadvantage, especially those in Western Australia which are almost equidistant from the repair yards in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will effectively remove this disadvantage by reducing the cost of the Australian diesel fuel for those ships travelling to Australian ports for the necessary repairs or refits. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4. Other Amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the amendments outlined above, the Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to the electronic lodgment provisions of the Customs Act 1901, which were introduced last sittings by Act No. 34 of 1992.

<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 as part of the legislative package announced by the Government in December 1991 to introduce a new system for the imposition and collection of dumping and countervailing duties. This Bill provides the mechanism for the determination of interim and final duties, as well as introducing the two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected. The other Bill in the package, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill, introduces the new taxing regime for the imposition and collection of both interim and final dumping and countervailing duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments contained in this package represent the final change to Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing provisions which were announced by the Government on 5 December 1991 following a review of anti-dumping policy and administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last sittings, as part of Act No. 89 of 1992 this Parliament passed legislation which: reduced the total time allowed for the processing of anti-dumping and countervailing applications to the preliminary finding stage to a maximum of 125 days, or for more complex cases, a maximum of 145 days; extended, to five years, the period for which anti-dumping and countervailing measures remain in place; made provision for a review to be undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority following a request by an interested party as to whether measures should continue after the five-year expiry date; extended the life of the Anti-Dumping Authority to August 2001; and introduced a number of technical changes to facilitate the processing of applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Goods are said to be dumped if the export price of the product is less than the `normal value', that is, the comparable price for the like product in the domestic market of the exporting country. Anti-dumping action is taken only if it is established as a result of inquiries undertaken by Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority that goods have been dumped and that the dumping is causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government strongly believes that effective and timely anti-dumping and countervailing measures are necessary to protect Australian industry from material injury caused by  dumped or subsidised imports. At the same time, the Government is determined not to allow the anti-dumping and countervailing system to be used as a de facto means of industry protection. Australia's anti-dumping system is now one of the fastest and fairest in the world. There is scope, however, to improve its effectiveness by altering the manner in which duties are imposed and collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, the present legislation imposes a dumping duty which represents the difference between the export price and the normal value of the goods or, where the Minister so directs, a lesser amount sufficient to remove the injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present regime, duty is not payable where the dumping margin is purportedly eliminated by raising the actual export price to the level of the normal value determined at the inquiry. The Government considers that a more effective way to apply duties and strengthen the overall operation of the anti-dumping and countervailing system can be achieved with an approach similar to that used by the United States and the European Community. The proposals put forward in this package provide a mechanism whereby an interim duty will be imposed on each importation of goods subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Bill in this package, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill, provides that interim dumping duty will be based initially on the difference between the normal value and the export price as determined by the inquiries. Important additional features of that Bill are that the Minister will be able to determine the duty on an ad valorem or specific rate basis, and, where the export price falls below the export price ascertained by the inquiry, the difference between these prices will also be collected. That Bill also provides that the interim countervailing duty will be determined on the basis of the amount of the subsidy identified by the inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In either case, and consistent with both our current law and Australia's obligations as a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the new taxing regime will continue to require the Minister to consider the desirability of imposing a lesser rate of duty where this is sufficient to remove injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of an interim duty system in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill, this Bill proposes two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first such mechanism is a repayment or reimbursement facility whereby interim duty collected in excess of the actual dumping margin, in the case of dumping duties, or the actual subsidy, in the case of countervailing duties, can be repaid. To reduce the possibility of applications being lodged on a selective basis, for those consignments where it is known that a repayment is likely, this Bill requires that any application cover all consignments during a six-month period. Duty will not be repaid unless the total interim duty paid exceeds the total actual duty liability for the period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If no application has been received within six months of the end of the relevant importation period, the interim duty paid will be taken to be the final duty payable. The second mechanism to enable subsequent adjustments of the duty liability on goods the subject of a dumping or countervailing notice is introduced in the Bill via a review facility under which interested parties may seek a review of the interim duty to be paid on future shipments. The Bill proposes that a request for such a review may be made only 12 months after the interim duty has been imposed or 12 months after the last review of the rate. However, the Minister may, where it is considered appropriate, request at any other time that a review of the duty rate be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill details the type of information required in support of a request for a review together with provisions allowing interested parties to make submissions. It also places strict time limits on the review consistent with the other time limits applying throughout the dumping process. The Government is confident that the proposed new system strikes an equitable balance between the interests of importers and local industry, while conforming with Australia's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&mdash;GATT. </PARA>

<PARA>The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1992 amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to extend the period of guaranteed funding under the 1989 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, CSHA, by three years to 1995-96. The moneys appropriated include funding for a doubling of the provision of community housing through the introduction of a new community housing program within the CSHA. The Bill also provides for the bringing forward of out-year CSHA funding for employment creation in areas of housing need and high unemployment. As part of improved cash management arrangements being introduced under the CSHA in 1992-93, the Bill allows for funds that have been allocated to a State in respect of a grant year but not fully paid out in that year to be carried over between grant years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing reform initiatives announced by the Government in its 1992-93 Budget Statement `Housing&mdash;Choices for a Changing Nation' are necessitated by major changes in the structure of the population, the need to ensure that all Australians have access to secure, adequate, appropriate and affordable housing, the need for micro-economic reforms to increase the efficiency, flexibility and productivity of the housing industry, and the increasing urgency of environmental issues. The Budget measures build on the policy outcomes of the national housing strategy and include initiatives to keep home ownership affordable, to bridge the gap between renting and home ownership through shared home ownership, to increase the supply of low cost housing, to increase choice in management style, location and housing type, to provide more adequate and better targeted rent assistance, and to improve planning and development of our communities so as to safeguard the environment and ensure services are close to where people live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programs provided through the CSHA are a vital element of the integrated package put forward in the Budget, which maintains an important balance between supply and demand side measures. Public and community housing provides security of tenure, reduces the incidence of discrimination and ensures the availability of affordable housing stock to address the range of needs which may not be adequately addressed in the private market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since coming to office in 1983, the Labor Government has provided total Commonwealth funding of almost $7.1 billion under the CSHA to the end of 1991-92. An additional $2.4 billion was provided through nominated Loan Council arrangements which applied up to the end of 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stock of public housing has risen to around 370,000 at 30 June 1992, an increase of more than 51 per cent since this Government came to office. The number of home purchase assistance loans increased by 141 per cent, with the total value of loans now at more than $2,400m. This stands in contrast to the Opposition's policies which would see housing assistance provided in the form of means tested rental subsidies, public housing dismantled and the stock of houses which has been built up as a result of the community's investment over many years sold off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The narrowness of this approach is evident overseas where it can be seen that reliance on rental subsidies or allowances has resulted in a growth in homelessness in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is telling that the Opposition has adopted its very narrow approach at a time when there is increasing pressure for it to be abandoned overseas and for there to be a return to a balance between supply and demand side measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the allocation over the next four years of a total of $4186.37m under the CSHA, the Government has confirmed its commitment to continued expansion of the supply of low cost housing under the CSHA and to provision of greater diversity in public and community housing to meet the changing needs of the population. This total includes additional funding of $123m which will more than double the Government's existing commitment to the provision of community housing and will bring the total stock of public and community housing to over 400,000 units Australia-wide.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In negotiating the proposed funding package with the States and Territories, the Government has sought specific reforms to planning and cash management arrangements to ensure that State housing authorities are more accountable and that their services are more responsive to the changing needs of the communities they serve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forrest will have every opportunity. Perhaps he could be a bit more specific. This will involve improvements to consultation, planning and reporting arrangements under the CSHA, including introduction of three-year rolling plans and the development of outcome based performance measures, which will ensure greater accountability against agreed national objectives and related targets. These improvements will provide a basis for evaluation of the agreement in 1995 and for the development of national housing policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national objectives and priorities proposed by the Commonwealth are consistent with the existing principles in Recital (d) of the CSHA, but are an attempt to clarify the outcomes sought and to make more explicit the relationship between housing and broader urban planning and provision. Under new cash management arrangements being introduced in 1992-93, future Commonwealth grants will generally not be paid more than one month in advance of need as demonstrated by expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill enables any Commonwealth grants allocated to a State in a particular grant year, but not paid in that year for cash management reasons, to be carried over to the following year at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister. These improved cash management arrangements will eliminate a consistent pattern of underspend by the States and Territories, from which an estimated saving of $50m has been identified this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also obtained agreement from State and Territory housing Ministers to establish the community housing program as a new tied program under the agreement. The new community housing program is part of a supply initiative to enhance choice, appropriateness and flexibility of housing for people on low incomes. Its introduction will enhance the access of disadvantaged people on low incomes to affordable, responsive and accountable housing models which provide security of tenure and increased control and participation by tenants and the wider community. It will also facilitate the provision of housing which is better linked to services for those with special needs, including the aged and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community housing program will incorporate the current local government and community housing program&mdash;LGACHP&mdash;and will provide funding to local government and non-government agencies for the development and support of community housing in Australia. The aim would be to double the size of the community housing sector to 25,000 by the year 2000. A proportion of the funds allocated to the community housing program will be earmarked for national priorities in consultation with the States and funding will be paid through the States. The variations being made to the Commonwealth-State housing agreement will be formally tabled in the Parliament in the near future as soon as the necessary formal processes with the States and Territories are complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces flexibility to the existing arrangements for the allocation of untied Commonwealth-State housing agreement funds between States and Territories, to allow the amounts of $75m in 1992-93 and $25m in 1993-94 to be allocated to projects put forward by States and Territories to bring forward housing activity in areas of housing need and high unemployment, rather than on a per capita basis. These amounts are offset by reductions of $50 million in the level of untied grants to be provided in 1994-95 and 1995-96. Each State and Territory will, however, receive a per capita allocation of all untied funds over the period 1992-93 to 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill ensures that States and Territories are not disadvantaged under matching arrangements when Commonwealth untied grants are moved between years through the bring forward for employment creation or the operation of the new payment arrangements. I believe that the arrangements introduced in this Bill and the implementation of agreed reforms to the Commonwealth-State housing agreement will place the Commonwealth and the States in a stronger position to address housing needs of the many different types of households in the 1990s and beyond, will provide a better basis for the development of stronger national housing policies, will improve accountability, and above all will provide greater assurance that housing needs are being met more efficiently and with greater equity in a financially secure, long term climate of commitment and purpose.

<PARA>I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of an important piece of legislation that amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and will build upon the foundations of the best health care system Australia has ever seen. Medicare was established by this Government in 1984 and fulfils three major functions:</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;Medicare guarantees access to public hospital services provided by the States and Territories to all eligible Australians;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;Medicare guarantees access to services provided by medical practitioners and optometrists;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is the third leg of Medicare provides access to essential pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is concerned with the first of these health care functions; that is, continued provision of public hospital and other public health services to Australian residents. While a solid health care foundation has been laid, this Government is not content to stand still. We want to ensure that there is some national policy consistency and momentum on important issues such as improving public patient access to hospital services and improving the planning, efficiency and delivery of public hospital services. The national health strategy has set the direction for reform and identified the challenges we have to face. We know that the projected population change will mean increased demand for health services into the next century and that technological change often brings more expensive medical interventions. The national health strategy has also identified the impressive efficiency gains our public hospital system has achieved over the last 10 years and ways to improve those gains by developing better waiting list management, through better hospital budgeting by identifying and comparing treatment costs and through improved integration of community and hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is the vehicle for maintaining the impetus for hospital reform. It will establish the framework for the Commonwealth-State Medicare agreements and provide a special appropriation to guarantee funding certainty to State and Territory governments over the next five years. The money to be provided under the agreements will fund hospital reform initiatives across Australia in co-operation with the States and Territories. According to the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum, over the five years an additional $1.307 billion more is to be provided other than if the current agreement were continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, and through it, the Medicare agreements, offer scope to make public hospital services stronger, to tie in assured funding for five years and to provide incentive money to kick-start reform pilots in all aspects of hospital planning, management and service delivery. The Commonwealth has two objectives for the legislation. First, we intend to provide a funding guarantee to the States and Territories for the five-year life of the Medicare agreement from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1998. Secondly, our objective is to enshrine the Medicare principles and associated commitments in Commonwealth legislation. The principles and commitments have been developed in consultation with the States and the wording reflects State suggestions. While the principles focus on the provision of public hospital services to eligible persons, it is acknowledged that they operate in an environment where eligible people have the right to choose private health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the principles are centred on public hospital provision for public patients, since their purpose is to articulate the reasons for Commonwealth funding of State hospital services. The principles are:</PARA>
<PARA>Principle 1: Eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle 2: Access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle 3: To the maximum practicable extent, a State will ensure the provision of public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of their geographical location. </PARA>
<PARA>The principles articulate the concepts of choice, equity and access in public hospital service delivery. They give expression to the security that every Australian resident is looking for in the public hospital system and are the reason that our health system is so much better than those of other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also outlines the broad conditions for funding that will apply in the Medicare agreements. The most fundamental of these is that receipt of funds is conditional upon signature of the Medicare agreements. These conditions include taking steps towards passage of State and Territory legislation that is complementary to the Commonwealth Bill and which enshrine the Medicare principles and commitments. Under the Medicare agreement both levels of government will undertake to implement the principles and commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does not expect the States to implement the principles and commitments alone, but to recognise that both levels of government have an interest and duty to maintain our public hospital services and to ensure that public patients get the most comprehensive and fairest health service possible. Part of this provision involves the delivery of information to eligible public patients. This is reflected in commitment one which requires the joint Commonwealth and State development of a public patients' hospital charter. The Commonwealth's vision for such a charter is that it will be a `plain English' guide to what Australian residents can reasonably expect as a public hospital patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does recognise that immediate passage of complementary State and Territory legislation may not be possible in some States, despite the best endeavours of governments. It is for this reason that the Bill allows some scope for definition in the agreements of what constitutes reasonable efforts towards adoption of the principles and commitments in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commitment two encompasses efficiency and quality in public hospital service delivery. This is one of the priorities of the Bill and Medicare agreements and will be supported by the incentive package reforms. These reforms include continuing the development and implementation of casemix systems in hospital service delivery, ensuring elective surgery for public patients is organised efficiently and fairly, and investigating with the States and Territories better ways of developing capital strategic plans for hospitals and providing hospital services that meet local area needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not achieve this level of reform without the States and Territories. Improvement in our public hospital services involves Commonwealth, State and Territory commitment of effort and money. The Commonwealth is providing a funding increase of approximately 7 per cent over the base hospital funding grants to make our public hospital services more efficient and effective. This legislation will demonstrate to the Australian public that both levels of government are committed to excellence in health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we recognise that circumstances differ in each State, and in the bilateral negotiations taking place, the outcome of which will be reflected in the agreements, we are responding positively to the particular circumstances of each State, within the overall framework of the principles and commitments. The Bill provides for this flexibility. It allows for flexibility and consultation on the agreement and it allows for consultation with the States and Territories on the timetable for implementing components of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>It is generally accepted that health care consumers can suffer adverse outcomes from health services.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Quality Assurance Activities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance embraces a wide range of activities. These include: hospital based peer review processes, such as clinical audits into surgical mortality rates; academic studies into the incidence or causes of adverse patient outcomes; peer committees to counsel or assist other practitioners who are having difficulties which may lead to adverse patient outcomes; and the performance evaluation of individual health care professionals for the purpose of determining the clinical privileges of that professional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread support amongst medical practitioners and consumers for open, positive and voluntary participation in such activities to prevent adverse patient outcomes and raise the quality of health care delivery. In terms of outcome, quality assurance activities are the embodiment of the phrase `prevention is better than cure'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past these activities have been inhibited by the fear of health professionals that information generated by quality assurance activities may be used by patients in personal injury litigation. In addition, there is a fear held by health care professionals who participate in any peer review activities which can affect another practitioner's practising rights, that that colleague may sue the participants if they are dissatisfied with the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of States and Territories have introduced legislation to address these concerns and this Bill is based on current legislation in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. However, the existing States and Territory legislation will not prevent actions under Commonwealth legislation or in courts exercising Federal jurisdiction to subpoena material created solely for the purpose of quality assurance activities. This Bill also provides protection for national projects and studies which are undertaken by the medical colleges or other professional associations across all or a number of States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will promote the undertaking of a range of quality assurance activities by providing statutory protection in the form of confidentiality of quality assurance information and immunity to quality assurance activities and committees which are declared by the Minister. The Government recognises that conferring confidentiality and immunity on the activities of a particular group of professionals has the capacity to affect individual rights and interests. For this reason, a number of checks and balances have been built into the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, activities will only be declared under the Bill on the application of those carrying out the activity and after the Minister has satisfied himself or herself that among other things, it is in the public interest to provide the protection. The Minister's declaration will be by way of a disallowable instrument and so will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In circumstances where information gained by a quality assurance activity may relate to a serious criminal offence, the Minister may authorise the disclosure of the information for law enforcement, royal commissions or other prescribed purposes. Further, before members of committees established for the purposes of evaluating the services provided by other health care professionals will be entitled to the protection of immunity from suit, their participation will have to have been in good faith. The Bill will not provide immunity in relation to proceedings for the breach of the laws of procedural fairness, thus providing balancing protection for affected health care professionals. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed sale of Qantas Airways Ltd is an important part of the Government's extensive program of reform of the Australian aviation industry. From 1988 on, the boards of directors for both Qantas and Australian Airlines had repeatedly raised with the Government the question of their being given greater access to equity capital. The airlines were weighed down by grossly un-commercial debt to equity ratios at a time of rapid business expansion. The Government therefore had to face up directly to the question of whether or not to invest a large amount of funds in the airlines and, if so, to then forgo expenditure in other higher priority areas as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with this choice, the Government decided in September 1990 to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. In doing so, the Government recognised that, in the particular circumstances prevailing in the aviation industry, many of the benefits that are thought to come from public ownership in the sector could still be achieved under private ownership. Shortly after that decision was taken, the Government introduced the successful de-regulation of domestic aviation, which has seen unprecedented numbers of people flying at markedly reduced fares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a detailed `scoping study' of the various sales options open to it, the Government announced in April 1991 that the sale of each of Qantas and Australian Airlines would proceed on the basis of an initial `trade sale' process&mdash;thereby offering large prospective purchasers the chance to acquire a significant equity interest in either or both airlines at a premium&mdash;followed by a public float to sell any remaining equity. As a result of the respective sales processes, both airlines would be appropriately recapitalised and suitable employee share ownership schemes would also be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, in the One Nation statement made to Parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February 1992, further far-reaching aviation reforms were announced. The statement established the framework and timetable for removing the barriers between Australia's domestic and international aviation sectors, permitting multiple designation of Australia's international air services, and for developing a single aviation market with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale process involved submission of expressions of interest from prospective trade buyers, with indicative non-binding bids. From this it became clear that a number of prospective purchasers, as well as Qantas and Australian Airlines themselves, believed that substantial synergistic benefits and operational efficiency gains could be achieved if Qantas and Australian Airlines were to be combined into a single entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, on 2 June 1992 the Government announced that Qantas would be permitted to acquire Australian Airlines for $400m, thus providing the best mechanism for quickly achieving the synergistic benefits offered by a link-up between the two airlines, to the overall financial advantage of taxpayers generally. The Government also announced then that 100 per cent of the expanded Qantas group would be sold&mdash;rather than 49 per cent, as originally decided&mdash;with the community's interests being protected by a number of national interest safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The artificial distinction between domestic and international aviation has largely been broken down. At the same time, Qantas has acquired a local aviation network and secured a strong domestic base for its international operations in future through the acquisition of Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill now before the House contains the legislative changes that need to be made to enable the sale of Qantas to be finalised, taking into account all possible outcomes, including the fact that varying levels of ownership could be sold during the current `trade sale' process prior to the ensuing public float next year. The Bill also reflects key sale requirements relating to the national interest safeguards required with the sale of 100 per cent of Qantas, the recapitalisation of Qantas, the reconstruction of its debts in preparation for the impending change of ownership and the terms and conditions of employment for its staff. The vast bulk of the Bill is concerned with the removal of both airlines from the ambit of a variety of Commonwealth legislation so that, post sale, the expanded Qantas group will be treated the same as other private sector enterprises generally. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Interest Safeguards</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamentals of the national interest safeguards, referred to earlier, need to be enshrined in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>These safeguards are important to maintain the basic Australian character of Qantas, as well as to ensure that Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat. Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the Bill requires that Qantas's Articles of Association must contain provisions which will ensure that: Qantas's main operational base and headquarters remain in Australia; that the name of Qantas is preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services; that the company be incorporated in Australia; that at least two-thirds of the board of Qantas be Australian citizens; that the chairman of the board also be an Australian citizen; and, in particular, that total foreign ownership is not to exceed 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also require Qantas's articles to specify that no single foreign interest can exceed 25 per cent of the equity of Qantas. Qantas's articles will be required to provide directors with wide powers to act, including to deny registration or to force the disposal of shares held by foreigners, to ensure the 35 per cent foreign ownership limit and the 25 per cent limit on single foreign interests are not breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires that a restriction apply to any `block' shareholdings of foreigners representing more than 15 per cent of the voting shares in Qantas. All such foreign block share holdings, either individually or in aggregate, will not be able to vote on more than one-third of board members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directors of Qantas have a clear commercial incentive, as well as a moral and legal duty, to adhere to the specific new articles that the Bill requires. The Bill ensures that any attempt by shareholders to change the articles required by the Bill can not have any effect. In addition, specific provision is made in the Bill for the Minister for Transport and Communications to monitor the level of foreign ownership and control of Qantas in future and to take appropriate legal action in the event that the stipulated national interest safeguards are breached or seem likely to be breached. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Debt and Capital Reconstruction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the rationale for the sale of Qantas, the Bill provides the basis for the recapitalisation of Qantas. It is important to note that the Government intends to remove the substantial amount of Commonwealth-guaranteed debt in Qantas's existing debt portfolio, prior to sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the important question of principle involved,  the Commonwealth cannot countenance the possibility of its still being potentially liable for over $1 billion of Qantas's debt once control of the airline shifts to the private sector. This would be tantamount to the Commonwealth retaining a major stake in the company despite its 100 per cent sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a small amount of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt is able to be paid out up-front because it is in the form of widely held bearer bonds. Thus, the Bill allows the Commonwealth to assume the obligations and to make all the necessary payments, including the payment of interest and the repayment of principal, associated with this debt as they become due and payable. It also appropriates the funds required to meet these obligations. At current exchange rates, the face value of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt is about $1.1 billion and the associated interest payments total about $500m. Qantas will pay the Commonwealth to assume this debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable Qantas to do this, the Bill provides sufficient appropriation for Qantas to receive a subscription to share capital from the Commonwealth of an amount at least equal to the face value of the debt to be taken over by the Government, at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the debt assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Bill provides for a total appropriation of up to $1.4 billion to cover possible subscriptions to Qantas's share capital in order to allow for adverse movements in exchange rates between now and the time of assumption of the Commonwealth-guaranteed debt. It also provides scope for a separate share subscription to be made to Qantas for recapitalisation purposes should that be needed. This could conceivably involve discharging other Qantas debt as part of the debt restructuring required prior to sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Short term Commonwealth guarantees are also allowed for in the Bill to cover possible contingencies, particularly in relation to the refinancing of the short term commercial paper program of Australian Airlines prior to a 100 per cent sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a debt assumption of up to $300m should it be considered necessary or desirable to neutralise any effect of the debt restructuring on the profit and loss account. This will cover the worst case scenario. At current exchange rates, the net loss to Qantas's profit and loss account would be less than $100m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the takeover of some of Qantas's debts by the Commonwealth&mdash;including any payment made to neutralise an undue effect on Qantas's profit and loss account&mdash;would result in an excessive recapitalisation of Qantas, a special one-off dividend payment or a refund of capital to the Commonwealth could be sought from Qantas before the sale is finalised. Alternatively, if the net recapitalisation effect of the debt assumption by the Commonwealth is not sufficient, new Qantas shares could be sold, along with the Commonwealth's existing shares, or the general share subscription provisions in the Bill could be used to meet this need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to emphasise that any recapitalisation of Qantas that is effected by the Government during the sale process will be fully recouped in increased proceeds from the sale of the Commonwealth's equity in Qantas. There will, therefore, be no net impact on the Budget from these debt and recapitalisation provisions over time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the Bill provides for a number of savings provisions in respect of a variety of Acts, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act and the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, other rights not conferred by Commonwealth legislation will not be affected by the sale. Regulations will be separately introduced under the Superannuation Act 1976 to ensure that employees of Australian Airlines who are currently members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme do not lose the superannuation benefits that they will have accrued under this scheme prior to the sale of 50 per cent of Qantas. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Legislative Provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Government's commitment that Qantas should operate within a fully commercial environment as soon as possible, the airline is to be freed from all legislative constraints which apply generally to Commonwealth business enterprises, once a sufficient amount of equity in Qantas has been sold. Provisions for this are largely contained in the schedule to the Bill. Employee-related legislation aside, the proclamation to effect the cessation of such legislation will be made when sufficient equity in Qantas has been sold. As noted previously, the application of special employee-related legislation to Qantas will not be removed until at least 50 per cent of its equity has been sold. These provisions necessarily lead to special commencement arrangements. Details are contained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should not be concerned on public accountability grounds at the prospect of the Commonwealth being in the position after the trade sale of retaining a majority shareholding in Qantas, pending the ensuing public float, but having removed most of the Government administrative controls and legislative provisions currently applying to Qantas as a Commonwealth Government business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For so long as the Government retains a majority shareholding in Qantas, it will require specific articles to be included in Qantas's articles of association in order to discharge its responsibility to the Australian public for its continuing, but transitory, majority ownership of Qantas. The Government would in any event have the reserve power, which would only be exercised in very limited circumstances in the transitional period prior to full sale, of using an ordinary resolution at a general meeting to protect the community's investment in Qantas in the lead-up to full sale. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas and, in particular, the anticipated public float could leave purchasers of equity in Qantas liable for certain State and Territory taxes. In the absence of other action, this would depress the expected returns to all taxpayers throughout Australia from the sale of Qantas and benefit taxpayers in a particular State only. It would also complicate the sale process. To avoid these difficulties, the sale or issue of shares in Qantas and related transactions, as well as all transactions entered into in relation to the necessary debt and capital reconstruction of Qantas prior to sale, are to be exempted from most State and Territory taxes and duties. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill covers a wide range of topics. The purposes of the amendments include compliance with the superannuation guarantee requirements, ongoing compliance with the occupational superannuation standards, streamlining of the administration of some of the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes and clarification of areas of the legislation. A major part of the Bill involves amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to comply with the superannuation guarantee requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament approved legislation for the superannuation guarantee earlier this year. To comply with the superannuation guarantee requirements, this Bill includes amendments to the 1976 Act scheme to ensure that: the minimum amount of employer benefit required under the superannuation guarantee is vested in each employee each year from 1 July 1992, and provide an additional benefit in two situations to meet that requirement; and an amount representing that minimum amount to be preserved until genuine retirement from the work force on or after age 55 or earlier death or invalidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the benefits under the 1976 Act scheme would more than meet the minimum employer benefit required by the superannuation guarantee legislation. Therefore, it is likely that the additional top-up benefit need be paid only in two circumstances, namely, death in service without dependants and resignation without preservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes specific amendments to the 1976 Act scheme to continue the ongoing process of compliance with the occupational superannuation standards. Many of the occupational superannuation standards are provided for in regulations under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. I draw honourable members' attention to the fact that the Bill provides that regulations may be made under the 1976 Act to satisfy conditions or requirements of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and regulations under that Act. This provision is essential to enable changes to be made to the 1976 Act scheme to keep up with changes in the standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments also make provision for recognition of multiple memberships of the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes where a person holds more than one job. The era when a single full time job was the recognised pattern of employment has passed. Persons can hold a full time job plus a part time or casual job or more than one part time or casual job. The provisions in the superannuation schemes do not necessarily cater for such multiple jobs in a satisfactory way. For example, a permanent part time employee who is a member of the 1976 Act scheme cannot receive benefits in respect of a casual job that he or she might hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990 can cater for some cases of multiple employment. However, the variety of employment patterns that is emerging means that the rules need to be examined to see whether they are equitable in all circumstances. The proposed amendments to the 1990 Act in this area will take effect from a future date to enable appropriate revision of the rules to be made where necessary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Bill will provide for multiple memberships within the one scheme or membership of more than one scheme in appropriate circumstances. Given the variety of multiple employment patterns that now exist, flexibility to cater for situations where a person's benefits should, in fairness, be treated as one membership also is to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the remaining amendments in the Bill are technical in nature. Some amendments are desirable to provide for consistency of administration. For example, amendments to the 1990 Act will provide that benefits under that Act will be paid from Consolidated Revenue directly to the member as happens with the 1976 Act scheme and the Defence Force schemes, rather than have the payments going from Consolidated Revenue to the fund and then to the member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments clarify the legislation and remove unintended effects. For example, amendments to the 1976 Act scheme in the Bill clarify the intention that persons leaving the 1976 Act scheme because of the sale of a Commonwealth asset or the transfer of a Commonwealth function and who either continue to be employed or reject an offer of equivalent employment, do not have access to retrenchment benefits. Some of the amendments operate retrospectively. These would either benefit members, correct unintended effects of the current legislation, or are technical amendments required by changes to other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the financial impact of the Bill. Most of the proposed changes do not have any financial impact because they are technical amendments or clarifications of existing provisions. Where provisions could have a potential financial impact, the impact is likely to be small. For example, the two circumstances mentioned earlier where an additional benefit is needed under the superannuation guarantee are uncommon. Moreover, the amount of any additional benefit would be small because members would already be entitled to the 3 per cent productivity benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the potential financial impact of the changes in the Bill would be contingent on the happening of future events which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Therefore, the financial impact cannot be quantified. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I am very pleased to move the introduction of these amendments to the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. The amendments before us today arise out of an extensive review of the Act which involved consultation with all parties affected by the legislation, including employers, unions, higher educational institutions and women's organisations. None of the proposed changes alter in any fundamental way the original intention of the Act. Contrary to the fears and concerns expressed by some people some six years ago, the Act enjoys widespread support among employer organisations, unions and the wider community. Many employers have indicated that the Affirmative Action Act has been very useful in focusing their attention on the needs of their women employees, and that there have been positive spin-offs in efficiency generated by implementing equal opportunity policies. The importance of affirmative action programs was highlighted in the recent Lavarch Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half Way to Equal</EMPHASIS>. The Committee was categorical in its support for affirmative action programs which it stated are `integral to greater access to career opportunities for all women'. This Government wholeheartedly endorses these views and, indeed, the Bill before the House forms an important part of our response to the recommendations arising from the Lavarch report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the Act and the findings of the Lavarch inquiry came to similar conclusions about the effectiveness of affirmative action programs. Over the last six years, the Act has played a pivotal role in winning support for the principle of equal opportunity. Independent research commissioned as part of the review found overwhelming endorsement for the equal participation of women in paid employment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while there are a growing number of companies with exceptional affirmative action programs, many employers have yet to move beyond the rhetoric to institute comprehensive changes in their own management and work practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for ongoing reform is clear. While women make up 42 per cent of the paid work force, they are often disadvantaged at work. Despite the increasing participation rate, many women are confined to a narrow range of jobs at the bottom end of the hierarchy with far less access to training, career paths and reasonable pay. Many women work part time to balance the double load of domestic responsibilities and paid employment. These women are often excluded from the benefits accorded to full time work. The predominance of women in low paid part time work is a key explanation for continuing pay inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is important for government to provide the framework for change through legislation, real structural and attitudinal change has to occur at the level of the workplace. That is why the Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that, over the next few years, there will be a much greater emphasis on the quality of affirmative action programs. We will be working closely with employers, unions and other interested parties to help make equal opportunity in employment a reality for all women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will do this, not only because the Government has a fundamental commitment to ensuring that women get a fair deal at work, but also because this approach is vital to the health of the Australian economy. More and more businesses are recognising that international competitiveness and increased productivity are dependent on valuing and utilising the talents of the whole work force. Outmoded personnel policies and attitudes which hold women back are against the interests of any organisation which wants to do well in today's competitive environment. Affirmative action provides the springboard for the kind of initiatives which need to occur so that women can contribute fully to their workplace&mdash;from employer supported child-care to career break schemes to more flexible, family friendly hours of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take a moment to contrast this Government's approach with that of the Opposition. The Opposition has said it will abolish the Affirmative Action Agency but still keep the legislation. How can the Opposition claim to be in favour of equal opportunity and simultaneously destroy the organisation which has been set up to advise, assist and monitor employer compliance with the Affirmative Action Act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy is totally out of touch with the community. Employers have indicated their support for the agency and want it to provide them with more assistance and advice. The Opposition's policy to abolish the agency is only the tip of the iceberg. The Opposition's industrial relations policy will be particularly harmful to women because they are less likely to be members of unions and are often in low skilled jobs with little bargaining power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy would remove many women from their awards and then force them on to individual employment contracts where they could face big cuts in their pay and conditions. Women could be forced to work long hours in total conflict with their family responsibilities. In complete contrast, the Government's approach to industrial relations and the amendments to the Affirmative Action Act, recognises the importance of protecting award wages and conditions and improving the position of women workers. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Coverage of voluntary bodies, unions and group training schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to this legislation are an important part of this approach and set a new direction for the Affirmative Action Agency. The Government has decided to retain the current threshold of 100 employees for an employer to be covered by the Act. Reducing the threshold at this stage of the legislation's life would divert resources from improving the quality of affirmative action reports. Instead, the agency will provide greater assistance and advice to smaller employers not covered by the Act on how to implement affirmative action programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Bill will remove some existing anomalies in coverage by extending the coverage of the legislation to voluntary bodies, union officials and group training schemes. The extension of the Act to voluntary bodies, mainly large private schools and charities, will be particularly important as it means that an estimated 60,000 additional employees will benefit from the Act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Affirmative action agency as a statutory body</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill changes the status of the agency to that of a statutory authority. This proposal will give the agency greater protection against the Opposition's intention to abolish the agency. It also gives legal weight to the current relationship of the agency to government. The agency is already located separately from the Department of Industrial Relations, and is directly accountable to the Minister. This has allowed the agency to develop its own identity and high profile with its client groups. By clarifying its legal status, the Government is cementing the independence and authority of the agency, while still maintaining accountability to the Minister and this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Discretion to vary reporting requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A discretion to vary reporting requirements will be introduced in the Bill. This amendment will assist in improving the quality of affirmative action programs. It provides the director of the agency with the discretion to alter reporting requirements, or waive them for exceptional performers. Such an approach requires the development of performance standards and benchmarks which can then provide the criteria for identifying those employers which have achieved best practice and exceeded expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than impose these standards, a tripartite committee will be established to develop practical and reasonable standards which are adaptable to the diverse range of organisations covered by the Act. An immediate priority will be to focus on those steps in affirmative action programs which have had low levels of compliance, especially consultation with unions and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of standards will improve the accountability of companies for their affirmative action programs. It will also allow the agency to use the experience and expertise of high achieving companies for the benefit of other organisations. This will be complemented by the establishment of a program allowing employers to apply for grants to assist in developing best practice affirmative action programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these amendments are part of this Government's wider program of positive reforms which recognise that women are a permanent and vital part of the Australian work force, and that they must be assured of a fair and satisfying working life. The Government has a proud record of achievement in improving the position of women in the work force. We have been responsible for providing women with legal redress under the Sex Discrimination Act and have ratified International Labour Organisation convention 156 on workers with family responsibilities which makes it an aim of national policy to balance work and family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Affirmative Action Act is an essential part of this strategy, because it recognises that discrimination against women is not merely an individual matter which can be addressed on a case by case basis, but is part of our cultural, economic and industrial heritage. The legislation is concerned with encouraging employers to remove the limitations imposed on women in a systematic and detailed way. This Bill will make the Act more effective and allow the agency to build on the achievements it has already made, particularly in the area of the quality of companies' affirmative action programs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to implement more recommendations of the 1991 Brown review of the Comcare program. The review made a number of recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to implement the recommendations of the Brown review in stages. Honourable members will recall that the first step in implementing those recommendations was the restructuring of the Commission as a regulatory body distinct from its service delivery arm, Comcare. The Commission is now responsible for regulatory functions under the Act, such as the setting of premiums, while Comcare is responsible for the commercial, administrative and service functions under the Act, and provides administrative support to the Commission. Those changes were made by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further changes to implement the recommendations of the Brown review were made by the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992. These amendments altered the status of AOTC Ltd and Australia Post from administering authorities to licensed authorities under the Act and improved Comcare's financial arrangements. The effects of these changes were to make AOTC Ltd and Australia Post more accountable to the Commission for their operations under the Act, and to establish a system of regulation by the Commission to ensure greater consistency of practice between Comcare and the licensed authorities. AOTC Ltd and Australia Post were deemed to have been granted a class 3 licence on the commencement of the new arrangements for a period of 12 months. To date, they are the only licence holders under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Act which would be made by this Bill would build on the changes that have already been made to the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. The main purpose of the Bill before the House is to allow the Act to extend to certain corporations outside the Commonwealth public sector. The Government has adopted this course so that former Commonwealth authorities, such as the combined Qantas-Australian Airlines, which have been or are about to be privatised, can choose to remain covered by Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that these former Commonwealth authorities are not advantaged by their access to the scheme, the Bill will also allow the Act to apply to those private sector corporations which are in competition with a privatised Commonwealth authority. For very similar reasons, the Government has decided to extend the option of cover under the Act to private sector corporations which are in competition with any Commonwealth authority, regardless of whether the authority has been, or is to be, privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reflect the widened ambit of the Act, its title will be changed to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The amendments will result in corporations which may be granted cover under the Act having access to a nationwide workers compensation scheme. The Government believes that this will further the progress of micro-economic reform and lead to greater efficiencies by reducing the administrative burdens on corporations which currently have to operate in several workers compensation jurisdictions around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cover under the Commonwealth scheme will be optional for those corporations which are eligible. No privatised Commonwealth authority or private sector corporation will be required to take up cover under the Act. Each corporation will make a decision based on its own commercial judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will effectively implement the second part of recommendation 13 of the Brown review that Comcare should be able to cover fully privatised former Commonwealth authorities. Recommendation 13 also proposed that Comcare should be allowed to manage claims in jurisdictions other than the Commonwealth. However, the Government has decided to allow the Act to extend only to private sector corporations which are in competition with a Commonwealth authority or a former Commonwealth authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of the Act has been discussed with State and Territory governments, which have been assured that it will not exclude privatised Commonwealth statutory corporations and other private sector corporations from their responsibilities under State and Territory occupational health and safety legislation. Safeguards will be built into the licensing arrangements to ensure these responsibilities are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is also concerned to ensure that the extension of the Act does not adversely affect the operations of State and Territory workers compensation arrangements. This has been the subject of discussion with the States and Territories, and is to receive further consideration through a formal joint Commonwealth and State-Territory review. It is envisaged that this review will be completed by the end of April 1993. The Act will be implemented only in respect of privatised and continuing Commonwealth authorities until the review is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The licensing arrangements contained in this Bill are similar in many respects to those contained in the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992 that applied to Commonwealth authorities generally. The Bill provides for two classes of licence&mdash;a class A licence and a class B licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A class A licence will allow corporations to self-insure. The management of claims by employees of class A licensed corporations will be carried out by a subsidiary of Comcare. A class B licence will allow the corporation to self-insure and to make appropriate arrangements for the management of claims by its employees. Those arrangements may be, for example, claims management by the corporation itself, by a Comcare subsidiary, or by a third party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Bill, the Minister for Industrial Relations must be satisfied that a private sector corporation is in competition with a Commonwealth authority or former Commonwealth authority before it can be considered for a licence. The actual decision whether a corporation should be granted a licence, and the nature of any conditions that may be attached to the licence, will be for the Commission to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both classes of licence will require a corporation to self-insure. It will be a condition of each licence, therefore, that the corporation will obtain bank or other guarantees to ensure that the corporation's liabilities will be met. In addition, the Commission will need to be satisfied before granting a licence that satisfactory arrangements have been made to ensure that employees of the corporation will continue to receive their entitlements if the corporation is wound up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before granting a class B licence to a corporation, the Commission will need to be satisfied that the persons who will be performing the claims management function on its behalf are likely to be able to meet the standards imposed by the Commission for the management of claims and the rehabilitation of injured employees. Licensed corporations will also be required to comply with any direction of the Commission, either generally or in respect of a particular matter or class of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will be able to impose conditions on a corporation's licence which are similar to those which may apply to a Commonwealth authority. For example, to ensure that employees of licensed corporations receive an independent assessment of their claims, a licence may be subject to a condition that the reconsideration of claims made by a corporation's employees be carried out by employees of the Commonwealth or by a Comcare subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Licensed corporations and Comcare subsidiaries will be required to determine claims for compensation in the same manner as Comcare. That is, they are to be guided by equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees of licensed corporations who are dissatisfied with decisions made in relation to their claims will be able to seek review of those decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the same way as employees of the Commonwealth. The Bill contains several amendments to part 6 of the Act to allow this to occur. The respondent in such proceedings will be the licensed corporation. However, Comcare will be entitled to become a party to proceedings involving licensed corporations and, to ensure consistency of representations made to tribunals and the courts, the Commission may direct the corporation not to put certain submissions to a tribunal or the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare will not become directly involved in the administration of claims made by employees of licensed corporations. Claims management services provided by Comcare to either class A or class B licence holders will be undertaken by subsidiaries of Comcare. These subsidiaries will have their own board of management and separate accounts, and will be subject to the same taxation and regulatory requirements applying to private sector corporations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare subsidiaries will be audited by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of class B licensed corporations, Comcare subsidiaries will have to compete with other parties for the right to perform claims management functions.

<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing to the House a package of legislation comprising the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Bill 1992. Together, these Bills provide for triennial funding for vocational education and training and the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two measures give effect to the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to establish the new national vocational education and training system, of which the new Authority will be the centrepiece.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement provides for the national system to take full effect from 1 January 1994. Considerable preparation will be required to ensure that the new planning and funding arrangements are properly in place by that date.

This will allow the Authority to become operational early in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national system, and the creation of the National Authority, mark a significant stage in Australia's development as a clever and a capable country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, the vocational education and training sector will have a secure funding base on which to plan. State governments have agreed to at least maintain their current effort for vocational education and training on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this package of legislation, the Government honours its own commitment in One Nation to provide secure and substantial funding for vocational education and training on a triennial basis. The Commonwealth will maintain the level of financial support for vocational education and training currently paid through States grants arrangements, incorporating within the base the extra $100m provided through the November 1991 economic statement. In addition, the Commonwealth will provide real growth of $70m a year in 1993, 1994 and 1995, bringing the Commonwealth's additional expenditure on vocational education and training during the triennium to $720m. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority will also receive vocational education and training funds from the Commonwealth and from the States and, on the basis of the national allocation principles determined by the ministerial council, will allocate and pay those funds to the States, or to other parties where appropriate. It will play a key role in the overall planning of vocational education and training, from a national perspective, and administer any national programs assigned to it by the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central aim of the new national system will be to promote closer, more effective interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers. I have referred to the industry representation on the board of the Authority. In addition, this Bill provides for consultation between the Authority and industry, including the Industry Training Advisory Body network and representatives of industries, employers and trade unions. There is also provision in the statement for industry involvement at the State level in key aspects of the national system, including in the development of State training profiles and the provision of input to the national strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority's functions are set out in the Australian National Training Authority Bill 1992, to which I now turn. This Bill establishes the Australian National Training Authority and sets out the framework for its operations within the national system. The Authority will have the functions ascribed to it in the agreed 21 July statement, which are set out in the Bill, and in particular in clause 6 of part 2. Clause 6 also foreshadows the conferring of functions on the Authority by State governments, which have signalled their intention to introduce during 1993 complementary legislation related to the national system. In performing its functions, the Authority will be subject to the terms of the statement and to directions of the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the arrangements set out in part 3 of the Bill for the allocation and payment of funds. The Commonwealth and the States have agreed to pass their vocational education and training funds to the Authority. Consistent with the provisions of the statement, the Commonwealth has also agreed to pass to the Authority certain national programs currently administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money paid to the Authority will form a pool for allocation by the Authority in accordance with national allocation principles determined by the ministerial council. In recognition of the importance of maintaining the capital facilities and infrastructure for this sector, the Bill specifically provides that the ministerial council may determine that part of the money paid by the Commonwealth to the Authority is for allocation for expenditure of a capital nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once allocated by the Authority, the funds will be paid according to the arrangements agreed by heads of government. Each State will receive an amount not less than the sum of the amount paid to the Authority by the State and the amount of Commonwealth vocational education and training funds paid to the State by the Authority in the preceding year, excluding amounts paid specifically for expenditure on national projects or on capital. These arrangements guarantee planning certainty for the States. A State will qualify for additional Commonwealth growth funds only once its training profile has been agreed by the ministerial council. This helps to ensure that additional Commonwealth funds are spent in accordance with the agreed national objectives and the national strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that the Authority may also allocate and pay funds to other parties for expenditure on national programs or national projects. Consistent with the terms of the statement, a clear aim of the national system will be the promotion of a more effective training market, comprising public and private provision of advanced technical training and further education opportunities. Money paid by the Authority to a State may also be used for the provision of places through either public or private providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the Bill contains provisions for public accountability on the funding and performance of the national vocational education and training system. Each State will be required to provide the Authority with an audited financial statement on the expenditure of funds paid by the Authority. The Authority will submit to the ministerial council a draft annual national report on the performance of the vocational education and training system. Once approved, the annual national report would be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the Bill provides for the Authority's finances. The Commonwealth has agreed to meet the Authority's establishment and running costs. The initial operating budget will be determined when the Authority's size and structure have been established, probably early in 1993. The Authority's running costs needs will be considered within the Government's annual Budget context, on the basis of estimates prepared by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the administrative provisions relating to the Authority, which will consist of five members, including a chairperson and deputy chairperson. Members will be pointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the ministerial council for a period of up to three years, and could be re-appointed. Members could be appointed on a full time or a part time basis. The ministerial council has agreed that, for the foreseeable future, members will be appointed part time but that the flexibility to allow for a full time appointment should be maintained. Division 1 of part 6 also sets out standard provisions for remuneration, allowances and other benefits for board members. The Authority will meet as required to perform its functions. Three members will be required to form a quorum at a meeting, and at least three votes would be required to decide any matter at a meeting of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the provisions of part 7 of the Bill, which relate to the chief executive officer and staff of the Authority. The chief executive officer will be appointed by the Authority after consultation with the ministerial council. Once again, there are standard provisions for remuneration, allowances and other benefits. The provisions of division 2 of part 7, which relate to the staff of the Authority, reflect the nature of the Authority as a Commonwealth statutory authority, accountable to a council of Commonwealth and State Ministers and assuming responsibility for some programs currently administered by a Commonwealth department. </PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased to introduce to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), a Bill which provides further measures to consolidate the Government's support for elderly people living in hostels and nursing homes. The first of these measures involves amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act to allow for the introduction of sanctions against hostels which fail to comply with standards of care and quality of life for residents and also the establishment of hostel standards review panels. These amendments bring hostels into line with nursing homes, where the Commonwealth can take action in circumstances where nursing home proprietors are not providing residents with the quality of life and care which frail older members of the Australian community deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As occurs in respect of nursing homes, standards monitoring teams now assess compliance of hostels against gazetted standards. These standards were developed by a committee which had representatives from State governments, industry, union and consumer organisations, and they have been in effect since 1 January 1991. The proposed amendments provide the Commonwealth with the ability to suspend payment to an organisation operating a hostel if that hostel is not complying with the standards. The suspension applies only to hostel places which are or become unoccupied after the Minister makes a declaration that the hostel does not comply with the standards. The effect of this action is that the hostel does not receive additional financial assistance for new residents.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will also provide a peer review mechanism for a hostel operator who seeks review of the assessment of the hostel's compliance with standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the majority of hostels for frail older persons are providing a high level of care, there are unfortunately some which could provide better standards of care. In extreme cases, financial sanctions can be imposed. The Government's experience with nursing homes is that there is a significant improvement in the performance of nursing homes which are not complying with standards only after the Department has written to the proprietor and told him that a declaration of failure to meet the standards will be served. It is at this juncture, with the introduction of the measures in this Bill, that the hostel operator will be able to seek a review from a hostel standards review panel. These panels will have members from the industry who are senior managers and command respect and stature among their peers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act permit the Minister to make orders providing for the membership and conduct of the panels. If the panel recommends to the Minister that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, it may also recommend that the Commonwealth suspend the payment of financial assistance to the hostel for new residents. A similar sanction has been available in parallel circumstances for nursing home proprietors since 1991. In that time, the Department has taken this course of action against 12 nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also seeks to amend the National Health Act in order to implement a 1992-93 Budget initiative providing funding to upgrade nursing homes. There is considerable variation in the standards of accommodation offered in nursing homes. Many nursing home proprietors, while aiming to provide good quality care, have difficulty in meeting the Government's outcome standards or health and fire safety standards because they are operating in old or unsuitable buildings. The initiative in this Bill will enable nursing home proprietors to undertake substantial upgrading work which has been identified as necessary for the well-being of their residents but which they might not otherwise be able to afford. It provides an incentive for substantial upgrading that will improve the quality of care provided to the nursing home residents, and hence their quality of life. The benefit will be paid as a monthly recurrent benefit over a period of 10 years and will be calculated in accordance with a formula based on a maximum cost per bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, with regard to aged care measures, the Bill seeks to amend the National Health Act to make provision for a nursing home adviser to be appointed to a nursing home that has breached the conditions of approval for approved nursing homes. The legislative amendment gives nursing homes which may otherwise be closed an opportunity to improve their performance. The role of the adviser will be to assist the proprietor of the home to comply with the conditions of approval and will usually be someone with experience in the management of aged care facilities. If the proprietor is unwilling to accept and pay for an adviser, then the normal sanctions process would continue, including closing the home if that becomes necessary. The proprietor of the home will continue to be responsible for the management of the home under the National Health Act, and the adviser will have no legal responsibility or liability under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes amendments to the Health Insurance Act to rectify an anomaly in the legislation that prejudices pathology practices which merge. Currently when two and more pathology practices merge, the resulting approved pathology authority, APA, that emerges loses the right to temporary licensed collection centres. A limited number of temporary licences are available to APAs for collection centres they operated prior to the restructuring amendments. Temporary licences are a transition arrangement that operates until 1 February 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a desirable outcome of the 1991 budgetary changes that APAs merge or are absorbed by other APAs, thereby reducing the excess capacity which provides an incentive to overservice. These amendments seek to remove a disincentive for mergers. In addition, the amendment ensures that the Minister's power to vary or revoke a determination of the maximum number of licensed collection centres which an approved pathology authority may operate is not restricted by the operation of section 23DNC of the principal Act. On behalf of the Minister, I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes a significant amendment to the National Health Act 1953. There are two main parts to the Bill. Firstly, a fundamental change to the payment scheme for Commonwealth nursing home benefits is proposed, to enable the recovery of overadvanced benefit. Secondly, the Bill proposes the introduction of a series of measures designed to further protect the rights of the Commonwealth and of purchasers when a nursing home is sold or transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nursing home funding system has always embraced an element of cost reimbursement. That is, funds are advanced to proprietors during the year and then at the end of the year that advanced funding is acquitted against the costs actually incurred by the proprietors in providing nursing home care. This means that, where a proprietor spends less on providing nursing home care than was advanced during the year, the amount of unspent or overadvanced funding must be repaid to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By virtue of the existing legislation, such overadvanced funds are not legally characterised as debts to the Commonwealth and can only be recovered by an offset or `negative fee loading' to the approved daily nursing home fee and, by extension, the amount of Commonwealth benefit otherwise payable each month.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amounts of overadvanced benefit are not recoverable debts has caused some difficulty. For example, where a proprietor accrues a liability to the Commonwealth for overadvanced funding and then sells the home, that proprietor cannot be pursued for the money after sale. Rather, the Commonwealth is obliged to recover the money from the benefit paid to the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is well aware of such arrangements and makes appropriate provisions in contracts for sale. Further, following an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 in the autumn 1992 sittings of the Parliament, financial information about a home can be disclosed to potential purchasers without having to rely on the cooperation of the proprietor to obviate the secrecy provisions. Purchasers are, therefore, generally protected and able to make informed decisions when buying a home. Nonetheless, problems still occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment changes the nature of the funding system so that the person who accrues the liability can be pursued for the money&mdash;overadvanced benefit will be legally characterised as a debt to the Commonwealth and will be recoverable through the courts. However, this Bill only changes the system prospectively. Benefits paid prior to the introduction of this change are not subject to its provisions and the existing system of recovery by fee loading will continue to exist in respect of benefits paid up to 1 July 1993 and until proprietors' claims for funding for those earlier periods are finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other aspects to the current scheme which offer problems for both the Commonwealth and purchasers when a nursing home is sold or transferred. There is, for example, no real requirement for notice of sale to be given by either party. Where the Commonwealth gets any notice at all, there may be little time in which to finalise funding for the home, determine overpayments, ensure that prospective purchasers understand the funding system and are as far as possible able to make an informed decision about their purchase and to do those other things to ensure a smooth transition in ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the amount owed to the Commonwealth is not able to be recovered at the point of sale, but must be recovered from the purchaser after sale, although this will be partially addressed by the proposed changes to the benefits payment system already described. This Bill introduces a mechanism for the sale or transfer of nursing homes which addresses these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proprietors, the vendors in the transaction, will be required to give notice of sale and will be deterred from completing the sale within 90 days of giving notice. Purchasers will also be required to give notice of their intent. The period of notice will enable the vendor's claims, books and records to be scrutinised so that, prior to completion, a fair estimate may be made of any overpayment and any anticipated fee loading which relate to the period up until sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to or at completion of the sale, the purchaser will be required to pay to the Commonwealth from the purchase price the amount of the estimated overpayment. Such payments will be deemed to be paid to the vendor as consideration under the contract of sale. If the amount paid by the purchaser is less than the estimated overpayment, the vendor will be required to make up the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any amounts paid by the purchaser or vendor prior to completion will be held in trust by the Commonwealth pending final determination of the overpayment. The amount of any anticipated fee loading will be advised to both parties so that appropriate provisions can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after completion of the sale, the actual overpayment relating to the period up until sale will be determined. Any amount held in trust by the Commonwealth will then be acquitted against the actual overpayment. If a greater amount is held in trust, the balance will be paid to the vendor. If a lesser amount is held, the outstanding amount will be recoverable as a debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mechanism is also flexible enough to address varying circumstances. Three separate approaches are provided for three different degrees of notice of the sale: more than 90 days, less than 90 days and no notice. In addition to imposing statutory obligations on both parties to a sale, as well as the Commonwealth, the amendments provide for the imposition of penalties for failing to comply with certain obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes afford greater protection of the rights of the Commonwealth to money owed to it, and the rights of purchasers to information about the home they are buying and to a home unencumbered by liabilities accrued by the previous owner.

These were its relative simplicity and flexibility to meet a wide variety of community needs and its capacity to take into account the particular cultural needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members that both these qualities remain untarnished. So, too, does the Act's capacity to provide groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with an inexpensive and straightforward means of gaining incorporation. While Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups can choose to be incorporated under various forms of State and Territory legislation, incorporation under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act has proved a popular option. There has been a growth in the number of incorporated associations since the commencement of the Act in 1978, reaching approximately 1,600 at 30 September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement that government funding to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups must be by way of grants to incorporated bodies has been a powerful incentive for groups to seek incorporation. The Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has repeatedly made it clear that accountability for the expenditure of funds provided to Aboriginal community organisations through the Commission is not negotiable. The ATSIC commissioners have done this, for example, by requiring the acquittal by funded organisations of all previous grants before the release of further funds to an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this, the Commissioners are reflecting the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the community level who recognise that public accountability for expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is not only a legitimate concern of governments, it is also the right and expectation of Aboriginal people who are the clients of funded organisations. However, the Act has not provided the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations with the means to ensure compliance with the obligations of incorporation. The amendments contained in this Bill are designed to assist the Office of the Registrar in the more effective enforcement of compliance with the Act, and in particular to protect the rights of members of associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended in its historic report that, in the implementation of any policy or program which will particularly affect Aboriginal people, the delivery of the program should as a matter of preference be made by such Aboriginal organisations as are appropriate&mdash;recommendation 192. That recommendation of the Royal Commission was supported by all Australian governments, State, Territory and Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission also recognised that governments were entitled to require a proper system of accounting for funds provided to Aboriginal communities and organisations. The provisions contained in this Bill reflect the desire of the Government for proper standards of accountability in the expenditure of public funds. Equally importantly, however, these provisions also reflect the expectation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that funded organisations will manage resources made available to them in an effective and efficient manner and in the interests of the communities they serve. That expectation can only be met if associations are required to meet high standards of public accountability in the management of their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who take positions on the governing committees of these associations have very serious responsibilities and are doing great service for their communities. Frequently they carry the additional burdens of limited education and management experience. They are deserving of considerable support in these roles, including having clearly stated for them the requirements of incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no acceptable alternative to the establishment of honesty and clear and open accountability as the guiding principles for the conduct of the affairs of these incorporated associations. To accept anything less is to deny Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities a chance for a better life. We must not risk undermining the whole strategy of Aboriginal self-management through the erosion of public confidence in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act is an important tool in the Government's hand for ensuring accountability and transparency in the operations of incorporated bodies. Unfortunately many of its compliance and accountability provisions have proved to be blunt and unwieldy in their application. The central purpose of the amendments contained in this Bill is to correct these deficiencies in the Act. The amendments will strengthen the obligations of the governing committees and the corresponding rights of the members of incorporated associations in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 10 will make the rules of an association have the effect of a contract between the association, its members, the members of the governing committee and the public officer;</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 11 will provide for the disqualification from being on governing committees of people with convictions for offences involving fraud or misappropriation of funds, the requirement for committee members to disclose pecuniary interests, to act honestly and diligently and the requirement for committee members to vacate office in the event of becoming bankrupt;</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 13 will require governing committees to call and conduct annual general meetings and special general meetings as provided in the association's rules; and</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 14 will require that the committee's and examiner's reports, which the governing committee is required to produce, will be made available at annual general meetings and for inspection by members of associations. </PARA>
<PARA>Another set of amendments is aimed at ensuring that governing committees do not run the affairs of associations without due regard for the wishes of the members, and avoiding fragmentation of community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 9 will enable the Registrar to refuse to issue a certificate of incorporation to an association if the rules do not give members an effective degree of control over the running of the association;</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 9 will provide that associations which are not formed wholly for business purposes, or to hold title to land or a leasehold interest, will be required to have at least 25 members; and</PARA>
<PARA>.Clause 12 will require that governing committees provide the Registrar with updated lists of membership of associations. This should clarify situations when the Registrar is obliged to act as an arbitrator in disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these amendments will either confer new rights or clarify and strengthen existing rights of members of associations and ensure that governing committees conduct the affairs of associations honestly, openly and in the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the communities in which they operate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will streamline and strengthen the powers of the Registrar to take action against corporations which are in breach of their obligations under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major deficiency in the Act is the limitation on the Registrar regarding the power to act as an arbitrator in disputes. Clause 13 will provide the Registrar with specific powers to act in the role of an arbitrator of disputes and includes the ability to require governing committees to call and conduct annual general meetings and special general meetings. This should be a means by which matters can be resolved before they develop into damaging and time consuming disruptions to the affairs of associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 16 will provide procedures by which the Registrar may investigate the affairs of an association. These are now considerably streamlined. Instead of having to engage registered company auditors for all investigations, the Registrar can appoint an authorised person to examine the documents of an association. The person may well be a qualified auditor in some situations, but in many situations, such qualifications would not be required. This can provide both a saving in costs and a greater ability to act quickly and with flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 17 will give the Registrar power to apply for injunctions where the Registrar considers that an association is not complying with a provision of the Act, the regulations or the association's rules. This procedure replaces a more complicated procedure involving the issue of several notices on the association, prior to any legal action being taken regarding its non-compliance with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the Act under which the Registrar can apply to the court to appoint a judicial manager are replaced by clause 23, which will give the Registrar powers to appoint an administrator. This again will give the Registrar more flexibility and the ability to act more quickly when there are requirements that the affairs of an association be placed under special management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this Bill will make it easier to achieve better accountability without placing onerous burdens on the governing committees of incorporated associations.

<PARA>Over the past few years this Government has publicly shown a strong commitment to the protection of endangered species. A vital component of this position has been a public commitment to the consideration of the enactment of Commonwealth endangered species legislation. This Bill is the result of that commitment and will form the legislative component of the Government's ongoing action to protect endangered species. The Bill is also in response to the widespread view expressed by the Australian public that endangered species are a national problem that requires Commonwealth Government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extinction of species is, of course, a natural part of the evolutionary process. However, in the 200 years since European settlement the rate of extinction in Australia has accelerated dramatically. This increase is not, as some believe, an event associated only with the early days of settlement, when our scientific knowledge of the Australian environment and our impacts on it were far more limited than they are today. Extinctions and endangered species are very much a current problem. Half of all our animal extinctions have occurred this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists agree that Australia has right now 226 species and sub-species of plants and 73 of animals which are endangered; that is, they are in immediate danger of extinction. A further 661 species and sub-species of plants and 66 of animals are vulnerable; that is, they are likely to become endangered if present threats continue. On the international level also, the Bill will demonstrate that Australia is taking action to address endangered species conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not alone in our efforts to save endangered species. Many other countries, including Japan and the United States, have already taken legislative action to protect endangered species, with the need already reflected within the recently concluded Convention on Biological Diversity and agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Within Australia, a number of States and Territories have introduced, or are in the process of introducing endangered species legislation. All of this action only makes it more important for the Commonwealth Government to proceed with the enactment of its own endangered species legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have often said, endangered species do not recognise State boundaries. What is needed for their proper protection and management is a national perspective. We need nationally agreed lists of what species are endangered and vulnerable, and a national approach to plans for their recovery. Of course, it is essential that the lists are prepared on a scientific basis and that the scientists advising the Minister are free to make their decisions without the pressure of other influences on their decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the legislation has been subject to extensive consultation over a long period. The legislation was first mooted by the Government in March 1990. The Endangered Species Advisory Committee provided me with an options paper on endangered species legislation in April 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extensive consultation with all relevant interest groups including industry, conservation organisations and the States and Territories followed during the development of the Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill addresses such fundamental issues as the scientific process for listing endangered and vulnerable species and the development of recovery and threat abatement plans for their protection. I believe that the major focus of the legislation is its positive and proactive approach to endangered species and their long term survival in Australia. Some critics, having focused on the regulatory aspects, which are in reality of limited extent, appear to have overlooked its predominantly positive approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has the following key features: national lists of endangered and vulnerable species and endangered ecological communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has been developed in the context of ecologically sustainable development and it accords with the basic principles of ESD.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all must remember that once a species is lost, it is lost forever. But there is much we can do to prevent that.

<PARA>In his Budget statement to this House dated 18 August the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced that the export market development grants scheme, the EMDG scheme, was to be extended, effective from 1 July 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of amended legislation, effective 1 July 1990, exporters have generally been limited to a maximum of eight EMD grants. This limitation arose from the recommendations of the 1989 Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance, known as the Hughes Committee, which suggested, amongst other things, that exporters place less emphasis on EMDG assistance, with fewer firms pushing into new markets, after having received eight grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of approved bodies and approved trading houses, the eight grant cut-off has been a total and final exclusion from the scheme, regardless of the merits of future market prospects and products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change to the scheme, along with others, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of exporters with access to EMDG. Quite a number of those firms excluded clearly do have a lot to offer by way of new marketing initiatives. These may be existing product to a market which previously had not been considered, or a completely new product. Whilst Austrade does administer other financial assistance schemes which cover specific initiatives of exporters, such as the innovative agricultural marketing program and the international trade enhancement scheme, these schemes are either limited to particular industries, or only cater for larger projects and initiatives. </PARA>

This threshold is increased to $1m in the case of a limited number of specified larger scale development project service activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill introduces amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 which will detail more precisely, for the guidance of decision makers, the steps involved in and the manner of determining whether or not an injury, disease or death is war caused or defence caused under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The amendments will set out how the standard of proof and reasonable hypothesis provisions are to operate in making such a determination when a claim for pension relates to operational, peacekeeping or hazardous service. They will not change in any way the existing eligibility criteria for either disability or service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendments will be to reverse the effect of the decision of the High Court of Australia in Bushell v. Repatriation Commission, handed down by the court on 7 October 1992. The amendments will return to the position that was intended to apply to the determination of claims following the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986 and which the Repatriation Commission had understood had been endorsed by a number of leading decisions of the Federal Court, including the Full Bench of the Federal Court in East v. Repatriation Commission and the majority of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v. Bushell itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of proof provisions in both the Veterans' Entitlements Act and its forerunner, the Repatriation Act 1920, have been the subject of considerable litigation and legislative change since the beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof was inserted into the Repatriation Act in 1977. Those changes were introduced by the then Government notwithstanding express comments in the 1975 Toose report against the applicability of the criminal standard to pension proceedings. The High Court, in Law's case in 1981, held that those words amounted to the criminal standard of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must stress, of course, that the criminal standard of proof does not mean proof beyond all shadow of a doubt, but the O'Brien High Court decision in 1985 virtually amounted to this&mdash;hence the 1985 changes to the legislation to overcome that decision. The second reading speech made on that occasion set out in detail the reasons for those changes and much of the recent history of the legislation. The 1985 changes introduced the requirement that a reasonable hypothesis of the relevant war service connection must exist before a claim could be granted. The comments made in that 1985 speech are relevant to this Bill. I also refer honourable members to the detailed explanatory memorandum which accompanies this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986, the Repatriation Act 1920 was repealed and replaced by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. A substantial measure of consensus as to the form of the standard of proof provision, section 120, was reached with the ex-service community. It made significant changes to the 1985 amendments and was intended to have the following effect:</PARA>
<PARA>.first, a reasonable hypothesis, and the facts founding it, were to be determined only after all the material had been considered and evaluated. That is, an end of the day test was involved;</PARA>
<PARA>.secondly, a single stage process was envisaged. Satisfaction of the reasonable hypothesis was intended to be taken as satisfaction of the beyond reasonable doubt standard. If a reasonable hypothesis was established, the relevant war service connection was held to exist and the claim was allowed. If not, the claim would be rejected. The 1985 dispelling provisions were removed; and</PARA>
<PARA>.thirdly, no onus of proof was cast either on the claimant or on the Repatriation Commission, and no presumption of entitlement was conferred on a claimant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions were intended to ensure that the well-reasoned AAT decision in the O'Brien case, which was upheld by Brennan J. in his minority judgment in that case, would be valid if made under the new legislation. The Bushell case involved similar medical issues as O'Brien and was rejected at all three levels of the determining system; that is, by the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as by the Full Bench of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the 1986 legislation was followed by a comprehensive AAT decision in the case of East, upheld by the Full Bench of the Federal Court. This is considered to have confirmed generally the intention behind the changes to the legislation. The High Court refused special leave to appeal from the Federal Court's decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now clear, however, from the Bushell decision that the 1986 provisions are not sufficiently comprehensive to achieve their intention. The result of the decision is  that satisfaction of the reasonable hypothesis test does not exhaust the beyond reasonable doubt test. It was held to be a threshold test rather than, as intended, a test which is conclusive of the question whether the relevant war service connection exists. That is, a reasonable hypothesis can now be raised on only some of the material, without an evaluation or analysis of all the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same applies to the facts that are required to support the hypothesis. They can be inferred on only some of the evidence and must be disproved beyond reasonable doubt if their existence, and that of the reasonable hypothesis, is to be rejected. The O'Brien decision established that this will be impossible in most cases. Additionally, the High Court held in Bushell that a reasonable hypothesis could be raised where it was supported merely by a responsible medical practitioner speaking within the ambit of that practitioner's expertise, even though it might be an opinion against the weight of informed medical opinion, or have little support in the medical profession or among scientists, or have been discarded by medical opinion for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of such an interpretation would be that the only cases which will not succeed are those where there is no evidence, or the only evidence is to the contrary of the relevant service, injury or disease, or where no medical practitioner or other expert is willing to suggest an hypothesis linking the injury, disease or death with service. Such cases are rare. In a recent case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, after quoting at length from Bushell, relied on the opinion of a paramedical person, who was not a qualified doctor, in preference to the opinions of three medical specialists. The AAT found that a heart condition and anxiety disorder were war-caused when the veteran had a total of less than four days of operational service, over a three-month period, in which he was not involved in any combat. This amounts to a return of the O'Brien situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As highlighted in the 1985 second reading speech, the comprehensive three-tiered determining system was hardly a sign that there was to be virtual automatic acceptance of disability and war widows' claims. The anticipated impact of the decision is that there will be a large increase in the Department's expenditure on disability pensions, war widows' pensions and associated treatment costs. However, there is an issue of more fundamental concern. As the Acting Minister said in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has always been accepted that the repatriation pension system should be generous. Nevertheless generosity seems to have gone beyond reasonable bounds.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian repatriation system is already the most beneficial in the world. The recent decision goes far beyond what was intended in 1986 and provides benefits in circumstances where no reasonable person would believe them to be appropriate. The provision of benefits in such circumstances raises real questions of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members of a statement made in 1988 by the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee, which was established to review the first 12 months operation of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In commenting on a Federal Court decision which has now been revived by the Bushell case, the Committee stated that no legislative action should be taken to overrule that decision unless, in subsequent decisions to the same effect, it was found that the 1985 amendments were being frustrated and, in particular, that the effect of the High Court decision in O'Brien had not been negated. It is significant to note that the Committee was chaired by the Hon. Paul Toose, CBE, QC, and included representatives from the Returned Services League of Australia, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, and a former chairman of the Legacy Coordinating Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation contemplated by the Monitoring Committee has now arisen. Legislative action is necessary. The existing `beyond reasonable doubt' terminology of section 120 will be retained in its present form, but its effect will be clarified by amendments to accord with the intended effect I have referred to earlier. In addition, a new section, 119A, will be inserted setting out both the order and manner in which the relevant facts and causation issue will be decided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main effects of the proposed amendments will be threefold:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">first, they will ensure that all relevant facts must be found before proceeding to determine the causation issue under subsection 120(1), that is, whether the injury, disease or death is war-caused. If any essential facts are found not to exist, the causation issue will not arise and the claim cannot proceed. The findings in respect of both the facts and the causation issue are to take place in a structured manner and on the basis of a full examination, assessment and evaluation of all the evidence. It will not be a question of raising the existence of a necessary fact or hypothesis on the basis of only some of the evidence, with the Commission having to dispel the fact or hypothesis beyond reasonable doubt;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">secondly, they will ensure that the establishment of a reasonable hypothesis connecting the incapacity or death with war service is a single, `end of the day' process which exhausts the requirements of the `beyond reasonable doubt' test, and is  not itself required to be dispelled beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be achieved by significant changes to the words of existing subsection 120(3) and by the insertion of a note to subsection 120(1). The changes to subsection (3) will eliminate any interpretation of the existing words that the `raising' of a reasonable hypothesis `after consideration of the whole of the material' merely means the `raising' of an hypothesis on some of the evidence after completion of the gathering of all the evidence. The changes will confirm that the hypothesis has to be `established', not merely `raised', and that this is to be `on the basis of all the material' after a comprehensive evaluation of that material in accordance with the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Thirdly, they will define the circumstances in which an hypothesis of a connection with war service will not be regarded as reasonable. These will include, for example, circumstances where the hypothesis is fanciful, speculative, unreal, tenuous or remote, or is not grounded in the particular circumstances of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the amendments will overturn the effect of the Bushell decision that a medical opinion may raise a reasonable hypothesis even though it is not generally accepted as being reasonable by expert medical or scientific opinion. An hypothesis will not be reasonable in these circumstances, nor if it is outweighed by a more persuasive and compelling expert opinion, or by a greater substantial body of expert opinion. A decision-maker, therefore, will be required to conduct a thorough evaluation of, and to form a view upon, the medical and scientific opinion, rather than merely identify whether a purported reasonable hypothesis is supported by a responsible medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention to the fact that a report by the Auditor-General on compensation for veterans and war widows should be finalised and tabled in the next few weeks. The audit report is expected to raise fundamental issues which will require long and careful examination, hopefully on a bipartisan basis. Changes to the legislation to reverse the Bushell decision cannot, however, await that examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there would be no additional or reduced expenditure flowing from this Bill, if the effects of the High Court's decision were not legislatively overturned by the measures contained in it, the estimated additional program costs would be $10m to $15m in 1992-93, $60m to $105m in 1993-94, $80m to $135m in 1994-95 and $100m to $180m in 1995-96. The increased costs by the financial year 2001-02 would be $235m to $440m. By that time, the accumulated cost for the first 10 years would be $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion. The financial implications of not proceeding with legislative action are, therefore, very significant; so too, as I have said, are the equitable considerations. I assure honourable members that these amendments will not affect, but are designed to protect, the legitimate claims and rights of the veteran community which will continue to be guaranteed by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act will continue to provide that, in determining any claim, a determining authority is required to act according to substantial justice and the merits and all the circumstances of the case. The Act will continue to take account of the difficulties that lie in the way of ascertaining facts, including for any reason attributable to the effects of the passage of time, the availability of witnesses, or any deficiency in official records. Furthermore, once any hypothesis is found to be reasonable, the claim must succeed, even if medical opinion is that the hypothesised connection is not the most likely cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also stress that the Government is being even-handed in its treatment of court decisions which it believes at the time to be inconsistent with equity and the intention of the legislation. I remind honourable members that when the Federal Court held that T&amp;PI pensioners could, contrary to established practice, have their pensions automatically revoked at age 65, the Government acted very quickly to legislate to preserve the previous position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I reiterate the Government's commitment generally to the continuation of generous and effective benefits and treatment for those who suffer because of their war service for Australia. Australia has by far the most comprehensive and generous repatriation benefits in the world. After the Bill I have introduced becomes law, this will still be the position, and this Bill's effect of preventing an escalation in costs will help to ensure that expenditure is directed to the legitimate needs and priorities of our veterans and war widows. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is to impose a charge on those adults who apply for certain visas and entry permits and who will need instruction in the English language. The Bill also provides scope for charging people who are already resident in Australia and who enrol in courses arranged under the Commonwealth-funded adult migrant English program. The charges are in two forms: up to a maximum of $4,080 for applicants from 1 January 1993 who are issued visas or entry permits after 1 March 1993; and up to $250 a year for current residents enrolling or re-enrolling in adult migrant English courses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these commitments demonstrate, the Government recognises that proficiency in English is an essential part of Australian life.

<PARA>On 5 May this year, during the debate on the Migration Amendment Act 1992, I foreshadowed to the House that I would be recommending a comprehensive program of legislative amendments to ensure that our migration law is the best mechanism available to deal with current issues and needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has already been the author of significant reform of immigration policies and laws. In 1989 my predecessor, Senator Robert Ray, took a major step towards legislative implementation of the recommendations of the CAAIP report. In spite of the 1989 reforms, a major issue confronting the Government is border control. There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country. Some do this by trying to avoid immigration processing altogether by arriving in Australia without authority. The boat people are a good example. Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here, even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law. This must stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Migration Reform Bill currently before the House I propose a range of measures to enhance the Government's control of people who wish to cross our borders. The Bill sets out more effective means of regulating entry, detention and removal of people who do not establish an entitlement to be in Australia. The reforms are complemented by an enhanced scheme of independent merits review rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A primary objective of the Migration Act is to regulate, in the national interest, the entry and presence in Australia of persons who are not Australian citizens. The Government views it as essential that all provisions and policies under the Act be interpreted in a way which furthers this objective. An objects provision will be inserted in the Act to remind the community, the administrators and the courts of this intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the reforms, a non-citizen will require a single authority&mdash;a visa&mdash;to travel to, enter or remain in Australia. All non-citizens will be brought within the one visa system. However, limited categories of non-citizens, in particular New Zealanders, will still be able to travel to Australia without a visa and enter with the same degree of convenience as at present. Upon arrival, all persons, including Australian citizens, will be required to present themselves for immigration clearance. Australian citizens will be required to use their Australian passport or other acceptable evidence of Australian citizenship when leaving or entering Australia. These measures will streamline identification of non-citizens entering Australia and will reduce the prospect of evasion of immigration controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, we have an array of laws which govern detention and removal, depending upon how a person arrived in Australia.

Credible independent merits review will ensure that the Government's clear intentions in relation to controlling entry to Australia, as set out in the Migration Act, are not eroded by narrow judicial interpretations. Under the Reform Bill, the following people who are adversely affected by a decision will be entitled to independent merits review: onshore refugee claimants; onshore cancelled visa holders, except those cancelled at the border; onshore applicants for a visa, except those detected at the border; and an Australian sponsor of an offshore applicant for a visa. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly explain why I am introducing these changes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout my political life I have believed that government, working in partnership with the community, can bring about change&mdash;change for the good and changes which make a difference to our society and how we view ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in 1990 I consulted widely with community organisations on the new refugee determination procedures, particularly the inclusion of a community representative on the Refugee Status Review Committee and the new natural justice procedures. At the time, this decision was widely applauded. However, when we started seeing negative decisions coming out of the Committee, the goal posts suddenly moved. The Committee was branded as an arm of the Government, the Government was criticised as having a fixed view and the system was declared as being unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, when the Government acted quickly to introduce fast tracking of new refugee cases, this was believed to be a good move. The fast tracking system has been a success and we are starting to see results. Amazingly, however, I am now being criticised for processing some cases too quickly. I reject totally such claims about the Committee and the fast track processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly three years ago I also met with a group of people who claimed to support the Cambodian asylum seekers. They were lawyers, local politicians and community workers. They came to me and said they were concerned with the way that my Department had processed these people's applications and asked that they be done again. They also wanted the asylum seekers to be given access to legal representation. I agreed to this request because I believe that it is better to make sure that the decision making is beyond reproach and open to scrutiny. In the spirit of that partnership, I also allowed the community to be part of that process. But what happened? In some cases it took 18 months for applications to be lodged for these asylum seekers while more boats arrived, and still the support groups asked for more time. While they were doing this, what of their clients? They continued to wait in the processing centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enormous energy was put into making wild and fantastic statements about Port Hedland, often by people who had never been there. The tragedy is that people have continued to be housed in Port Hedland and Westbridge, unable to get on with their lives. At the same time, some of those who are supposedly supporting them are more interested in making their reputations as human rights campaigners rather than assisting in a speedy resolution of their cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this period, what sort of advice did they give their clients? I cannot presume to know but I wonder whether they were ever honest with them, whether they gave them realistic, practical advice or whether they were simply fodder for a noble crusade. Some lawyers employed by the Refugee Council of Australia cared about their clients so much that they put up a sign on the door of their interview room which said: `Suicide is just two steps away&mdash;you might as well jump'. What sort of irresponsible, non-thinking person could in the first instance dream up such a slogan and, secondly, display it on the door of a room which was to be used by people who were going to seek that person's advice? My primary responsibility is to make sure that asylum seekers are treated with dignity and fairness. They have a right to expect their cases to be handled fairly and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot be held responsible for the actions of those who provide them with false hope and tempt them into taking drastic and futile measures such as hunger strikes. We must have a system that is clear, predictable and fair and that applies equally to all asylum seekers in Australia. Clients should know what is happening to them and should be able to make informed decisions about their claims and options. The proposals dealing with refugee processing contained in this Bill further strengthen the procedures in two ways: they provide a fair system for the applicant and, at the same time, provide the necessary protection for the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the general migration area, the Immigration Review Tribunal will handle the expanded jurisdiction. In a small number of IRT or RRT cases where an important principle of general application is involved, the principal member of that tribunal will be able to refer the case to a presidential bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The AAT will provide guidance for primary and review decision makers dealing with similar principles in other cases without the disadvantages of delay and expense associated with court appeals. These changes to the migration merit review system broadly accord with views which I have received informally from the Committee to review the system of review of migration decisions. I established this Committee, chaired by a former immigration Minister, the Hon. Ian Macphee, to consider the effectiveness of the merits review system introduced in 1989. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another feature of the Bill should be noted. The Migration Act currently allows a visa to be issued to an accused person who is being extradited to Australia. This Bill introduces a broader scheme to permit entry of not only these people but also others, such as key witnesses who are needed before the courts. The scheme will also ensure that law enforcement agencies have made adequate arrangements for these people while they are in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Bill is part of the migration legislative reforms which will provide more effective measures to detect and remove non-citizens who are unlawfully in Australia. A tax will be imposed on an application for the grant of a visa or entry permit to a non-citizen who has been unlawfully in Australia for 12 months or more. It must be paid before the visa or entry permit may be granted. The tax is intended to serve as an incentive for persons to come forward at an early stage to regularise their status, rather than remaining unlawfully in Australia indefinitely. The tax will be $3,000 for each complete year of unlawful presence in Australia. This amount will be indexed for applications made after the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>

<PARA>This Bill will give effect to the Budget measure announced on 18 August 1992 to tax certain car parking benefits. The Government finds it inequitable that some employees receive these car parking benefits in a tax exempt form while other employees, most of whom will not get a tax deduction for their car parking costs, must pay for equivalent facilities out of their after tax income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to impose fringe benefits tax on certain car parking benefits received by employees.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with agreed triennial funding arrangements, and to reflect changed funding arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth, States and higher education institutions, which will have the effect of increasing the autonomy and flexibility of higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Act provides for Commonwealth higher education funding to be provided to universities through payments made to State governments. In the context of the 1991 review of Commonwealth-State relations, all governments agreed that the funding mechanism for higher education should reflect the reality, that universities are part of a national system of higher education and the Commonwealth has primary responsibility for the public funding of that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was agreement that direct funding from the Commonwealth to higher education institutions is appropriate to improve the accountability and transparency of the Commonwealth to the electorate. The Bill puts this change into effect. From 1993, higher education institutions will be paid direct by the Commonwealth, and institutions rather than the States will be directly accountable to the Commonwealth for the expenditure of grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complement these arrangements and to assist in the accountability process, the Bill includes a statement of the Commonwealth's objectives in higher education. The Bill also provides for payment of higher education funds in limited instances to bodies other than higher education institutions where this best meets the objectives of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new arrangements for direct funding of higher education institutions are accompanied by improved consultative processes so that consideration of State needs and strategies becomes an integral part of the triennial planning cycle. In accordance with these established triennial planning and funding processes, the Bill provides funds for higher education for 1995, the third year of the new funding triennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, the Commonwealth has committed $4.7 billion to higher education in 1995. This amount takes into account the Government's decisions which I have just announced to provide, in 1995, some $23.6m for additional student intakes and $274m for capital purposes, as well as the $252m for research programs already committed. Provision is also made within the 1993-95 funding triennium for a $12m increase in research grants funding in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Government announced in the 1992-93 Budget, from 1994 higher education capital grants are to be incorporated into institutions' general operating grants rather than allocated on a project by project basis. The Bill provides for this decision as well as for the increased resources available in 1993 and 1994 announced in the Budget to address higher education building infrastructure needs. The roll-in of capital funds will provide flexibility, financial stability and continuity for universities in their capital planning. Students should benefit from improved capital facilities as universities are able to manage their resources more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The needs of institutions which are growing at extraordinary rates or which are experiencing significant development and need funds, for example, for new campuses are taken into account in a separate fund for special capital projects. This discretionary pool of funds will be available for allocation by the Commonwealth following consultation with the States and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also reflects other Government decisions on higher education funding announced in its 1992 Budget, in particular the decision to support the establishment of a new open learning program in 1993. This program will open the door to tertiary education for many people currently without access through traditional arrangements. The program will have major advantages for people in rural and remote areas as well as for people with work or family commitments or disabilities which make access to on-campus courses difficult. Arrangements for the operation of this program are well under way and are designed to ensure the quality of open learning provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for an increase in the number of Australian postgraduate research awards available to students annually from 1993, as announced in the Budget. This increase acknowledges that skilled personnel are critical to Australia's research and development efforts and responds to growing demand for awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some minor changes to the higher education contribution scheme are included in the Bill, in particular the increased discount for up-front payment of HECS to apply from 1993, some additional exemptions from HECS so that student places funded by employers are put on the same footing as State-funded places, and some rationalisation of the scheme to ensure that Australian taxpayers do not have to meet the higher education costs of certain groups of students who may never earn an income in Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes protection for the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student organisations, which provide a wide range of services to their members&mdash;counselling, sporting, health and careers services, for example&mdash;are funded mainly by a services and amenities fee collected from students by institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. In the past, some States have interfered with the rights of institutions to make their own decisions about imposing or collecting these fees. The Bill provides an avenue for the Commonwealth to make up any shortfall in revenue experienced by an institution as a result of a decision of this kind by a State. Consequential amendment of the States Grants (General Purposes) legislation will be required at a later date to ensure that the Commonwealth can subsequently recover this money from a State if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes routine cost supplementation for Commonwealth grants to higher education. In total, the Commonwealth is committed to spending some $13.6 billion on higher education over the 1993-95 triennium. This level of funding and the improved funding arrangements put in place represent a major commitment to the enhancement of Australia's higher education system in the interests of present and prospective students and the nation as a whole.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the people of Australia really want to know what is wrong with politics in this country at the moment they would get a very fair indication from the way in which this Bill is being treated, and indeed the way in which some 40, 50, maybe 60 Bills will be treated this week and next week. The Parliament of this country has sunk to a low ebb. It is the responsibility of the Government; the Government manages the Parliament. Frankly, the Government does not have the operation of this Parliament high on its agenda in allowing it to fulfil its proper constitutional role&mdash;the role it ought to have in scrutinising legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at it from that point of view. This is the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992&mdash;in other words, it is the fourth Bill this year correcting other statutes. If the Government had got its act together and done it properly first off, these Bills would not have been necessary. Even though this is the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) for 1992, at the end of its sorry, constricted passage this evening there will be errors which no doubt will have to be fixed by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1993. So we will cascade along next year, fixing up drafting errors because this Government will not allow enough time, debate or consideration to get these things right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to amend eight Acts, including the Bankruptcy Act. We are now amending the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991, which is not even 12 months old. We have already had to come back to amend a Bill which was put through under very similar circumstances&mdash;guillotined through the Parliament&mdash;in 1991 and which has errors in it that now need to be corrected. Indeed, the amendments which are being made in the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) do not even correct the errors which were in the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1991. I will move, in due course, the amendments circulated in my name&mdash;amendments Nos 1 and 2&mdash;which improve the siguation caused by errors which have been left out of this correction which is correcting other errors and which will be accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This indicates the fact that the Opposition takes legislation in this place seriously. We read it and, when we have the opportunity, we improve it. The effect of those amendments will be that annulments of bankruptcy and annulments in relation to compositions of creditors which have to be determined by the court will still be heard in open court. I thank the Government for accepting amendments Nos 1 and 2 which improve this Bill which is correcting errors that should never have occurred in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will also make amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. It will pick up consequential amendments that are necessitated by a Bill which went through the Parliament in 1991 and that were not made then. So we are back here this year picking up consequential amendments that were left out in error then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be doing the same thing in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. A Bill went through last year&mdash;the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991&mdash;which amended various sections of the Freedom of Information Act, but it did not pick up all of the consequential amendments. It was again lacking. It again was not in the form in which it could have been if the legislation had been prepared properly. So this Bill will go through in order to correct some of those errors. We will support the correction of those errors, but the fact is they should never have been made&mdash;and would never have been made if the Government had attended properly to its legislative program; or, indeed, if it could not do that, if it had allowed for proper debate in this Parliament so that the Parliament itself could have scrutinised this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Section 43 of that Act empowers the Federal Court to award costs in proceedings. The proposed amendment in this Bill will prohibit the Federal Court awarding costs against a person represented in representative proceedings brought under part IVA of the Act. An exception will be made in the special circumstances dealt with in sections 33Q and 33R in part IVA and in the case of a proceeding of a representative character commenced under another Act in respect of any provision in the Act to the contrary. </PARA>

Under the amendments that were put by the Government to allow representative or class actions, it is possible that people can be joined into a class and an action can be taken on their behalf. Where such a representative proceeding is taken and lost, the question arises: who bears the cost? This amendment will make it clear that if people have been joined into a class action and are represented in a proceeding which then fails, the costs will not be ordered against them. So even though people can be joined into a court action without their knowledge or consent, at least now they will not be ordered to pay the costs if those court proceedings fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a great admission from the Government, but this piece of legislation was vehemently opposed by the Opposition. When it was debated in this place on 26 November I said it was bad legislation; it was an attack on legal rights. Under our system of law if people want to go to court they will choose to do so. People consent to go to court; they do not get bound up in court proceedings that they have not heard of by reason of the fact that they have not taken steps to get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember standing in the Parliament and raising this exact point. What would be the position of a person who had been joined into a class and an action had been taken and failed? What would be their position in relation to costs? If the Government at that stage had been more interested in good legislation than railroading the Parliament, we could have fixed it then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that the Opposition's objections to this procedure, that automatically joins people in a particular class into an action without some conscious act of consent, stands. We do not believe in a system that says your rights can be determined without your knowledge in the event that you have failed to take steps to have yourself taken out of the action. We believe that your rights ought to be determined only when you choose to have them determined, either by taking your own action, or indeed by opting into a representative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that the Government has taken the conceptually wrong position, which has now led to complications&mdash;and indeed has led to the problems that we are now seeking to amend&mdash;we will support this amendment. It makes a little less worse a very bad system. I do want to raise, however, something that we will be moving by way of an amendment in due course. It is a point that I raised when this Bill came in in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to take a class action and join in all members of a class, in the event that they do not consciously take themselves out, and if, as a result of that, the action loses&mdash;none of the members of the class are liable for costs&mdash;there will be an obvious incentive to put up an impecunious representative party. Why would you not?  If the representative proceeding fails and it is only the representative party, the named party, that can be liable for costs, why not have an impecunious person?  The defendant in those circumstances will not be able to recover costs. It does not matter that they get an order for costs; they will not be able to recover costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this raises the possibility of greenmail, where a class action can be started in the name of an impecunious plaintiff and the defendant knows that even if it wins, at the end of the day it has an order for costs which will be barren against an impecunious representative party. The obvious commercial decision of those defendants will be, `We will spend some of the money we would obviously have to spend defending our position in buying off the representative party, or indeed the class, and come out, not vindicated by the court, but at least less financially worse off'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will move amendment No. 5 of the amendments that have been circulated in my name directed at covering potential abuses of the system. It gives the court a discretion to award costs against persons on whose behalf a proceeding has been commenced, if there are exceptional circumstances for so doing. We do not define `exceptional circumstances', but the circumstance we seek to cover is where there are members of a class who have assets or who indeed may have decided the action should be taken, but the person against whom the order for costs can be made is an impecunious plaintiff or representative party or named party, and those people can effectively shield behind that impecunious person. In those circumstances, if evidence is forthcoming to the court, the court should have the power nonetheless to make an order for costs which has some chance of being fulfilled. Justice demands it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to insert new sections into the Federal Court of Australia requiring registrars and deputy registrars to take an oath or affirmation of office before the Chief Judge of the Federal Court or a judge of the Federal Court before commencing duty. This is very interesting. When it came to prescribing the oath that the registrars would take, a form of oath was set out in the legislation, what is commonly called an oath of office, that the person would discharge his or her duties and would discharge them in accordance with their requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I managed to compare it with the oath that is required of the judges themselves. The oath that is required of the judges themselves, of course, is rather different. It is not just an oath of office; it is also an oath of allegiance that the judicial officer will bear true allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors according to law. It is a common form of oath. It is taken by members of parliament. It is taken by judges. It is taken by members of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is taken by the registrar of the Industrial Relations Commission, and when there was a recent amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act, it was provided that it would be taken by the registrar of that court. Mysteriously, the oath prescribed for registrars of the Federal and Family courts does not follow that form and does not provide for that oath of allegiance to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the Government thinks&mdash;and we see Ministers who like to fly off to Asian capitals and cast aspersions on the heirs to the throne&mdash;the fact is that in this country, the Queen is the head of the constitutional monarchy and until that is lawfully changed, as in a citizenship oath, oaths of loyalty are taken in that prescribed form. There is no reason why the oath should not be the same for registrars in the Federal and Family courts as indeed it is for the judges. We will move amendments to ensure that there is that common form and to ensure that it is the same common form as applies to other registrars and indeed in other commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act is one of the real doozies of this Government. It was one of those Acts that sort of started and never seemed to have an end. It was one of those Acts that even confused the Government. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) will say that is not difficult. We just saw a Minister in here who did not bring down the pages of one of his speeches and could not finish the speech. The people of Australia probably think that Ministers know what they are doing. It is very instructive to see what actually happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Act illustrates indeed one of the great legislative failures of this Government. When it finally got to the Senate, the Opposition moved 50 amendments and the Government accepted 10. The Government moved 40 of its own, and that was in December of 1990. When it was due to come into effect by September of 1991, the Government rushed down here to delay its coming into effect&mdash;this was some eight months after it had finally passed the Bill with some 50 amendments&mdash;and it put further amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had 10 of our amendments and 40 of the Government's amendments in 1990. By 1991 we had a whole new raft of amendments and, lo and behold, what are we doing now in 1992? Good heavens, we have discovered that there is a need for some more amendments to the Privacy Act. I do not think there is anything left of the original Act. I think that the tapestry of amendments has now been sewn together into an Act of an entirely different quality. The one thing that can be said for the Government, I suppose, is that it really must keep the parliamentary draftsman busy as it considers and reconsiders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know what? I think we will be back here next year amending this very same Act. In fact, I think this Parliament could probably go for 10 years amending the Privacy Act, bit by bit, piece by piece, in order to finally get it wrong. Sooner or later, you really have to get legislation right. Presumably we do not exist in this Parliament year after year to amend our own incompetent work. Presumably, one day this Privacy Act is going to be settled and is actually going to be a piece of legislation that has a clear start and a clear end, is carefully thought out and actually works, and works well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are quite a few changes as a result of these amendments, and I will review some of them briefly. The bulk of the amendments make further provision for securitisation schemes. They deem organisations involved in securitisation arrangements to be credit providers while they are performing tasks for the purposes of those arrangements. The consequence of deeming trustees and trust managers involved in securitisation arrangements to be credit providers is that they will be able to obtain access to credit reports from credit reporting agencies in their own right for the purpose of assessing a risk involved in purchasing loans by means of the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, credit enhancers will be able to obtain access to credit reports for the purposes of assessing the risk of undertaking credit enhancement of the loan. These amendments will facilitate the growth and operations of the securitisation industry and are welcomed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a widening of the provisions as regards disclosure of information to guarantors. I refer to proposed new paragraph 18N(1)(bg). Honourable members should just mull that around in their minds. That will give them an idea as to how simple and well thought out this legislation is! By the way, laymen are supposed to understand this kind of thing. People are supposed to be able to read these laws and know what the Parliament has asked them to do. But, by the time this Government has mishmashed the whole of its legislative policy, one would have to be much brighter than the Minister who lost his speech tonight to understand what it actually means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new paragraph 18N(1)(bg) will permit credit providers to disclose to guarantors credit information relating to a borrower where the borrower has consented to the disclosure of the information. The provision will apply to guarantees entered into after the commencement of the amendments. In respect of guarantees entered into before the commencement of the amendments, the borrower's consent will not be required, but the information that may be disclosed will be limited to information relevant to the amount or possible amount of the person's liability under the contract of guarantee. These amendments will assist guarantors to find out relevant information about the persons that they are guaranteeing, and we will support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say again that when the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act came forward we said that they were flawed. Indeed, we introduced an alternative Bill which was much more straightforward than the current Bill with all of its amendments. It was a Bill that was overwhelmingly supported by the business and users community of this country and would have avoided many of these problems. The problem is that, when we start out with a Bill that has a flawed logic to it, we get into all of these sorts of complications as we try to pick up the unintended consequences of all sorts of things that should never have been tried in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments will permit the disclosure of information concerning an account such as the account balance, the amount of available credit on the account and minimum payments due to a person who is authorised to operate the account. So we are talking there about joint account holders such as the husband and wife situation where the husband or the wife may have the account in his or her name but another person is authorised to operate it. That other person will now be allowed to get information concerning the account such as the account balance and available credit so that he or she will be able to know the position of the account when coming to operate it. Obviously, there is a good policy in that. Overall, in a flawed situation with a dreadful track record of legislative amendment, the best that can be said for this Bill is that it improves a bad situation, and it will have our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow the amendments that have been circulated in my name. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 will correct the error in the current amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, and I thank the Government for accepting them. Amendments Nos 3 and 4 will prescribe a uniform oath for registrars in the Federal Court and the Family Court in the same form as that for the judges and, as I said before, for other registrars in Commonwealth judicial positions. Amendment No. 5, as I said before, will deal with the situation in relation to the class actions or representative proceedings to allow the facility in exceptional circumstances for judges to make orders for costs that are necessary in the interests of justice and to avoid what otherwise could amount to manifest injustice. I commend to the Government not only foreshadowed amendments Nos 1 and 2 but also amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) at his most indignant best in this debate on the Law and Justice Amendment Bill (No. 4). He came into the House and assailed us with his best private school manner about the faults which are manifest by the need for this very legislation. The first five minutes or so of his contribution was his strident attack against sloppy draftsmanship in various Acts which the Parliament has considered, the need to subsequently amend them, and the  contribution to this by the use of the guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some aspects I agree with the honourable member. It is obviously not desirable that important legislation should have time limits on the process of its debate. But the indignation is a little hollow. The guillotine is a device which has been used by both sides of parliament and, of course, has a very colourful history indeed. But it is hardly valid to claim that this Government has invented the device or is the only government using it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe we have perfected it at all, but it has been used. I do not believe it is the primary role of this Parliament&mdash;although it is a role&mdash;to be going through, clause by clause, and picking on particular drafting aspects of legislation. I would have thought the Parliament has a role a bit beyond that in terms of debate about policy considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member went on and cited a long-winded section of the Privacy Act, saying, `18N(1)(bg)&mdash;this is incredible. It is hardly plain English drafting. How can the ordinary person hope to understand it?'. I have some sympathy with that view. In fact, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into plain English drafting. I just find it a little hypocritical that this honourable member from the Victorian Liberal Party comes in here and says that plain English drafting is what we need, and that this is a bad example, when his colleagues in Victoria have just abolished the Victorian Law Reform Commission which, I think, is the pre-eminent body that Australia has had in recent years arguing the case for plain English drafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Victoria the body which, Australia-wide, has been championing the cause so that we do not get the gobbledegook sections, but have laws written in simple English that ordinary people can understand. What do the Victorian colleagues in the Party which the honourable member for Higgins represents do? They abolish the very body that has been championing the cause of plain English drafting. I do not know what that means in Victoria, but in Queensland it smacks just a little of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the honourable member for Higgins, as he is now a strong convert to, and advocate of, law which ordinary Australians can understand, should have a word with his recently elected colleagues in Victoria. He should suggest that the axing of the Law Reform Commission may be a somewhat short-sighted measure; that it is not going to save us money in the long run; and if we can get simpler laws which people can understand that will be an enormous cost saving for this country. Abolishing the Law Reform Commission to save a million and a half dollars is a rather short-sighted measure, when that Commission has estimated that at least $100m a year can be saved if we adopt a genuine process of plain English drafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins went on in his indignant manner to raise particular matters in this Bill. One point that he went on about was the amendments to the Federal Court Act regarding representative actions. He suggested that, again, the Government had got it wrong in its drafting by not having provisions which adequately covered the awarding of costs against persons added to a class in a representative action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is fair to say that that is some sort of drafting mistake on the part of the Government. I think the situation at that stage was that the Government was relying on well-established precedents of many superior court decisions about the awarding of damages in representative actions. It was the understanding of the operation of the law at the time which led to the provisions being drafted in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an insult to the Commonwealth draftsman that he did not know the law and that it was a simple drafting mistake. It was not a drafting mistake. Subsequent to the passing of the Act, there have been decisions both in Victoria and in the High Court which have thrown doubt on these issues and have resulted in the need for the amendment. To say that that amendment was the result of sloppy drafting is a gross misrepresentation. It is an amendment resulting from a High Court decision and a Victorian Supreme Court decision which changed what was understood, at the time the Act was passed, about the provision of awarding costs in these circumstances. As a result of those court decisions the law is being changed. It has nothing to do whatsoever with the provision of drafting. I take issue with the honourable member on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the amendments are of a minor nature. It may well be that in the first place some of the amendments were caused by sloppy drafting. I am not going to pretend that mistakes are not made. Unlike the honourable member for Higgins, some people are actually human and do make mistakes from time to time. Most of the amendments are necessitated by changing circumstances and the need to keep legislation up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the honourable member go on at some length about the Privacy Act. It was a very important piece of legislation. It was a new Act which covered areas which had previously not been regulated in Australia. Obviously, the Act has been subject to changes over time as the provisions have worked their way through in practice. I do not believe it is unreasonable to expect the Government to respond to problems as they arise and amend the law accordingly. Given that time allowed for this debate is short, I will leave it at that. I hope the honourable member for Higgins will carry through on his strong support of plain English drafting and bemoan, as I do, the axing of the Victorian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening on behalf of the Opposition to debate the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 1992 and three other cognate Bills that are before the House. The Opposition supports the principle behind the Bills which is that seafarers should have a rehabilitation and compensation system in keeping with contemporary community standards. Not only does the Opposition agree with that principle, but the industry itself concurs with that view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it is important to note that the Opposition does not agree with every single aspect of the legislation. We will be drawing attention to some of those areas of difference and concern that we have during this debate here tonight and also later on in the other place where the possibility of having a lengthier debate on the subject is available to members of the Senate. That, unfortunately, is not available to members of the House of Representatives because this evening we are subject to the guillotine which limits debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act that the legislation is intended to replace&mdash;the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911&mdash;is clearly out of date. I think everybody agrees with that. This was certainly acknowledged by the review of seamen's compensation which was conducted by Professor Harold Luntz who, incidentally, was the architect of the WorkCare scheme in Victoria. Honourable members from Victoria would be well aware of that scheme and indeed would have had some considerable concerns about it in the past. However, Professor Luntz recommended in his review that compensation arrangements should be on the basis of community standards and Cabinet determined that this would be the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, commonly referred to as the CERC Act. The selection of the CERC Act was not necessarily that of the review report, as suggested in the Government's explanatory memorandum, but indeed it was the Government's own selection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be observed, however, that the CERC Act relates to Commonwealth public servants and some employees of government statutory authorities and government-owned business enterprises, but does not relate to private enterprise. The proposed legislation relates only to private enterprise and does not cover public servants. Under these circumstances, it is not clear on what basis the communality has been determined, other than the fact that they are both Federal Acts and the only Federal Acts so far dealing with rehabilitation and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are major differences, not the least being that the Navigation Act already provides for a three-month sick leave period, regardless of length of service, due to specific maritime requirements such as the need for complete recovery and fitness clearance to work on ships, especially for seafarers such as engineers, et cetera, where the physical demands are specific. It is interesting to note that in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), when introducing these Bills into the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of benefits payable to partially incapacitated employees who are able to work will be on a graduated scale. For these persons the combined total of compensation plus earnings will be between 75 per cent and 100 per cent of normal weekly earnings, depending on the number of hours that the employee actually works.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting statement by the Parliamentary Secretary because, as everybody in the maritime industry would understand, one cannot be at sea unless one is 100 per cent fit. Seafarers, because of the nature of the work, cannot afford to be 75 per cent, 90 per cent or 95 per cent fit; they must be 100 per cent fit. They all have to be capable of going up and down ladders, squeezing in and out of confined spaces and being able to lift and carry things in the performance of their duties and at the same time manage to maintain their feet in what can only be described from time to time as very difficult circumstances. It is important for us to remember in the course of discussing these types of Bills&mdash;as I think the Parliamentary Secretary has probably mistakenly said in his speech&mdash;that we cannot have somebody at sea or pretend to be able to get people back at sea and pay them partial benefits unless they are 100 per cent fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the CERC Act is subject to a review currently under way. This will most likely lead to revisions in the level of and approach to benefits. It is not clear how the results of such a review will affect the provisions of this particular Bill. It is interesting to note that this Bill basically ties the compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers to the CERC Act itself. Whilst this is being done, the CERC Act is currently under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that it would have been more logical to delay the implementation of this Bill until the CERC Act completed its review and the recommendations that would no doubt flow from that review could have been undertaken in coalition with the introduction of this legislation tonight. We do not want to find in a few months time that the Parliament is back debating the amendments necessary to this Bill because of the review of the CERC Act. It would seem to be an undue waste of the Parliament's time and cost to the taxpayer to have amendments brought back into the House because we decided to bring a Bill into the House that tied itself to a system that was currently under review and we had to review the legislation that we have before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has argued that existing Federal standards are the only ones appropriate for an industry that is not fixed in any one State. We all realise that the maritime industry&mdash;the shipping industry in Australia&mdash;requires its employees to be all over the place, be it from State to State, from international boundary to international boundary, in the course of carrying out their employment. Because of that, the Commonwealth argues that there is a need for the CERC Act to apply and that the Commonwealth should fix the terms and conditions of compensation and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the Commonwealth argues that we need to have one set of standards established by the Commonwealth that overrides all the State boundaries and State differences. This is not borne out by arrangements, for example, in the aviation industry, where aircrews are also habitually mobile outside their home jurisdictions for extended periods. For instance, Ansett aircrews are covered by home port jurisdiction, despite the fact that they may be out of jurisdiction for extended periods and may be out of State jurisdictions of any sort, for example, to Cocos and Christmas Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little apparent rationale for the choice of the CERC Act as the community standard other than possibly that it represents the penthouse level rather than the basement level in compensation. Similarly, it is not clear why it has not been possible to close off altogether liability of employers under common law. One of the attractions of the arrangements in the first place is that they introduce certainty into compensation and make the trauma and costliness of common law action unnecessary. It would seem to be desirable to close off altogether that trauma and costliness. In common law actions settlements are delayed, often to the detriment of the claimant, and costs escalate to the detriment of both claimant and employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill limits common law action to death and permanent injury for non-economic loss, for permanent injury it is capped, but it remains open in the case of death. The industry would prefer that there be no recourse to common law and that the Bill be comprehensive in application. The Opposition has sympathy with this view and would like to pursue the issue further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other aspects that seem to be anomalous. Although the Bill exempts self-inflicted injury from the employer's liability, the more serious case of suicide is not exempted. There is no clear reason why the employer should not be held liable for the lesser instance but be held responsible for the greater. Suicide is an event against which the employer cannot insure and over which he cannot exert any control or take preventive measures; therefore, employer liability seems out of place. Section 26(1) of the legislation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an employee suffers an injury that results in his or her death, incapacity for work, or impairment, compensation is payable for the injury.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 26(2) and section 26(3) of the Act qualify that provision. Section 26(2) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . which provides that compensation is not payable for an intentionally self-inflicted injury.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 26(3) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . which provides that compensation is not payable for an injury that is not intentionally self-inflicted but is caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employee, unless the injury results in death, or serious and permanent impairment.</PARA>
<PARA>The industry has expressed its objections to the Opposition to the exclusion of death or permanent impairment from subsection (3), given the principle of non-liability on the part of the employer for the lesser event of injury. It seems contradictory for the Bill to accept that the employer cannot be held responsible for an employee's injuries resulting from his or her own wilful misconduct but then to hold the employer responsible for an employee's permanent impairment or death under the same circumstances. It seems that logic fails us in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of employer abuse of such an exclusion in order to evade major claims by charging wilful misconduct is guarded against by the dispute settlement and appeal provisions. If the reasoning is that it is the employee's widow and children who are punished by the misconduct rather than the employee, that may present a case for some other measure such as employee insurance. But it is not satisfactory to make the employer liable for something that is obviously not his fault and which he would not have condoned&mdash;and, indeed, nobody would have condoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the above have been justified in representations to the Opposition on the grounds that they are compatible with the CERC Act. Apart from doubts about the appropriateness of using the CERC Act as the community standard in the first place, the Opposition questions the need to perpetuate whatever shortcomings the Act may have simply in the name of consistency&mdash;the more so as the CERC Act itself is under review and subject to change in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further shortcoming that the industry has drawn to the attention of the Opposition is in clause 97, which stipulates that the employers' fund&mdash;that is, the safety net run by employers to cover employees on industry training courses and those on a roster or in transit from a ship or a place of training&mdash;should insure for a liability in excess of $1m for a catastrophe or an event which results in several expensive claims arising from a single accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause was inserted by the Government at the last moment&mdash;and, the industry claims, without proper consultation with the employers' compensation agency. It cuts across the exercise of commercial judgment by the fund's administrators and is at odds with the principle of industry and employer responsibility reflected elsewhere in the Bill. In the Opposition's view, the reserve powers to assume responsibility for safety net provisions are sufficient to safeguard the responsible commercial operation of the fund, and full commercial responsibility should lie with the employers and the industry until the Minister's reserve powers under the Bill become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill presents a laudable principle and noble motives that show some signs of arbitrary dealings. The Cabinet decision has been defended to the Opposition only in terms of `Well, that's what the Cabinet decided'. Explanations for the decision to adopt the CERC Act as the so-called community standard envisaged in the Luntz Review are needed. There are loose ends, including some that have been hastily added at the last moment. Quite why the Bill is being pushed through with so little opportunity for examination or debate&mdash;it was introduced in the House only on 14 October&mdash;is not clear. Seafarers have, after all, managed since 1911, and it would be advisable to get this much needed modernisation of their compensation arrangements right. The Opposition supports the principle and intention of this Bill but wants to clarify some of these outstanding matters during its passage through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the point that this is the first instance that we are able to find where the Government has imposed compensation and rehabilitation requirements that it uses for itself upon the private sector. It is interesting to note that, in its reforms of the shipping and waterfront industries, one of the things that the Government has tried to achieve is to focus the attention of employees and employers of people in the maritime industry onto the individual enterprise rather than to treat themselves as being part of a broad industry which has common pay rates, common terms and conditions of employment, and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this legislation does is impose terms and conditions of employment&mdash;in this instance, relating to compensation and rehabilitation&mdash;upon the private sector that currently are applied only to Commonwealth Government public servants. We would like to know why that is the case. We would like to ensure that, in the process of providing these generous rehabilitation and compensation terms for seafarers, other industries and other unions do not seek to try to follow up the sorts of gains that the seafaring industry has had and that we do not see this type of benefit flow through to other sectors of industry right throughout the economy. We have seen instances of this occur in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the debate in the last week or two in Victoria has focused on the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading. It is worth remembering that the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading was brought in by the Whitlam Government; I think Clyde Cameron was the Minister for Labour at the time. That was brought in to benefit a particular sector of the Australian work force to overcome a particular problem that that sector had with employees going on leave and, as a result, suffering a loss of income. No sooner was that particular benefit provided to that particular section of the Australian work force than every other sector turned around and said, `Well, goodness, they've got it; why can't we?', and they all followed on and adopted the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading through various means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leave loading, of course, was not originally intended for those particular sectors of the Australian work force that picked it up later on. We have seen the costs of that grow to quite high levels&mdash;indeed, levels that the Minister responsible for its introduction admitted in later years he was alarmed by. So let us not see this legislation lead to other industries and other work forces trying to adopt the more generous provisions that are in this Act as a result of the Commonwealth applying terms and conditions of employment that are applicable at present only to the employee seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, I repeat that the Opposition supports the principal intent of this legislation. We agree that there is a need to improve this particular aspect of the terms and conditions of employment for seafarers. We recognise that the current Act is inadequate and long overdue for review. However, we argue that there is a need for particular aspects of the legislation to be corrected. We look forward to seeing that occur, either through the Government's own initiation or, indeed, at some stage later when it is debated in the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this important cognate debate on seafarers legislation, which essentially is a complete overhaul of seamen's compensation. I was also pleased to hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) indicate that the Opposition supports these Bills which we are debating this evening. I was interested in what he said about the likely flow-on. As seamen have waited since 1911 for their Act to be brought up to modern day accepted standards, I think that the benefits they are getting are generally accepted out there in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another small, niggly point. The honourable member referred to aircrews and how they are often bound by State jurisdictions. He pointed to Cocos and Christmas Islands. As the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, well knows, having introduced the legislation, Cocos and Christmas Islands now come under Western Australian jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 has not been significantly amended since it was first enacted. As a consequence, the Act does not reflect the modern rehabilitation, compensation and social concepts which have been progressively introduced since the early 1970s into the workers compensation scheme for Commonwealth employees and into State schemes. Prior to the substantial review of the Commonwealth employees workers compensation scheme in 1971, there had been a close nexus between the seafarers and the Commonwealth employees scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been indicated, this is the first major reform since the Act was introduced in 1911. I do not know why, but it seems that the Act missed out on the two waves of reforms of shipping legislation which were implemented in Australia during the conservative legislation period in the 1970s and early 1980s. I do not like to say it, but it appears to me that the conservatives were not much interested in seamen's conditions. Reform was ignored. I guess this was because it was a small area and nobody paid it much attention. The attitude was: why should we do anything for the seamen? The conservative Government did not regard seamen as important enough to implement legislation to reform the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the then Minister for Social Security commissioned Professor Harold Luntz to conduct a review of seamen's compensation. This review was part of the reform of the shipping industry and, as part of that process, the Luntz inquiry went ahead. The inquiry first produced a discussion paper and then a report designed to bring the legislation up to date with generally accepted community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following extensive consultation with industry parties, the Government agreed to the development of the new workers' compensation legislation for seafarers. I make the point that there had been 1 1/2 years of consultation before the final report by the Luntz inquiry. A Cabinet decision was taken in June 1991 to authorise the Department to draft legislation to be brought before the House. That process involved consultation with employer bodies and unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An undertaking was given by shipowners to the Ship Industry Reform Authority that they would support reform of the compensation regime in order to complement the other reforms that had been taking place in the shipping industry during the last seven or eight years. These reforms have seen a reduction in the manning levels on ships from 35 in the early 1980s to average levels today of 21 for existing ships and 18 for new ships. I make the point, which is not very often made in this House, that all this has been achieved without any significant disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that few industries in Australia have successfully undertaken more dramatic change than the seagoing industry. This dramatic change has involved retraining, multiskilling and a reduction in the number of unions. But to listen to the conservatives in this House, one would think that nothing had happened in relation to the seagoing unions. I suggest that the conservatives are out of touch with what has happened in relation to the seagoing unions, as they are out of touch with the reforms that have been carried out on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The momentum of change in the industry will continue. Earlier this year the industry established the Seafarers Assistance Service. Following negotiations between unions and employers, the Seafarers Assistance Service was established to provide a professional counselling service to deal with a whole range of problems that can be faced by workers, including drug and alcohol problems, marital problems and other stresses, all of which can lead to difficulties in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Seafarers Assistance Service is funded by shipping employees and represents the first such national industry-wide scheme anywhere in the world. A recent ILO conference in Geneva congratulated Australia and the Australian industry on this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government has already taken steps towards the adoption of occupational health and safety legislation for the maritime industry. The maritime industry is one of the few industries in Australia which does not currently have comprehensive health and safety legislation. When this compensation reform and occupational health and safety legislation are enacted, the Government and industry will have put in place a comprehensive regime to reduce occupational injuries and diseases that will be of lasting benefit to seafarers and the Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore seemed to be saying, `Why go ahead with this at this time when other matters have not been fully worked out?'. I might make a point about this desire for delay with this legislation. There has been no delay to the reform process in the shipping industry and there is no reason why the reform process of compensation should be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore also made points about the differences in the CERC Act. While the benefits provided in the Bill are identical to those available in the CERC Act, there are a number of areas where it has been necessary to finetune the arrangements to reflect the differences between private and public sector employment. There is a significant range of differences between the two schemes, not least the superannuation schemes, rehabilitation, time limits for determination, curtailing of common law action in respect of industries occurring before the commencement day and provision of application of certain retired employees. There is a whole range of finetuning that is very necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this reform. I very much welcome the fact that at last this Act is being brought up to date to reflect modern standards and modern conditions in the seagoing union. I have great respect for those who go to sea around the Australian coast. I think they are unsung and underpraised people. I am always thankful when I look at some of the conditions on Australian shipping that we do not have the same sorts of conditions that exist in some other countries' shipping that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and I have been investigating over the last 12 or 18 months and will be reporting to the Parliament about shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this Bill will create a progressive compensation and rehabilitation system comparable to other modern workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The measures will ensure that injured seafarers are quickly and effectively rehabilitated. This in turn will cut the time lost through work related injuries and the associated compensation costs and human suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform represents another step in the Government's comprehensive shipping reform program which has resulted in significantly increasing Australian shipping competitiveness, including a 50 per cent reduction in crew sizes on modern, technologically advanced ships. I have great pleasure in commending these Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the at least partial support of the Opposition for this legislation, although I have to say that I do not have a great deal of confidence in what the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) was saying. In his concluding remarks he said that the Opposition does agree on the need to improve the legislation and that it ought to be corrected, but not now. Not 81 years after the original Act? Will we wait until the twenty-first century?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that the nexus between Commonwealth employees and entitlements for seafarers was broken 21 years ago by the Opposition. There was a nexus. The States usually have a nexus in their compensation schemes with their own State employees. It is not new, it is not novel, it is not inequitable&mdash;it is sensible. Twenty-one years after, the then coalition broke the nexus on the basis that they should wait until the Woodhouse report came down. The Woodhouse report came down. Those opposite were in government for another seven years, from 1975 to 1983. They were still waiting and here we are again tonight. Yet the honourable member for Gilmore says that we should wait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underneath this is a long-lasting antipathy on the part of the Liberal and National parties towards the Australian shipping industry. There is a grudging sort of recognition that tremendous progress has been made, and there is a willingness in that industry to try to become competitive in selected areas as a major service industry. But, no, they give grudging recognition but they cannot forget whatever it was that caused that animosity. I have not been able to discover it, but I can see it. It is there day after day. That grudging recognition has been expressed here tonight. Those opposite say, `Well, it is a good thing. We ought to do something about it, but not now'. Not now&mdash;which, as I said, is 81 years after this Act was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be few pieces of legislation in this Parliament that date back to 1911. The honourable member for Gilmore says, `Leave it until a bit later. We will look at it in the other place'. We know what will happen in the other place. I will tell honourable members now. We will have the Liberal and National parties in the other place endeavouring to say, `Look, this needs to be held back because the CERC Act is being changed. We have to hold it back until then. We will see what amendments are made to that'. We are now into November. The House adjourns in a matter of weeks. We will come back in February some time. There could be an election. Honourable members opposite will not get in, but the whole thing will be put off for at least another half year or a year. In the meantime, seafarers' families will be seriously disadvantaged. That is the inequity of the existing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are not being pushed through; it is a just recognition of seafarers' entitlements and the needs of their families. After all, seafarers do have families: they marry, they have children, they have brothers and sisters, and they also have parents. They do have family needs, and this recognition is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to be quite scornful of the words of the honourable member for Gilmore: `We support it in principle. There are some aspects of it which I will come to in a moment, but not now'. He raised the question of suicide and said that a person who committed suicide should not be entitled to benefits. But the provisions relating to serious and wilful misconduct and self-inflicted injuries are identical to the provisions in the CERC Act. The question of whether suicide was compensable was considered in relation to the CERC Act in the case of Innes v. Commonwealth in 1979. The reference is ICCD 129. Essentially, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal found, first, that there was sufficient evidence for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the deceased's employment was a contributing factor. I repeat: his employment was a contributing factor to the development of the mental disease which led to his suicide; and, secondly, the deceased's mind was so unhinged as to dethrone his power of volition, and the claim was not barred by the subsection. It would appear that a claim in relation to suicide would be granted only where these conditions were satisfied. So I think we can dismiss that comment from the Opposition fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment that the honourable member for Gilmore made was in respect of common law claims. The provision covering common law actions by employees against an employer or fellow employee is again identical to the provision in the CERC Act. I am amazed that the Opposition should raise this point. In developing the CERC Bill, the Government's intention was that the Commonwealth employee should have no recourse to common law actions against the Commonwealth or fellow employees. However, that Bill was amended in the Senate by the Opposition and the Democrats to allow capped common law actions for non-economic loss such as permanent impairment and pain and suffering. In the common law actions relating to death, no Australian jurisdiction, except the Northern Territory, restricts access to common law in respect of dependants of a deceased worker. In any case, the Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to limit common law actions by the dependants of deceased seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question concerned the level of benefits. For heaven's sake, how long are seafarers' families to be denied fair recognition of their entitlements in comparison to the families of other employees? I said earlier that prior to 1971, prior to the coalition parties breaking the nexus with Commonwealth employees, there was recognition; there was a relationship. The review of the Comcare scheme carried out by Mr Ron Brown recommended that the general levels of benefit provision under the Comcare scheme should be maintained. Most of that review related to the administration of Comcare. It had nothing to do with the seafarer scheme. Many of the review's recommendations have been implemented through the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992 and the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other recommendations under consideration by Comcare, but they do not have any relevance to the seafarer scheme. Should it be decided in the future that benefits under the Commonwealth employees legislation should be changed, the Government could also examine the need to change the seafarer scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we have put aside the point raised by the honourable member for Gilmore. I repeat that I listened to his remarks intently. Even though these recommendations have come forward from the industry, there was long consultation between the industry, the unions and government about this legislation. There was ample opportunity for all of these points to come forward. At this time the honourable member for Gilmore, on behalf of the Opposition, is looking for some reason to justify delaying or not passing this legislation or to block the legislation in the other place because of that antipathy I mentioned earlier that the Opposition has towards Australian seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of this nation, my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Gilmore, should have a rethink and set about recognising the Australian shipping industry as a major service sector in our economy. On a tonne/kilometre basis, we are the fifth largest shipping market in the world. If we pick out niche markets in the global market, we can expand trade, earn foreign income and save this country freight. Over time, there is a major opportunity for the Australian shipping industry to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the honourable member for Gilmore to start going down that track and not look every time for a reason to hold back Australian industry. There is always an argument that those on the other side can develop to say, `It is not too bad. There is a bit of an improvement, but we really ought to be doing a lot more'. It is like the Opposition's attitude to the trans-Tasman services. For instance, the Opposition says that the trans-Tasman accord is not satisfactory and should be abolished. But the people who use the trans-Tasman services have an ongoing opportunity to initiate legal action and have whatever service they want across the Tasman. The people who use the service appreciate the frequency of it. They want the 12 ports in New Zealand serviced on a regular basis. They have ample capacity to move in an east-west direction when they want to. They have had a 20 per cent reduction in real terms in rates over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are quite happy with what they have got, but here in this place the Opposition says that it is not right and should be changed. Again, this simply indicates that those opposite are out of touch with and lack an understanding of what business needs. They can pontificate or sound off about it, but the people who have an opportunity to do something about it any time they wish&mdash;the users of those services&mdash;have not done so. They have been invited to do it by the New Zealand Government, but they have not taken up the offer because they want to retain the kind of service they have with its level of viability and rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Gilmore asking why this legislation is being pushed through. He said, `After all, the existing legislation has operated since 1911'. That is terrific. How about we apply that approach to parliamentary salaries&mdash;parliamentary salaries set in 1911? The legislation is there. Why should we change it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit hard? It would be a reasonable proposition along the lines of that coming from those opposite, but they would not say that. It is like the Opposition's other proposal in respect of industrial relations, but I would be outside the realm of the debate so I had better withdraw from discussing that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gilmore referred to the benefits as being the penthouse level rather than the basement level of pay arrangements. What is wrong with Australian seafarers? Are they not Australians? Were they not born in this nation? Do they not go to our schools and training colleges? Do they not rise to be captains and recognised across the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian maritime credentials in the world are top class; anybody who has trained in Australia has good credentials. The reason there are so many Australian seafarers working in Asia is that the tasks are complex and competent and reliable people are wanted. But no, the Opposition says that we should be looking at basement levels and not these penthouse levels of payment. I will come to the level of payments as I work through my notes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Opposition suggesting that we should treat seafarers as second-class citizens? Of course it is, and it should come clean about it. We all recognise that it is. It is saying that an injury to a seafarer should be worth less than an injury to a public sector employee. Neither the State schemes nor the Northern Territory scheme differentiate between the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion by the Opposition also ignores the historical nexus between Commonwealth employees and seafarer schemes. As I said earlier, that nexus was broken by a previous conservative government while waiting for the Woodhouse committee report. When it came into government, it abandoned the concept of a national scheme and abandoned the seafarers as well, leaving them with the oldest workers compensation legislation on the Australian statute book. Why? Because of this antipathy of the Liberal-National parties to Australian seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that my dear colleagues opposite woke up and recognised that seafaring is an important industry in this country and can be a much more important industry. It can make a major contribution to our invisible earnings, the growth of this country and the generation of jobs. It is not something to be hated and despised. How long has this industry remained in this condition? Decade after decade; it is 21 years alone in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that the seafarers scheme should be based on State legislation is ludicrous. There is a tremendous variation between the States. In fact, a number of the State benefits are higher than what is proposed in this legislation. The benefits under this Bill are broadly comparable with those provided under the most popular States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The other States which have lower benefits have open access to common law for economic and non-economic loss. The Northern Territory is the only jurisdiction that has totally abrogated common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A successful damages action has the potential to cost far more than the prescribed benefits under the no fault scheme benefits, plus the substantial legal costs. I took the remarks of my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Gilmore, in respect of rehabilitation to mean that it is something to be scorned, something that really was not desirable in the scheme of things for seafarers. Let me say to the honourable member opposite: the establishment of Comcare and the emphasis and requirement that there be a rehabilitation program where unfitness for work extends beyond 28 days has resulted in a halving of the number of claims for compensation for periods beyond 28 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work related illness and injury in this country cost some $10,000m each year. In an area where it is extremely important to try to avoid work related illness and injury and so minimise cost&mdash;and that is the benefit that can come from this legislation&mdash;rehabilitation is an important part. That $10,000m cost in work related illness and injury is something that has to be addressed by us all. The most effective way of addressing it is through the rehabilitation programs and dispensing with the idea that one can go on compensation and carry on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the fact that a rehabilitation program has to be initiated by the employer after 28 days has altered the expectations of both employers and employees. Many of us know of cases in the private and public sectors where people have been a little iffy and do not work as well as one would like to see them work. Their cases in terms of compensation might be a bit marginal, but the employer in the private sector supports their applications for compensation to get them off the payroll. Who pays? The insurance company. Who pays the insurance company? All businesses in this country. So that $10,000m cost per annum is a heavy burden upon this nation, upon our economy and upon our becoming more competitive in domestic and international economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are bringing rehabilitation into this industry for the first time. It will ensure that vocational training is available for those who are no longer able to continue in the industry. So we have here an opportunity for people who cannot go back into the industry. The honourable member for Gilmore said that one has to be 100 per cent fit to be on a ship. Many people are hurt on ships. I will give a few examples&mdash;and these are the ships that the honourable for Gilmore supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Burmese seaman lost two fingers through sloppy practices and working in an untrained manner when moving a hawser and lifting a hatch cover. He received compensation here and was rushed home quicker than he should have been. He should have been kept in hospital until the stubs of his fingers were fully healed, but he was rushed back to Bangkok. When he got back to Burma, his compensation and wages were confiscated and he had lost two fingers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the kinds of ships and practices that the Opposition supports. It wants open slather in this country for foreign ships. I can tell my friends opposite that they will get to carry the can for the practices and the exploitations of people that are going on. In this legislation we are introducing for Australian seafarers what everybody else in industry should have&mdash;proper processes for rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had legislation for seafarers since 1911, as I mentioned earlier. What we are moving to, for the first time, with this rehabilitation is reducing the cost of the long term injury, because currently there are no rehabilitation arrangements. If we can get people back to work quicker, and have them submitting fewer compensation claims, then the cost of the scheme will go down. There is an in-built opportunity here for employers with proper practices, good training and proper rehabilitation programs to reduce the cost of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shipping sector is the only area of employment in Australia where unfettered, unlimited common law rights still exist for workers. The temptation of large lump sum pay-outs has led to many long, drawn out common law damages claims. Who are the beneficiaries? On occasions, the seafarers' families, but the guaranteed beneficiaries are the lawyers and the doctors. They win every time. They are on a no loss claim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, except for that bit, where some self-interest in here evoked some response. I make the point that the honourable member for Shortland&mdash;whose interest in these matters is considerable and whose expertise is recognised not only by myself but also by others&mdash;started out with a great deal of nonsense. The sorts of comments he made&mdash;that the Opposition hates seafarers, that we have an antipathy toward them and so forth&mdash;are, as is so often the case with some of the things that the honourable member for Shortland says, evidence that he is living in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well and truly on the record&mdash;and I have been criticised by members of the Government for this&mdash;as acknowledging the virtues and merits of the Seamen's Union and, indeed, individual members of it. I think it is very important for us all to recognise that the Seamen's Union has done many good things. My position is on the record, yet tonight the honourable member for Shortland in his utterances has tried to indicate the exact opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the example used by the honourable member, in saying that I would support the situation on the Burmese ship where a fellow has lost two fingers, is straight-out and utterly ridiculous. It is nonsense. I suggest that the honourable member, in implying that I or other members of the Opposition would support that situation, is not being at all honest. I think the honourable member for Shortland would concede that that was simply rhetoric and I hope other members of the House understand that as well. We simply do not support that type of activity. It is not fair&mdash;nor is it honest&mdash;to suggest that we would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise in the debate tonight that the Bill which is before us deals with a great deal of reform which has been undertaken on the Australian waterfront and, specifically, in the shipping industry. I note that the Government likes to take full credit for the reforms which have taken place over the last few years. It conveniently ignores&mdash;as I am sure the honourable member for Shortland would recognise&mdash;the initiatives undertaken by the coalition Government in 1982 when the then Minister for Transport, Ralph Hunt, initiated reforms which have led to considerable changes within the industry, such as reductions in the size of crew levels on board ships, and which have been followed through by this Government in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are debating these matters tonight, I think it is worth while that we recognise that these reforms were initiated by a coalition government. We would know this from the history of the Seamen's Union&mdash;it is well recognised in its comments and history books. I make that point tonight in order to keep the matters and views which are before the House properly balanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing which is worth remembering is that in the course of my comments tonight I have said that there is some need for further consideration of the matter. These comments have been taken up by the honourable member for Shortland. He has suggested once again that the Opposition, with its usual antipathy, hatred and lack of recognition of the seafaring industry, is attempting to block good and proper legislation. According to the honourable member, we would be here trying to block it forever and a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I make the point that we are nearly at the tenth anniversary of the election of the Labor Party to government, yet we are dealing with a matter which the honourable member claims has been in urgent need of reform for a long time. If it has been in such urgent need of reform, I put the question to the honourable member for Shortland: why has it taken this Government 10 years to do it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned in my own remarks&mdash;and I think the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) mentioned it also&mdash;this matter began in 1987 under the Luntz report. Why has it taken from 1987 to the end of 1992 for this matter to be brought forward if it is so urgent? I think the honourable member for Shortland knows the answer: this Government has not undertaken the reform of this very important issue as speedily as it ought to have. If it is going to blame the Opposition for trying to delay anything&mdash;which I contest is the case&mdash;it should recognise that it has been responsible for more delay than anything the Opposition tried to do in times past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to recognise the comments that have been made. The honourable member for Shorthand took up the point about the matter of suicide and the onus of responsibility being placed on the employer if an employee commits suicide. It is interesting that for the statement, `Well, if a person commits suicide, it is the employer's responsibility to undertake the cost of compensation', the justification is, `Well, it is in the CERC Act'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, it should be remembered that the CERC Act is under review. It is not under review because everything within it is right. It is under review because people recognise that some things in it are wrong. If we have to justify the responsibility of the employer under this Act, including suicide, on the basis that it is in the CERC Act, then I make the point that two wrongs do not make a right. Indeed, it is rather ironic that, if a person wants to commit suicide at work, then the employer is totally liable whereas, if the same person commits suicide in his home, the employer is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole matter is quite illogical and deserves further investigation and debate. It is this very point that I make tonight. It is one of the reasons why I suggest that this matter needs to be looked at by the Government between the time it leaves this place and the time it moves into the Senate for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland made an appeal to our emotions. He said that the Opposition's attempts to deny the passage of this legislation is to treat seafarers differently from public servants. Indeed, an injury to a seafarer has to be equal to an injury to a public servant. One would say, by logic, `Yes, of course it is. An injury to anybody is equal to the other'. But the point is that, under the current compensation for injury and death that prevails right throughout the work force, there are differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person in one State is treated differently from another person if he is injured or killed in the course of his employment. Indeed, the same applies between different industries. So there is already a difference. I am not arguing that a Commonwealth public servant's injury is greater than a seafarer's injury. I am arguing that for the first time we see the terms and conditions of a Commonwealth public servant being imposed by legislation on a sector of the private industry. I make that as a point for recognition. It is a point that certainly some members of the industry are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who listened to the honourable member for Shortland in this debate tonight would have sworn that the Opposition was opposing this legislation. Indeed, listening to him, I thought to myself: my goodness I must have got my speech wrong, because I thought I was getting up here and saying that the Opposition was not opposing the principle and main effect of this legislation. Indeed, it supports the need for change, the need for upgrading of this legislation, to bring rehabilitation and compensation for seafarers into line with modern day standards. Listening to the speech of the honourable member for Shortland, one would have thought that I was totally opposed to it, and the Opposition subsequently totally opposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, let me reiterate tonight that the Opposition does not oppose the upgrading of this benefit, compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers. It is long overdue. It needs to be done. But we do raise some legitimate points, points which Luntz raises in his own review that was commenced in 1987, where he talks about the need to establish a community level or a community standard for compensation, for death benefits and for rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would say that the community standard that Luntz talked of in his recommendation a few years ago has not been established. The Government, in lieu of establishing a community service, has simply grabbed the CERC Act off the shelf and said, `Let's apply it in this particular instance to seafarers'. I think Luntz was right in his recommendations a few years ago. That was the very thing I raised today. I believe there is a need for this to be properly considered and properly debated, as I am sure it will be between now and its passage through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a Bill which the Opposition at this point does not oppose. However, we have particular concerns which we have tried to raise as honestly and as comprehensively as possible. The old rhetoric that comes from experienced members of the Labor Party, such as the honourable member for Shortland, do not do justice to the Opposition's attitude to the maritime industry. We recognise the importance of it. I have made speeches on previous occasions which highlight the very things that the honourable member for Shortland has tried to highlight tonight; that is, the potential income earning capacity of the shipping industry, and the need for it to expand in order to create jobs and to earn foreign income for Australia. We all recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not the sort of person who goes against seafarers simply because they are seafarers, or wharfies simply because they are wharfies. Indeed, on many occasions I have gone on the record being critical&mdash;and in many cases most critical&mdash;of management in the shipping industry. I think that the management within our stevedoring industry is equally if not more to blame for the inefficiencies that are inherent within that industry. So let us not get carried away with the old, tired rhetoric that comes from experienced members of the Labor Party. I just make that point because I think we need to get some balance into the debate tonight. I thank the House for the opportunity to make those points, and I thank the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Shortland for saying things that have brought me to my feet for a second time this evening. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore is up there leading the charge against cabotage. I interpret what he said tonight to mean that he is not proposing the abolition of cabotage. I think I am entitled to say that, after the nice things he has just said about the Australian seafaring industry, its opportunities for expansion and the progress that has been made. Contrary to his suggestion that I have never recognised Ralph Hunt, I say that Ralph Hunt was a decent Minister and a decent man for whom I had a lot of respect and with whom I worked. When he brought down the Crawford report we supported its recommendations strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we went on much further from there. One has to recall that Ralph Hunt had a terrible time trying to get the Crawford inquiry established; he had a terrible time getting the approval of Cabinet to say what he said on 2 February 1982 when he tabled the report in the House. He does deserve recognition. I have given it in the past and I am happy to give it again if that makes the honourable member for Gilmore happy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore cannot on the one hand argue all the attributes of the Australian seafaring industry and on the other hand argue about cabotage and opening up the Australian domestic shipping transport industry to itinerant tramps from around the world. We are nearing the end of an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into shipping safety. What we have found during that inquiry is horrific&mdash;the sheer, bloody, ruthless exploitation of impoverished Third World seafarers. The industries that use those ships which those seafarers have to crew are out there saying what great benefits they are bringing this country and what great progress they have been making for us in sales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill is the most significant legislation in relation to this great Australian industry since 1989, and I believe it will be until 1999, when some of the provisions of this legislation will be up for review or will be at the end of their period of application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation confirms the Australian Wheat Board's export monopoly or single desk seller status at least until 1999. There is still no sunset provision for that power. The Bill overrides the phase-out of the borrowing guarantee of the current legislation, which was to come down to 80 per cent by the 1994 harvest and then cease. The current legislation has no sunset provision for the Wheat Board's export power, so theoretically that matter does not arise. The reality is that over many years there have been five-year legislative schemes for the wheat industry. Therefore, for the sake of a feeling of security and confirmation for the wheat industry, it is wise and proper that that continuing power be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one problem with regard to that. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech indicated a proviso that if the GATT Round were successful, or if progress were made following a successful GATT Round, that matter would be reviewed. This means that in general this legislation is better than the 1989 legislation, which was to run until the 1994 harvest. There certainly is a need for such legislation because the grain trade war between the European Community and the United States is into one of its very severe phases again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look back to those other horror years of 1986 and 1990 when the export subsidies between those two countries in their chase for markets brought ruinous prices to Australian wheat growers who were caught, unfairly, in the middle of that war. Because this is better legislation, I commend the Government and the Grains Council of Australia, as the representative of the wheat industry, for achieving that better position. I do not expect it from the Government, but it is interesting that neither of those groups has in any way given any recognition to the key role that the coalition parties have played in obtaining this legislation. In my view it is clear that the very solid and stable policy position of the coalition parties is the major reason for this legislation now. To explain this, I refer to the 1989 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme at that time had a guaranteed minimum price arrangement which had cost the Government, in provisions of support, over $200m during the first of those trade wars in 1986. The government of the day did not replace that GMP&mdash;in the sense that it was seen to be no longer sustainable&mdash;with the second option of the wheat industry, that is, an underwriting arrangement, but went straight to a borrowing guarantee arrangement. At that time, in draft legislation prepared by the Labor Government, not only was the domestic power of the Wheat Board to be removed; the export power of the Wheat Board was also to be removed. At that time it was the continued support of the coalition parties for the export power of the Wheat Board that made the change in the Labor Party's attitude in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time also the wheat industry fund was established to provide capital, or to build up a capital base, for the industry against a time when it may not have a borrowing guarantee or any other form of government backing&mdash;and that was to be the case by the 1994 harvest&mdash;to provide capital for the trading arm of the Wheat Board following the deregulation of the domestic wheat market for human consumption purposes and also for joint ventures and value adding arrangements for the Wheat Board and the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At that time, after discussion with the Grains Council of Australia, we said that our policy would be not only the maintenance of the Australian Wheat Board's export power but also, if one likes, the second best option of the industry with regard to some form of security or underwriting for the industry&mdash;and that was underwriting at the 95 per cent rate which was determined at harvest time each year. That was again confirmed for the 1990 election and once again confirmed recently by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind people of the difference between a borrowing guarantee and an underwriting. They have the same starting point; that is, a harvest price is determined by the Wheat Board and ABARE, with the concurrence of the Minister, and that is basically a net price to farmers. The borrowing guarantee is then the aggregated estimated net pool return on the total crop. So an estimate is made of the size of the crop together with the price, and then we have a total figure. That means that if the crop is larger, obviously the value of the borrowing guarantee falls in relation to what is guaranteed per tonne. Because the Wheat Board can never trigger any form of direct government backup assistance, the actual percentage borrowed by the Wheat Board is considerably lower. By the time we get down to 80 per cent&mdash;as it was going to be with the current legislation&mdash;we can question whether it has any real value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the 95 per cent underwriting, we start off with the same figure. But it is a price per tonne underwriting, which means that it is underwritten irrespective of the size of the crop; the Wheat Board can better borrow for a higher harvest payment; the wheat grower can better deal with his bank manager; and, in times of a dramatic fall in price, such as that which would occur with a world wheat war, after that price has been declared, the liability of the Government may be incurred&mdash;that is, the support of the Government may be needed to maintain that underwriting. On the calculations we have made with the Wheat Board, that would have been the case in that terrible year of 1990 when it would have required a government advance of about $40m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that 1989 legislation and the difficult times with the international wheat wars, the Grains Council put two proposals to the Government to try to improve the situation: a base price proposal, and a GMP proposal&mdash;that is, it attempted to negotiate some better stability for wheat growers. The Government rejected these proposals, and the Grains Council then attempted to obtain some answers from the Government ahead of the forthcoming election as to what its attitude would be post-1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council also indicated that it would prefer to have legislation beyond 1994 in place before this election because of the uncertainty that it believed could prevail in the situation afterwards, the delays that would or could occur with any legislation which would bring it very close to the 1994 deadline, and the need to provide some reassurance to the core markets for Australian wheat which take up to about 70 per cent of our wheat and which provide the premium price; in other words, these markets buy at the ordinary rate and are not affected to the same degree by the EEP or EEC discounted prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Grains Council tried to obtain the Government's confirmation of what its policy would be, it could not obtain any confirmation whatsoever. There followed Grains 2000&mdash;the tripartite discussion group or committee made up of the Wheat Board, the Grains Council and representatives of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Out of that came the Newco proposal to give the export monopoly to a private organisation, to increase the wheat industry fund contributions because the capital would have to be built up more rapidly, and to obtain some other special concessions with regard to taxation, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council, as the wheat growers' representative body, then embarked upon a series of meetings around Australia. Out of those meetings there appeared to be misrepresentation of the coalition's policy. As a result of those misrepresentations it became necessary for me to restate the coalition policy in stronger terms. That better understanding by wheat growers of the policy and their greater recognition that there was a better alternative, in spite of the fact that we had been regularly saying it for some time and including it in our comparison documents between <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> on the one hand and Government policy on the other, I believe encouraged the rejection by the industry of the Newco proposal. It said to the Grains Council of Australia, `Go back to the Government and negotiate a better arrangement'. The Grains Council did so, and it did obtain a better arrangement. I commend the Government and the Grains Council for that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is only one reason why that was possible. Throughout it all, since 1989, the coalition held firm on the two major elements of policy: the retention of the Wheat Board's export monopoly and an underwriting arrangement which is still better than the Government's improved position, which forms part of this legislation, of a constant 85 per cent borrowing guarantee through to the year 1999. Obviously the deteriorating international situation has added some urgency to the legislation, and it has also provided another element for such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does buy time for the industry until 1999. By that time the wheat industry fund will have built up to between $400m to $500m, providing an adequate base for the industry, if at that time there are changes to the marketing arrangements. Therefore, one would see that industry fund as a transitional arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of concern in parts of the wheat industry, in particular in Western Australia, where it queries on the one hand the levy and whether or not it will increase&mdash;the Minister has indicated the procedure that is necessary before that can occur&mdash;and on the other hand its use for certain value adding activities. In Queensland there is concern, but for a different reason, and that is because the capital provided for the trading activities of the Wheat Board is claimed by Queensland industry representatives to provide unfair competition against their own organisation, Grainco. On my understanding, there is overall support for that wheat industry fund, but there is certainly concern that it should not increase beyond the 2 per cent, that it should be closely monitored and that it be recognised as a transitional levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time the Wheat Board has indicated that there is a need for greater flexibility if it is to achieve what it and the wheat industry want to achieve with regard to sensible joint ventures and value adding. That has been the case for some time. Whether or not there is a need for a separate board, time will tell. That is something that I will closely monitor because I question whether there is such a need for a separate subsidiary company. But we are not trying to impose any sort of opposition to that element of the legislation, other than to monitor it from our point of view and the industry's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the coalition parties do support this legislation. We recognise that it does come in time for the Wheat Board and the wheat industry to provide those guarantees for future contractual arrangements and harvests beyond the present one. As far as the coalition is concerned, the only change to the legislation between now and the review that obviously will occur prior to 1999 will be a change to bring in our underwriting commitment for the 1994 and subsequent harvests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, as has been already pointed out, has three functions, namely, the continuation of the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly status, the extension of the Government's guarantee for Wheat Board borrowings at 85 per cent until June of 1999 and, of course, the continued accumulation of the wheat industry fund. It is in that particular area that I wish to pass most of my comments this evening. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However there was general support for certain elements of these proposals and this support has been embodied in the package of the measures before the House.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These elements are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a continued build-up in the industry's capital base through the wheat industry fund levy;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, I can inform the Minister that he is wrong on two out of those three. There is not industry support for a continued build-up in the industry's capital base through the wheat industry fund. There is in fact at the grassroots level practically no support for that proposal. Of course, I remind the Minister that if we were talking about the role of the Wool Corporation tonight we would be talking about, as people in the industry and taxpayers in the industry have just received, the opportunity to register to cast a vote on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry that the Minister and his predecessor believe is the true representative is the Grains Council of Australia. It would be an interesting race, but I believe I probably democratically personally represent more wheat growers than the Grains Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have been well represented, and they keep voting me back. It will be interesting to see whether both I and the Minister return next time, but I am more like Subzero. The facts of life are that grassroots farmers are deeply concerned about this levy because they cannot afford it. That is the simple fact. I wonder why we can have a Wool Corporation and all the fuss we had about a democratic vote last year, all the remedies that apply and a proper arrangement where I received as a woolgrower the other day my application to register for a vote, yet my wheat growers do not get the same opportunity to express a view on what is a very significant part of their income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter the other day from consultants in my electorate who carry out work for 271 farm businesses in the central and eastern wheat belt. They have done some sums on the effect of the levy at 2 per cent. It is not that long ago that there was speculation that it should increase to the full 5 per cent provided in the 1989 legislation. I would like the Minister to listen to these figures. I do give him credit that he does come in and listen. These consultants give us all the figures and I would be happy to provide the Minister with a copy of them. The wheat industry fund at 2 per cent, expressed as a percentage of the surplus available to wheat growers in the central wheat belt of Western Australia, after operating and financing costs and tax, is 8.35 per cent of their income at that point. For those in the eastern wheat belt, it is 26.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get down to the effect of the wheat industry fund levy, the surplus of capital and personal expenses&mdash;that is, what they have for farm disposable income&mdash;after we get rid of additional items such as depreciation is 20.07 per cent for the central wheat belt and 124 per cent for the eastern wheat belt. I am happy to give these figures to honourable members. These people are finding it very difficult and, consequently, the issue has to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I cannot make the grade in numbers in terms of representation, I can certainly make it in tonnes, particularly in the last couple of years. These same wheat growers are complaining bitterly about a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities. They made that very clear in Western Australia throughout the Newco debate. They do not want to see their hard earned money used to finance ventures of this nature, particularly within Australia. I think some of them can see some value in the attempts to develop flour milling facilities, in other words, captive markets, in foreign countries&mdash;maybe the storage facilities that are being created in Egypt&mdash;but when it comes down to financing ventures in Australia and making them captive, as they are in the meat industry, to the Wally Currans of this world they would rather not do it. They do not want to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wheat growers happen to hold a very simple view that if there is a little bit of spare money around they would like to invest it in their own farm. Most of them at the moment would dearly love to pay off some of their debt. When the wheat industry funds started, at least the Wheat Board, as manager, could get 15 or 16 per cent on the surplus in the short term money market. Today it can get 4 or 5 per cent. So the wheat grower is seeing his money forcefully taken out of his cheque and invested at very low returns while he is still being forced to pay his bank manager real interest rates as high as 10 per cent on his own borrowings. It is lousy economics for these people. The present 2 per cent level, when the percentage of the surplus which the eastern wheat belt farmer has available for personal use and capital expenditure reaches 124 per cent&mdash;in other words, the levy is putting him into a position where he loses money on his enterprise&mdash;is quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, the Minister is right: he has huge support amongst grassroots wheat growers for a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly. They want that and they do not want it fiddled with. They like it the way it is. They do not particularly want it corporatised, and they certainly do not want it privatised. That is a fact. I guess one out of three is a pretty good score for the Minister. Sometimes it is worse than that with some of his judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that it is hurting people; it is not necessary; and, of course, it was implemented originally with the Newco agenda&mdash;although the so-called industry representatives, to which the Minister defers, knew very well when they sold out on the old guaranteed minimum price formula for the wheat industry fund where they were headed. Newco was already being spelt out in capital letters back at the Grains Council. I think the Minister has to ask himself the question whether the Grains Council is an appropriate representative body once we start levying people or whether, as it is in the Wool Corporation, each taxpayer should have a say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point very strongly because I feel that these people are entitled to a say about their own money, just as they are in the Wool Corporation. It is most important to these people because the only way at the moment that a wheat grower in my electorate can get an opportunity to have even minimal influence over the decisions of the Grains Council is by buying a union ticket. He has to join a rural association. That does not do much for him either unless he then becomes sufficiently active at branch level, at zone level and at a State conference level. Then, of course, if he is in one association, he actually gets the right to vote for somebody on the Grains Council; if he is in the other one in Western Australia, he does not even get that right, having paid hundreds of dollars to be a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a large number of people would be quite willing to do that, if only their bank manager would let them. But the bank manager goes through their budget and says, `You are over what I think is reasonable. You cannot borrow this amount of money. A few things have to go'. One of the first things to go is their membership to a farmer organisation. People are openly disenfranchised. Therefore, the situation is wrong and should not be left that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By far the majority of the wheat growers of Western Australia do not want the wheat industry fund. They do not see the need for it. In the Minister's second reading speech we read the argument that there has to be a time when the Wheat Board needs this capital base so that it can establish its own borrowings. At first it has an asset provided to it by wheat growers, namely its wheat stocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally cannot see under the current arrangements why the Government wants to discontinue the Government guarantee. As I explained to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) during the 1989 debate, the chances of paying out on the new guarantee are nil. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has set the price. He waits until the harvesters are in the paddock before he sets the price. He has all the information about world production at that point and knows very well that the majority of the stocks will clear within months. The Government is only guaranteeing 85 per cent of it and, furthermore, as I said at the time when the Minister was setting his price, `What is 100 per cent of nothing?'. The Government is only giving a percentage guarantee on a limited amount of money. The simple facts are that the industry should have the guarantee maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other reason why my members and farmers generally oppose the establishment of this capital base. The simple fact is that again they say that, if it is necessary to get 85 per cent of the value of their wheat in a harvest price and they have to put up some of that money themselves, why do they not just keep the money and take a smaller harvest price? In some years they do not have a wheat crop because it does not rain. They do not have any wheat to sell, so they do not get a harvest payment. If they had retained the money and not put it into this wheat industry fund, they would at least have that to help out their enterprise. But, no, the Wheat Board has that money. The logic does not even add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would be better off with what we propose, which is a retention of the Wheat Board in its present form and a 95 per cent guarantee. That is the ultimate. If the Government is going to withdraw that guarantee, then the second best option is to have a smaller harvest payment and have the wheat industry fund levy in the bank. The Minister should please remember that that is the next problem. Western Australian wheat growers are by far the greatest contributors to this and will continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the next stage of the Minister's advice to us in his second reading speech, when he gave us the formula for the future. He said that the wheat industry fund would be used as follows&mdash;this worries me because I doubt that 2 per cent will provide $400m-plus: 80 per cent of future contributions for building up the capital base, and around 20 per cent of future contributions together with around $30m of current equity for value adding activities by the Wheat Board's subsidiary company. As I said, that is totally anathema to my people. They do not want to be involved. If they want to be involved, they are quite prepared to buy shares themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wool industry in Western Australia quite a big company operation was put together by farmers each putting in a couple of bales of wool and giving these people the opportunity to value add. They put it in on that basis knowing full well that they were taking a big risk with it. They went in with their eyes open and they are happy about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not happy about someone sitting here in Canberra with a university degree and making judgments about their money. They are better businessmen than that. They still have ringing in their ears the disastrous business decisions of not that long ago which were made by some of their representatives in the Wool Corporation, and they do not see this money going the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, from the point of Western Australian wheat growers, there is $100m of current equity for the Wheat Board's trading division operations. We are paying 30-plus per cent on it and practically do not get a penny back; we do not get any benefit. The simple reason is that just 3 per cent of Western Australia's wheat production goes to the domestic market. If the wheat industry fund were given back to us, we could give the Western Australian consumers two-thirds of the wheat and be no worse off. But only 3 per cent goes to the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $100m is spent principally in New South Wales. There is no benefit to the people who are providing the money. Why should this continue? Why should we have to forcibly fund the Wheat Board again? If people in other States where the trading in the domestic market is much larger and much more diverse want to have the Wheat Board acting in that area&mdash;and a few who were very committed to that approach find it has not worked all that well for them, but that is another story&mdash;why can those people not fund the Wheat Board to trade on their behalf? The simple fact is that they do not and that Western Australian wheat growers get a very raw deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case, the wheat growers do not like 80 per cent of their money going to the Wheat Board for its capital base. They like even less 20 per cent plus $30m going to fund activities which seem to be much more involved with the Minister's past activities and associations and trade union mates; they seem to be the ones who will be the beneficiaries.

It could get the animals for nothing, because the only alternative we had&mdash;and we were obliged to do it&mdash;was to shoot them on the property and bury them, and we did that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. This was the situation. It is a fact that the Minister is now telling members of the wheat industry, `Put up your money and we will value add your product, but in the process it is very likely that we will have to pay you less for your wheat'. Maybe we will get to the situation where we will have to deliver the wheat for nothing. I do not see any sense in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not much good the Minister joking with his colleague about it, because he is getting some good advice that unfortunately he never got in his previous career. As I said, the Minister is getting advice from the only electorate in Australia that is currently considered a rural electorate by the National Farmers Federation and by someone who grows wheat and who talks to wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I brought some evidence of that to this Parliament recently when the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), whose electorate I also wander around a little, claimed that I spend more time in his electorate than my own. We disproved that, but I am in his electorate often enough to hear all the complaints about him and his Party. I suggest to the Minister that he not get too friendly with the honourable member because he will not be back&mdash;and I say that on the presumption that the Minister might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the electorate where I live is a very strong Labor area and the people there do not want to vote for Paul Keating and his mates. That is another bit of advice for the Minister. If members of the Labor Party are thinking of restructuring their Party, they should not include the honourable member for Swan in the hierarchy because he will not be around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I am very pleased to see you back in the chamber at this time. This legislation, which has the support of the Opposition simply because it is a bit of an improvement on the 1989 Act in this regard, is not fair to wheat growers, particularly in Western Australia. As individual wheat growers, they do not support the wheat industry fund. They certainly do not, as individual wheat growers, want to have their hard earned money spent on value adding. So this is a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Minister will also take on board my remarks regarding representation. Wheat growers are not represented at the moment. They are paying good money and, as a parallel to those in the wool industry, they are entitled to a vote if they pay the tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Poly Chloro Biphenyls (PCBs) are the only known toxic material being handled on site in sealed containers, forming part of the operating equipment. A management plan is in place to progressively replace the amount of PCBs in operating equipment and the components in store by non-PCB components. The disposal of equipment items containing PCBs is carried out by Department of Administrative Services (DAS) under contractual arrangement and the items are transported in an approved container to an approved DAS storage facility off-site. Action is in hand by the Chief of Logistics, Naval Support Command, to ultimately dispose of all components containing PCBs in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey has been conducted recently to determine if there has been any PCB contamination in the soil and ground water in the vicinity of the Belconnen Naval Transmission Station (BNTS) and some small areas of low level contamination have been detected. The current status of the station is that Defence is waiting for an advice from the ACT Department of the Environment, Land and Planning concerning the significance of this contamination with reference to ACT planning considerations. Further action by Defence is dependent on their advice.</PARA>
