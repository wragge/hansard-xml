<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These two Bills provide funding for government and non-government schools. The first Bill, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, is to provide some additional funding for this year. The second Bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill, is the principal appropriation Bill for school funding for both government and non-government schools. This second Bill appropriates a very large sum of money, some $2.87 billion, which will be used for recurrent and capital purposes, the Government's so-called national equity programs, school language programs and other joint programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers are entitled to ask what they are getting for the money. It is clear that the expenditure foreshadowed through this legislation is accompanied by a great deal of activity and, one must say, an increasing number of committees and regulatory authorities. But there is a bottom line to these debates, that is, what are young Australians actually learning? Are they learning what they need to know to function effectively in modern society? Are they being adequately prepared for an internationally competitive world? This is obviously the key criterion. It is what the Australian people want to know about the expenditure of this money. Is it being well spent? The measure that this criterion provides enables us to assess the Government's success or failure in its school policies over its almost 10 years in office. Measured against this criterion, the Government has failed&mdash;and failed miserably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this appropriation is essential for the running of schools in this country, the Opposition will not oppose it. But I will be moving a second reading amendment in respect of the second Bill which condemns the Government for its failure to pursue policies which will lift standards of education in Australia to international levels and for the unnecessary and unjustified restrictions which the Government is imposing on the right of parents to choose the appropriate school for their child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinary fact that, after almost 10 years of this Government, up to one in five Australians do not have functional literacy or numeracy. Many of these, very disturbingly, are young Australians fresh from school. Anecdotal evidence of this is accumulating into a massive pile. The Government throughout its term of office, for reasons which I shall explore in the course of my remarks, has failed to show any great interest in attempting to measure and monitor the standards of learning which are actually being achieved. But the evidence is nevertheless becoming overwhelming. I would like to take a few minutes to inform honourable members of some of this evidence so that they can gain a feel for the consequences of the Government's failure to keep its eyes fixed firmly on the ball in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey of the Regency College of TAFE in South Australia found that 40 per cent of apprentices and 51 per cent of pre-vocational students had reading comprehension ages of between only eight and 12 years. Thirty-four per cent were unable to pass trade relevant maths set at year 10 level. The Government, to its credit, appointed a committee headed by Brian Finn, the Managing Director of IBM, to investigate post-compulsory schooling and training. The Finn Committee came up with a very disturbing conclusion. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is firm evidence that a significant number of school leavers do not have even very basic literacy skills adequate to their training or work contexts.</PARA>
<PARA>Last year, the University of Melbourne decided to test entrants' skills in mathematics. It found that of those students whom the university admitted less than half, when they came to their first year studies, had the required training for tertiary study. Only 44 per cent of first year students passed the test that the university had set down. Honourable members from Victoria will not be surprised to hear that the results showed that the maths ability of students with the Victorian certificate of education was 14 per cent lower than that of students who had studied under the old higher school certificate. The test covered skills from basic problem solving to sophisticated calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent study of adult literacy found that 68 per cent of those who attempted to articulate the issues behind a newspaper editorial were unable to do so. Sixty-eight per cent, according to this study, found it difficult to read and understand a newspaper editorial. Thirty-one per cent of those who attempted to calculate the change from a $5 note after ordering two specified items from a menu were unable to do so. Twenty-two per cent could not enter the date correctly on a bank deposit slip, and 46 per cent were unable to work out from an aspirin packet the correct dosage for a child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious situation. It is not one which has emerged suddenly in the national consciousness. It is a problem which has been there for a number of years. The message to the Government has been clear. Action, and urgent action, is needed to lift the standards of learning in this country, and to give people the knowledge and the skills they need to function effectively in Australian society. The Government has failed to take such action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that these problems relate not only to basic and functional literacy and numeracy but that they extend also to core areas of knowledge, such as science. The Australian Council for Educational Research published last year the results of a study which compared the levels of science achievement of year 10 Australian students with the levels of achievement that were being achieved in 1970 and with international levels. This study found two things: it found that the levels of achievement had not declined since 1970, compared within this country, but it found also that the relative standards of achievement of Australian students had dropped quite markedly when compared with the levels of achievement of their peers in other industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is falling behind, falling behind in a world which does not owe us a living, in a world in which we have to compete. Yet we are equipping our young people less and less well, according to the results of this study, in key areas of knowledge which must underpin an internationally competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young Australians' cultural literacy is as big a problem as their command of their language. A study by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, which surveyed some 4,000 year 9 students, found that only 33 per cent could locate East Germany&mdash;which, of course, then existed but now no longer exists&mdash;on a map. Only 18 per cent of them could name Mr Hawke as Malcolm Fraser's successor to the prime ministership. A study by the Institute of Public Affairs of year 10 students in both government and non-government schools found that only 22 per cent of 232 students surveyed could name the three levels of government in Australia, and only 28 per cent could identify the event commemorated by Anzac Day. Only one-quarter could name the two Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. Only 42 per cent could identify the service provided by Bankcard. Eighty per cent were unable to name the year of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a generation of young people in this country who are not learning sufficient information about the nature of the country and the society in which they live to function in that society. They are unable to comprehend the discussion of public issues in the media and one in five of them do not have the basic functional skills needed for the workplace. Of course, as we know, unemployment is very much related to the quality of the skills and training that young people have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a record, despite this immense expenditure and despite these scores of committees, of dangerous and damaging educational failure. How has this occurred? The Government will tell you that its record is enormously positive, and it will refer to the growing numbers of young Australians going through the schooling systems. It will tell you that participation rates have risen. It will tell you that it has worked closely with the teachers unions to encourage the development of national teaching, curriculum and professional requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we to make of these claims? Take participation. Participation has been rising for decades. It rose from a 22 per cent retention rate in 1967 to 40 per cent in 1983. Let us make no mistake about that. The claims in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the record of the previous coalition Government are totally false and are readily exposed by consulting the information. Participation has been rising for decades, it continues to rise, and it will rise whether this Government wants it to rise or not. Tragically, in recent years it has risen very rapidly because of the gross economic mismanagement which has deprived so many of our young people of the opportunity to gain experience in the workplace. To that extent, what has happened in recent years is actually a measure of dramatic policy failure on the part of the Government rather than any educational success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not be fooled by this. Every Australian knows that the real issue is not the number of people who are being processed through the system. The real issue is what they are learning, and whether they are gaining the knowledge and skills that they need to survive and to get jobs in an internationally competitive world. The answer is overwhelming; even the answer from the Government's own committees is that they are not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is that the Government has lost sight of the main game in education. It has pursued an agenda which has been largely irrelevant to the educational needs of this country. Its education agendas have been dominated by its dependence on its allies in the Australian Teachers Union and other unions. It has been much more concerned to pursue national industrial awards than it has been to pursue national standards. Those unions&mdash;and, unfortunately, many in the bureaucracy&mdash;have positively resisted the effort to give the public the information that it is entitled to have about the quality of learning that young people are achieving. The Government has pursued national uniformity and curriculum, even if this means national mediocrity. The Australian Mathematical Sciences Council has made clear that, if it is adopted, the national profile for mathematics that has been developed may well lead to a significant decline in mathematical standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has pursued a concept of equity which means that it is better to have uniform deprivation and uniform low standards than to encourage the best from every pupil. Until very recently, under immense pressure from the Opposition, it was ideologically unacceptable even to suggest that something should be done to bring the best out of the gifted and talented students in this country. We all know that, despite the Government's claims to be helping the disadvantaged, the most disadvantaged group in the country&mdash;students in rural Australia&mdash;has been significantly neglected by this Government and its policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has simply failed to address the crucial questions in education. What is it that produces excellence in schooling? Under pressure from the Opposition, the Government's rhetoric has begun to change. It has begun to say rhetorically, `Yes, we do care about quality, we do care about excellence, and we are doing something about it'. The record speaks for itself about the effectiveness of what has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Government has done. I will mention a couple of initiatives that have been taken in recent years. The Government set up the national project on the quality of teaching and learning. It has a very fine sounding title; but when you draw aside the veil on this national project, what do you find? As we would expect under this Government, we find the employers lined up on one side of the table and the unions lined up on the other side. When we ask what contribution this national project has made to the quality of teaching and learning, what do we find? Virtually nothing of any significance has come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one thing has come out of it. We now have a proposal for a national teaching council to build up a professional structure for teachers in this country. That sounds good. Without a high status and highly respected teaching profession, a very professional teaching order, there is no possibility that we will have education of international standards. But is this national teaching council the mechanism to achieve that? Of course not. If we look at the documents that have been issued to support it, we find that this is an attempt by the Australian Teachers Union and its mates in the Government to hijack the move towards professionalism. This is not even to be a council which fully represents teachers; teachers are to have a bare majority on the council. For a long time there was a view that perhaps teachers would not even have a majority on it, but we in the Opposition criticised that and the Government has tried to amend its proposal in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an effort to gain national registration of teachers, to lock teachers into uniform and rigid national awards to make sure that any move towards teacher professionalism which might give teachers a degree of independence from the industrial relations system is nipped in the bud and that the whole process is captured and controlled by the Australian Teachers Union and its mates in the Government. This is unacceptable, and the people of this country know that this is not the route by which to achieve excellence in schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had the great initiative of the good schools project. There was $10m to be allocated over several years to find out&mdash;to find out, mind you&mdash;what a good school was. As if we did not know that a good school is a school with effective educational leadership, with clear educational goals, with values of achievement and with harmonious staff relations, which is prepared to monitor and evaluate its own performance. That is what a good school is and everybody knows that. We did not need $10m to find that out. Now, after a year or so, this project has been completely changed because the Government knows that that initial brief was given solely for propaganda purposes and had no substance to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach to schooling, increasingly centralised controls and bureaucratic regulation is not the road to achieving improved equality of education. We need self-managing schools in this country where principals have the ability to offer leadership, where staff conditions and employment can be handled without endless bureaucracy, where there is freedom to establish proper discipline policies, where confrontational industrial relations are left at the front gate and where there is a determination to achieve and a willingness to demonstrate and evaluate high excellence. A basic principle is that parents should have the right to choose the school to which they send their child and that schools should be accountable to parents and not to the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's record in establishing these conditions for excellent schooling is one of unmitigated failure. It has positively set out to diminish the exercise of parental choice. It has done nothing to encourage the development of effective school based management, or outstanding teaching, or satisfactory monitoring of standards. The Government's failure has done considerable damage to state school systems. It has encouraged parents to vote with their feet to leave the state school systems, to go to non-government schools where they can have confidence that a disciplined environment will prevail and that classrooms will not be disrupted by industrial action and where they know their values will be reflected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a condemnation of the Government that in 1991 there were fewer pupils in government schools than there were in 1976, while over the same period the number of pupils in non-government schools had risen by over 30 per cent. There was a message in this, but it was a message the Government failed to heed. The response of the Government's union mates was to establish a policy designed to stem the tide&mdash;to make it difficult for parents to transfer their students from government to non-government schools; to make it expensive to exercise choice&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member knows that that is true. The policy was also designed to prohibit parents from establishing a new school or expanding an existing one unless it posed no threat to numbers at existing government schools. This is the notorious and infamous new schools policy. This legislation embodies these policies and, while making some adjustments to them, retains them in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government set out to address the symptoms, but not the substance of the problems. As a consequence, in attempting to make non-government schooling more expensive&mdash;to prevent low income parents from exercising choice and to discriminate against them in the system&mdash;the Government allowed a decline of some 30 per cent in the real value of capital grants to non-government schools. It also froze per capita grants to a number of categories of non-government schools, with a highly divisive policy. Per capita grants were not increased. In the higher fee schools, parents&mdash;many of whom are not high income earners&mdash;are prepared to sacrifice their holidays or to have both parents working in order to finance the education that they want. But members of the Government would not recognise that. They divide society into the rich and the poor and do not pursue policies which help low income people, discriminating against those who make an effort and who place a high value on education. Let us have none of this divisive rhetoric that we constantly get from the other side of the House on education. Where per capita grants were increased, they were not increased at a rate that compensated for the disastrous impact of the recession on low income families. As a consequence, many low income families have found that they are increasingly unable to exercise educational choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of non-government schooling has been increased by a whole range of government policies&mdash;by the training guarantee levy, by the superannuation guarantee and by the impact of the fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax on car parking is going to cost some non-government schools half a million dollars a year. Is that what the Government intends? Does it intend to impose this added cost&mdash;the cost of new levels of award salaries and new curriculum&mdash;on the right of parents to choose these schools? The increasing difficulty that parents have in exercising educational choice flows directly from the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some increases in per capita grants in this legislation, but they are nowhere near adequate to give real choice to many low income families. The divisive policy of freezing grants to some, while increasing them to others, is maintained. There are some increases in capital grants but they are only half as much as we in the coalition judge to be minimal to allow non-government schools to meet the immense pressures of educational change. The increases in per capita grants are totally unsatisfactory. Throughout the rest of this decade, parents choosing a school in the non-government sector will receive from the coalition some $1 billion more than they will receive under the policies projected in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new schools policy in this legislation&mdash;the policy designed to lock parents into the government system&mdash;is modified in only one respect. The Hudson report on five Greek Orthodox schools in Melbourne showed that this policy was destroying the financial viability of these schools. Many parents wanted to send their children to those schools but were prohibited from doing so by the maximum numbers imposed, under this policy, on those schools. Those numbers have been lifted for the existing schools. However, this grossly inequitable policy is to be maintained for new schools and, indeed, has been tightened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members may know, this policy freezes funding for new schools at what is described as needs level 6, even though the resource needs of many of these schools are much greater. These schools are being discriminated against, not because they are wealthy, but because they are new and because they recognise the fact that parents are not satisfied with what is happening in education at the present time. They are discriminated against, and yet the Government says it supports needs funding. This is a lie, as it applies to pupils attending new schools under this policy. This policy has no reference to the needs of schools. Many thousands of low income parents are making an immense sacrifice to set up the school that they want. This Government is discriminating against them, even though it knows that the needs of those schools would justify and entitle them to needs funding at a much higher needs level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new schools policy should be completely abandoned. The coalition will abandon it and we will give parents the right to choose their child's school. We will do that not just in making a choice between the Government and non-government sector, but we will do a great deal to expand the right of parents to choose their school within the Government sector as well because, in the end, the quality of education in this country is going to depend on the quality of the Government sector schools, where most students will continue to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that there is so much discontent with the Government's performance as it relates to the Government school system. One of the important developments in schooling in recent times has been the growing interest of the business community which has recognised with deep and growing concern the failure to which I have referred. The Industry-Education Forum, recently established, has issued a declaration of goals for Australian schools. In launching these goals, Brian Loton, the former managing director of BHP, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we truly believe that Australia's future depends on becoming competitive, then one of the first things that must be set right is the education system. We cannot have a world class workforce without world  class schools.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry-Education Forum stated a number of goals, including the measurement and reporting of standards against national and international standards&mdash;something the Government has failed to do. The Industry-Education Forum, in a significant statement, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's public school systems, as traditionally structured and managed, are unlikely to achieve the necessary improvements to be at the forefront of world standards. Centralised control, bureaucratic procedures and industrial relations constraints have typified traditionally organised public education systems and have restricted their possibilities for improvement. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry-Education Forum puts forward a whole agenda for devolution of authority to schools combined with a proper monitoring of standards. The coalition strongly endorses these views. It is wrong, as the Government has done, to neglect the tremendous potential of the Government school systems. If schools are given the autonomy and accountability for their own performance, they can, and they will, achieve at international levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made an enormous commitment to education in Fightback. It is one of the top priority areas within our whole program. We will be making a major effort not merely to ensure that education in this country is resourced at the levels it needs to be, but that the structural reforms which are necessary to create top quality, self-managing schools to give parents the right to choose their schools, because they are the best monitors of the quality of their children's education, and to provide a system whereby the Australian community will at last be given the information to which it is entitled about the quality of learning that is taking place in the nation's schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable member for Goldstein to hang on for a moment. It went up 2 per cent. That was the effort when the Opposition was in government. Those opposite do not take education or schools seriously. They actually believe that children are to be accounted for when they turn 15 or 16. They have no attitude to young children nor to the school sector in Australia, and they never have had. The provision of these two Bills, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill, provide ongoing stability and security to all Australian schools.

Its policies supported the  program funding&mdash;taxpayers' money, the money of the people in the gallery&mdash;to white ant those existing schools and to just wipe them: do not allow them any resources; do not upgrade them; wipe them out of the way; spend taxpayers' money irresponsibly; do not help the status quo; and just wipe the problem under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little bit like the attitude of the honourable member for Goldstein to quality learning. When he talks about quality learning, he is talking about, in a taxonomy of education objectives, the lowest intellectual skill possible, knowledge. He does not talk about comprehension, insight, perception, analysis, synthesis, problem solving, translation, or prediction. He does not have an attitude about learning. He comes from a blinkered view and he thinks that learning is something that is just knowledge. Has he not heard of a library? People can get skills and information out of a library that are far more important in having positive relationships with their peers and with adults, and being able to know how to learn, not what to learn. Learning changes dramatically over a period of time. </PARA>

I know that some schools in my electorate are pretty wary of change, but they all acknowledge that the disadvantaged schools program in particular needs an overhaul. This new broad-banding arrangement will provide the financial assistance under four elements, focusing on the issues of access, equity, incentives and national priorities. These new elements will involve a broad-banding of some existing targeted programs from 1994 subject to adequate agreements being struck with school authorities in the matters of accountability, information and evaluation network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the recent presidential election, education was very high on the agenda, along with health. Of course, they are two issues that seem to have passed this Opposition by, because I suppose Governor Clinton's victory in the recent presidential election was a victory that really emphasised the points of view that are going on in this Government, namely, that it is a victory for the common good over those selfish individual interests espoused by the honourable member for Goldstein; a victory for the common good; a victory for the community over the individual; a victory in terms of taking every one into account in the nation; and a victory for cooperation over divisiveness. </PARA>

It is not based on some ideology that splits and divides and conquers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from some minor changes to the sales tax laws and the extension of the availability of the sales tax exemption for UHF transmitters until 1 January 1994, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill are concerned with the reimposition of the 20 per cent sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ. The House will recall that earlier this year the High Court ruled in the Mutual Pools case that the legislation purporting to impose sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ was unconstitutional and was, therefore, of no effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of that decision was that manufactured swimming pools were subject to sales tax because they are sold as goods, whereas no tax was payable on pools constructed in situ. This was the anomaly that the Government originally sought to rectify with its legislation in 1986, which was subsequently found unconstitutional by the High Court of Australia earlier this year. Now the Government will have another go at imposing the sales tax measure with legislation of different design but intended to have the same effect as the original legislation introduced in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two Bills will impose sales tax on swimming pools, spas and hot-tub shells that are constructed in situ, at the site. A pool builder or owner-builder will be liable for sales tax immediately after the construction of an in situ pool shell is completed. In the case of a builder, this will be so if the pool contract was or is entered into on or after 1 January 1993. In the case of the owner-builder, this will apply if construction of the shell commences on or after 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be hoped that this legislation when it comes into operation will be more workable than that which it replaces, which was an unmitigated disaster for all concerned. The previous legislation was an object lesson in the iniquitous nature of the wholesale sales tax regime and how not to run an indirect tax system. Unfortunately, it is not a lesson taken to heart by Labor, as it continues to foist onto the Australian people a nonsense wholesale sales tax system. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recounting the history of this measure since it is an excellent example of the wholesale sales tax system at its worst, and joins the list of other equally pernicious wholesale sales tax disasters such as the 50 per cent sales tax that was introduced on expensive vehicles not so long ago, and which was subsequently abandoned after it devastated the high priced car industry, with all the implications for employment and jobs in that sector of the motor trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1986 legislation implementing the then new tax on pools built in situ deemed that a concrete pool constructed on site was a good for the purposes of the sales tax law, and imposed a complicated set of artificial deeming provisions by which the sales tax value for the pool was to be calculated and the tax then collected. These provisions were extremely complex and difficult to apply in practice. Numerous errors were made in either overpaying or underpaying the tax, and there was also widespread avoidance of the tax, taking advantage of a loophole whereby owner-builders were not obliged to pay the impost. This led to a remarkable proliferation in the number of so-called owner-builders at the expense of legitimate pool builders, who paid the tax and lost business as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia obtained legal advice that the 1986 tax was unconstitutional, and subsequently launched a challenge to its validity in the High Court. In February of this year, the High Court handed down its decision in what became the Mutual Pools case. In that decision the Court ruled that the 1986 amendments to the sales tax legislation did not conform with a requirement in section 55 of the Constitution requiring that laws imposing duties of excise deal with duties of excise only. The tax was thus found to be constitutionally invalid and said by the High Court never to have legally come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was then faced with the task of refunding some 10,000 swimming pool owners for the constitutionally invalid impost that was paid on swimming pools built between 1986 and early 1992. The Swimming Pool and Spa Association claims that its members are entitled to a refund of $8m paid under an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office plus $2m in interest, and that its members paid $20m to the ATO in the period from 1986 up to mid-1990, when the agreement with the ATO was entered into. Millions of dollars in sales tax was also collected from non-Association members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the High Court challenge was in progress the Swimming Pool and Spa Association advised its members to stop making payments to the Taxation Office&mdash;not unnaturally&mdash;and to pay those moneys into a trust fund instead. The fund was designed to protect members against the possibility that the High Court challenge then under way might fail and that the builders would have to pay the outstanding tax to the ATO, in which case the payments could be met out of the trust fund. On the other hand, if the High Court challenge were to prove successful for the Association, the funds could then be returned to Association members, undoubtedly on better terms than those provided by the Tax Office in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Office agreed to this arrangement, but for about three months only before changing its mind and demanding that payments be resumed by way of monthly returns. The Association's accountants, Ernst and Young, and the Tax Office then entered into an agreement whereby pool builders would resume making payments to the Tax Office, including the funds accumulated in the trust fund. But these trust funds were to be fully refundable under the agreement if the Tax Office lost the High Court case, plus interest at the rate applicable to overpaid tax. It was on the basis of this agreement that pool builders resumed making payments to the ATO for the illegal tax and handed over the money that the Association was holding for the pool builders in the trust fund. This agreement is well documented in an exchange of letters between Ernst and Young and the Australian Taxation Office dated November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the effects of the High Court decision is that pool builders who were able to pass on the sales tax impost to their customers in the form of higher prices for swimming pools would in theory be able to get the benefit of the refund from the Commonwealth as a windfall gain. Refund legislation introduced by the Government earlier in this sitting sought to ensure, according to the Government, that any refunds paid by the Commonwealth went to those people who actually bore the tax, rather than to the builders who paid the tax to the Commonwealth but then passed it on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That legislation imposed a condition on the eligibility of the pool builder to a refund by requiring that where the sales tax impost was passed on to the customer the refund must also be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also provided that pool builders be paid interest for the period that they were out of pocket as a result of the High Court decision, although it contained no such consideration for the pool owners and did not even begin to repay the costs incurred by pool builders as a result of their legal ordeal with the Tax Office. The coalition supported the idea of refunding pool owners and builders for payments they had made to the Tax Office under what turned out to be an illegal sales tax impost. Unfortunately, the refund legislation that was subsequently passed by this Parliament does not even begin to bring about that result. In fact, it achieved the very opposite outcome, enabling the Tax Office to keep the money, including the trust fund moneys handed over in good faith by the Swimming Pool and Spa Association. Furthermore, it would appear that this had been the intention of the Government and the ATO in this matter all along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the High Court decision, there had been considerable confusion about the mechanism by which the Government would be able to refund swimming pool owners. On 31 March this year, the Tax Commissioner issued a press release in which he referred to some of these difficulties. In that release he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision has raised a range of complex legal issues surrounding the questions of how and under what conditions money which has been paid as sales tax by professional and private pool builders can be refunded. These issues must be clarified before any decision on the payment of refunds can be made.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the subsequent refund legislation did not even attempt to address the problems created by the High Court decision. Instead, what we got was the bottom of the pool scandal, whereby the Tax Office sought to misappropriate the funds that rightfully belonged to those swimming pool owners and builders who in many cases bore the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Koch, money guide writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, has aptly described the bottom of the pool scandal as `an intriguing litany of secret deals and fights'. It sounds typical of Labor in government in Canberra and in general, does it not, Mr Deputy Speaker? That aside, one of the problems with the first attempt at refund legislation was that the Commonwealth is liable to make a refund of tax paid only if the Commissioner of Taxation receives a declaration from the pool builder that the amount paid was not passed on to the pool purchaser or, if an amount was passed on, that amount has been refunded to the pool purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious problem with that provision, however, is that it relies on the pool builders to make the necessary declaration, something which they have absolutely no incentive to do if the proceeds of a claim are not theirs to keep. As well, the pool builders must sign a declaration, subject to severe penalties for misstatement, that either no sales tax was passed on, or that sales tax has already been refunded to the owner if the pool builder is to get a refund. But most pools have been installed under the lump sum contracts which do not make identifiable provision for the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pool building is a very competitive industry, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and has been made even more so due to the widespread tax avoidance that took place under the illegal sales tax problems in 1986. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many pool builders wore the tax out of their profit margins rather than passing it on to consumers, or they only passed it on in part, and so there is often no accounting for sales tax either paid or not paid by the pool builder. Also, there is absolutely no incentive for the pool builder to make such a declaration since the total value of the refund goes to the pool owner and the builder is stuck with the administration costs. There is no compensation to the builder for the time and expense involved in preparing and lodging such declarations, processing the refunds and substantiating claims in the event of an audit by the ATO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pool builder would probably have to borrow at commercial rates in order to refund a pool owner until the refund from the Tax Office came along, something which just does not make business sense when the Tax Office is only paying around 14 per cent interest on overpaid tax, which is itself then subject to income tax. The Bill leaves pool owners, who may have borne the tax, without any recourse if the pool builder refuses to process a declaration which, as I have made clear, he has every incentive not to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also no recourse for the pool owner if the pool builder has since gone out of business, and many pool builders have due to the effects of the recession we `had to have' on a fiercely competitive industry. It would be impossible for these pool owners to obtain a refund, even if the pool builder were available and willing to process the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of far greater importance perhaps than the lack of incentives for builders to process refunds is the fact that the refund legislation served to nullify the agreement between the Swimming Pool and Spa Association and the Australian Taxation Office for the refund of moneys collected illegally by the Tax Office. While this was not expressly provided for in the Bill, it was the effect of the drafting of the relevant clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In collusion with its Labor masters, the ATO ratted on its agreement with the Association and sought to retrospectively deprive builders of their rights under the agreement to a refund of the moneys illegally collected by the Tax Office. Not only is this a great injustice to pool builders who handed over the money in good faith to the Australian Taxation Office; it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent for the administration of taxation law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreements between the ATO and taxpayers are an important part of the functioning of the Australian taxation system. They are a regular feature of relations between taxpayers and the ATO. By nullifying the agreement between the Tax Office and the Association, it is the first time that the ATO has reneged on such a major agreement with taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers will never again be able to trust a Tax Office agreement, to the great detriment of the administration of taxation law in this country. If businesses cannot trust the Tax Office to live up to agreements that it has made with them as taxpayers, then they have little choice but to pay tax on demand and possibly sometimes go out of business as a result. The reality behind these measures was admirably described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Mr David Koch when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the Treasurer and the Tax Office have pulled a swifty on everyone. They have broken an agreement with the builders, won political points for giving the refund to the owners but made it so hard to claim that the Tax Office will end up keeping the money.</PARA>
<PARA>That is about the size of it, is it not? That is a measure of the integrity with which the Australian taxation system is administered by Labor. It should be remembered that, the day after we first debated the refund legislation in this House, Mr Justice Spender of the Federal Court in Brisbane said in a judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commissioner were an ordinary citizen, it would, in my view, be unconscionable for him now to decline to do which he promised to do in 1990. Questions of unconscionability, estoppel and breach of warranty of authority . . . would be relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>The solicitor for one of the major pool building companies was even more damning in the evidence he gave to the Senate Select Committee that gave consideration to the refund legislation. In evidence, Mr Winter had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is the product of the most disgracefully dishonest or deceitful conduct by the Australian Taxation Office that I have witnessed in acting for and against government agencies in all my years of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that the conduct is more disgraceful because the deceitful activities of the Australian Taxation Office have apparently been systematic rather than isolated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the background to this legislation. As I said at the outset, this debacle is typical of several such disasters that have characterised Labor's administration of the wholesale sales tax system in the course of this Parliament alone. That Labor continues to inflict this iniquitous, burdensome and inefficient wholesale sales tax on the Australian people is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill will alter the imposition of sales tax in three principal areas: firstly, it provides the introduction of sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ; secondly, it grants a 12-month extension of the sales tax exemption on ultra high frequency transmitters; and, finally, it makes several minor amendments to the sales tax laws to ensure that they operate in the manner originally intended by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that previous legislation which sought to impose a sales tax on swimming pools was ruled of no effect by the High Court earlier this year. This led to the inequitable situation where prefabricated pools were subject to the wholesale sales tax while pools constructed in situ were not. This legislation addresses this inconsistency by reimposing sales tax on swimming pools, spas and hot tub shells that are constructed in situ. A pool builder will be liable for sales tax immediately after a pool is constructed if the contract was entered into on or after 1 January 1993 or, in the case of an owner-builder, if the shell was commenced on or after 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the further extension of the exemption from sales tax of ultra high frequency transmitters until 1 January 1993, this legislation also includes several other minor amendments. These changes are not intended to raise additional revenue but are rather intended to make sure the sales tax operates in the manner intended by the Government. Raising revenue is essential if governments are to be able to provide the many services that they currently offer to the community. While every tax system has its faults, the one thing that governments must aim to do is to ensure that a tax is fair and equitable. A fair and equitable tax system has been a very important part of this Government's reforms, and will continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have spent a great deal of time recently trying to undermine the wholesale sales tax as being imperfect. The present sales tax system may not be perfect, but the GST&mdash;the goods and services tax, the consumption tax; call it what you like&mdash;that is being proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is not just imperfect, it is also rather unfair. It is important that we have a taxation system&mdash;it is essential that we have  a  taxation system&mdash;that  is  fair  and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to understand how a goods and services tax is unjust, it is important to comprehend the advantages that the wholesale sales tax has over the goods and services tax. Since its introduction by the Scullin Government 62 years ago, the tax has been changed significantly to give effect to the various government policies, including measures to prevent double taxation of goods. The wholesale sales tax is a useful way of taxing a variety of goods at the point of wholesale as distinct from the retail point of sale. The wholesale sales tax is a single stage tax on goods manufactured in, or imported into, Australia for consumption in Australia. It applies only to goods; it is not restricted purely to the sale of goods, with the leasing of goods or the private use of goods by the wholesaler also being covered by the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax does not apply to the basic necessities of life, such as basic foodstuffs that would be covered by the Leader of the Opposition's goods and services tax. It does not apply to most services, such as fresh food, houses and buildings, goods manufactured primarily from recycled materials, second-hand goods, and goods that are exported from Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the sales tax which is being reapplied here it is important also to talk about the case which actually took the sales tax away in the first place. That challenge has been referred to by previous speakers. When talking about sales tax, it is very difficult not to broaden the aspect a fair bit. But I will try to restrict my remarks in order to accommodate those honourable members opposite. We have limited time to debate this legislation. I know that the honourable member for McPherson wants to make a few comments and I do not want to take up too much of his time. I believe in fair play in this place, but that does not always seem to apply to those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot talk about sales tax without referring to some of the things which are being put around the community at the moment about the difference between a sales tax, which has been applied to the swimming pools referred to in this legislation, and what those opposite would propose with a goods and services or consumption tax. There are great strengths in a wholesale sales tax in that it allows some goods to be taxed at a lower rate than others. People pay less for the necessities of life than they would under a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The item we are talking about today&mdash;swimming pools&mdash;would be considered by many to be a luxury item; it certainly is in my community. Luxury items are generally taxed more heavily than other items and this ensures a fair degree of equity in the tax system. We talked earlier about an equitable tax system and this Government is very much committed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another advantage of the wholesale sales tax system is the low cost of collection and administration. That is important because it is a tax which is applied at the wholesale level. Contrary to some of the propaganda of the Opposition and the untruths which are peddled around the community, the costs associated with the wholesale sales tax are relatively low&mdash;only some 0.5 per cent of the revenue collected. That contrasts quite distinctly with the goods and services tax if it is to apply. Despite what those opposite would have us believe, a consumption tax on swimming pools would be quite regressive for the builders who would have to collect that goods and services tax on those pools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am still going. The Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill 1992 is very important legislation. It is a very grave matter that we now have three minutes left in which to debate this legislation seriously. I am not even sure that it is worth making a serious attempt to do it. But it is important from my point of view. As the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) observed, I have probably as many swimming pools in my electorate as I have constituents. I have been involved in this matter since day one, and in this legislation today we have just another step in the whole sorry saga of government mismanagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which this legislation has been approached is really a joke. We now have another attempt to patch up the wholesale sales tax system. The honourable member for Oxley tried to argue that there was some merit in the wholesale sales tax system. If ever we needed to look to just one place to see why the wholesale sales tax does not work, we have only to look to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lengths to which the Government has gone to try to make it work are quite ridiculous. In order to actually levy the tax on an owner-builder the tax has to be defined in terms of a comparable in-ground fibreglass pool shell sold at a wholesale price. The Sales Tax Assessment Act, from start to finish, is trying to make the wholesale sales tax work in a situation where it does not work. The net effect of a value added tax in respect of this matter is that it will be fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge to the honourable member for Oxley that the net effect of a GST or value added tax on the final price of a swimming pool will not be vastly different from what it is now. It will be around the same price. But the way in which the tax will be levied in respect of an in-ground swimming pool will be much fairer and more equitable. The problems which the legislation goes to great lengths to try to solve&mdash;that is, whether the pool is built by a pool builder or an owner-builder&mdash;do not exist with a value added tax. It is a very simple and straightforward mechanism for the collection of that tax. So the honourable member cannot argue in the context of this legislation or any other that a wholesale sales tax is better than a goods and services or value added tax. It is not better in this case and it is not better in any other case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is supported by the pool industry. There has been consultation and the industry is as amazed as anybody that the Government has actually listened to it. So we have here legislation which reflects the pool builders' wish that the whole industry be treated equally and fairly. In-ground pools will be taxed in the same way as fibreglass pools and the problem we had formerly with owner-builders avoiding the tax will be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the result of this legislation is nevertheless second best. We must ask the question: why do we tax swimming pools at all? The implication of imposing a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax is that somehow these are luxury items. I put it to the House today that for many people in this country swimming pools are not luxuries. They might be luxuries for people who live in Melbourne; but speaking on behalf of Queenslanders and people who live in hot climates and the remote areas of Australia, swimming pools are almost as essential as refrigerators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose this question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, in case he gets a chance to sum up: why does the Government not tax tennis courts? There is no wholesale sales tax on tennis courts construction. There is no wholesale sales tax on landscaping. Why pick on swimming pools? The other thing I would like to say in the 10 seconds that I have left is that this legislation is an attack by this Government on small business. The way the Government expects pool builders to collect this tax is an absolute disgrace, and I hope it loses the High Court action that it is taking against Mutual Pools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill is designed to implement the measure announced in the 1992-93 Budget to tax certain car parking benefits that are received by employees from their employers. The Bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 by imposing the fringe benefits tax on these car parking benefits conferred on employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These benefits are said to arise only where a car used to commute from home to work is parked at or near the employee's main workplace for more than four hours between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. If the employer reimburses the employee's car parking expenses, the value of the benefit will be the amount of the reimbursement. If the employer provides car parking facilities to an employee, the value of the benefit will be determined in accordance with the mechanism that is perhaps the most controversial part of this Bill. It specifies that the value of the fringe benefit will be the value of the lowest cost all-day parking available at a permanent commercial parking station for the public's use which is within one kilometre of the employer provided facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the Income Tax Assessment Act to deny employees a deduction for similar car parking expenses which arise from parking a car used to commute to work at or near the employee's main workplace for more than four hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The removal of the deduction is designed to ensure that the overall tax effect of providing either a car parking benefit or an allowance to an employee to cover his or her car parking expenses is substantially the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation of the many unintended consequences that this legislation can be expected to have, the legislation provides that the provision of certain car parking facilities can be exempted by regulation. These exemptions may include parking facilities provided by employers that are of a minimum value or parking facilities which would not normally be considered commercial parking stations for the purposes of the legislation. It is expected that these measures will raise an additional $90m in 1993-94, $253m in 1994-95 and $203m in subsequent years. The provisions of the Bill will come into force on 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that this new tax measure has been badly received by employers and their employees would be something of an understatement. The cause of this bad reception is not just the additional tax burden that the tax will impose on business, although that is obviously one of the main objections. The problem that most businesses have with this tax is that it is simply unworkable, given the way in which it has been designed by the Australian Taxation Office and embodied in the legislation. Mr Stephen Harrison, the Executive Director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole basis of the tax is so ridiculous it is hard to believe the Government's proposals are serious.</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute of Chartered Accountants has gone so far as to call this a Monty Python tax because it will see employers walking around the city streets with measuring wheels, trying to calculate the distance between their offices and the nearest parking station. Can you imagine it? It is the one-kilometre proximity test that is of special concern. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed method of determining liability for this tax is clearly unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Businesses and the Tax Office have enough trouble with our current fringe benefits tax laws without having to cope with ridiculous new rules which will see business owners trudging around the city streets with measuring wheels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea is so comical it is hard to believe that the Government fully understands the implications of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will require employers to carry out a number of burdensome compliance measures at their own expense in order to meet the requirements in this legislation. Firstly, employers will have to actually measure the distance between their office and the nearest commercial car park. They will then have to continually monitor car park developments in the area of their office or workplace to determine whether they thereby incur a fringe benefits tax liability as a result of a new parking space or facilities becoming available. Such an event would give rise to unwanted and unplanned for fringe benefits tax liability, which for the marginal firm could be a financial disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia has pointed out that large, regionally based employers may be subject to economic ransom by unscrupulous operators who may seek to gain advantage by establishing backyard stations nearby. One does not have to have much imagination to know what I am talking about. The proposal to deal with these problems by means of regulation is a totally inadequate solution to problems that might arise. Businesses will also have to monitor the regular and severe price wars between car parking stations so that the lowest all-day car parking rate can be ascertained to minimise the subsequent fringe benefits tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of a business that has only a premium parking station within the one-kilometre radius is particularly onerous and discriminatory. For example, commercial car parks in suburban areas are often located in shopping centres where the parking tariffs are structured to discourage long term parking. This may result in the all-day rate being as high as $20, which will be more expensive than many city car parks, even though the benefit to the employee will be worth much less than that obtained from a central business district parking place. There is also a potentially enormous compliance cost associated with keeping records to meet the requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is a self-assessing tax, and that should not be forgotten. Employers will be required to maintain records of parking benefits provided, calculate the value of those benefits and assess the tax payable on those values. Fringe benefits tax returns must be remitted annually, and employers must pay quarterly fringe benefit tax instalments in anticipation of each year's liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation employers will need to keep records of car parking bays made available and the use or uses to which they are put. They will need to keep records of the lowest fee charged by the commercial parking stations within one kilometre of their own parking facilities, which is something that changes all the time. They will need to keep records of payment of reimbursements of parking expenses incurred by their employees. They will also need to keep records of whether such parking expenses qualify for concessional treatment as either `otherwise deductible' to an employee exclusively incurred in producing the employee's salary or wages or subject to a contribution made by the employee reducing the taxable value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time and expense involved in meeting these record keeping and other requirements is probably far more burdensome and onerous in many cases than the actual amount of tax which will be payable. The Taxation Institute of Australia has also observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposed legislation is more onerous than the initial motor vehicle fringe benefits provision and the record keeping requirements are greater and will be extremely difficult to administer in their current form.</PARA>
<PARA>All this must have been what the Government was talking about when it mentioned that the new tax measures contained in the Budget and its tax policy statement would result in additional but unquantified compliance costs. You can say that again!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this legislation essentially unworkable; it is potentially highly inequitable in its application. The intention of the legislation is clearly to tax those highly paid executives who receive valuable car parking benefits from their employer without having to pay tax on those benefits, while many other employees must pay for their use of car parking facilities out of their after tax income. That is the clear intention, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this might have been the original intention of the legislation, or at least the official rationale for its introduction, it has little in common with what will be the actual impact of the Bill. The amount of revenue that Labor anticipates raising from this tax and as a result of changes to the valuation of the fringe benefits tax base strongly suggests that this car parking tax will have a much wider impact than Labor's usual spiteful anti-business rhetoric would have one believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new method of calculating fringe benefits tax treats fringe benefits in the same way as cash for company tax purposes by effectively raising the fringe benefits tax to the same level as the top marginal tax rate. This means that employers who do not pay company tax at the rate of 39 per cent will not have the same fringe benefits tax offsets available to them as do many businesses, perhaps businesses with which they are in competition. These employers, other than those in business, include schools, universities, hospitals, various government bodies and any other organisations that one might care to name that commonly provide parking to its employees. So while the effective fringe benefits tax rate for business will rise by a considerable 9c in the dollar, there will be a massive increase in the fringe benefits tax burden faced by these other employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, the fringe benefits tax rate will double. The impact on tax exempt bodies will be particularly severe, since they do not get a tax benefit for the fringe benefits tax paid. A tax exempt body that currently faces no costs in relation to providing parking to its employees and which has available $10 lowest cost parking within a kilometre will incur a fringe benefits tax liability from 1 April 1993 of $5 and a $9 liability following the change to the fringe benefits tax valuation law from 1 April 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment consequences of this measure, particularly with the high levels of unemployment prevailing at the moment in the recession we had to have, are most unwelcome. This tax will hit many employers of blue collar workers in factories, airports and the like that provide off-street parking to their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the tax bears absolutely no relation to the value of the car parking space to the employee and is based solely on the cost of commercial car parking available within a one-kilometre radius. This will give rise to a number of distortions and absurdities. For example, the relevant commercial car parking station may provide a facility that is of a higher standard than that provided by an employer, so that there is no real relationship between the amount charged by the commercial parking station and the value of the benefit provided by the employer in his workplace to his employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial parking station may provide under cover security parking, complete with valet and other services, perhaps, and it will set higher prices accordingly. At the same time, an employer within one kilometre of such a facility may simply allow his employees to park on open vacant land or on the premises, yet under this legislation, it is assumed that the employee receives a benefit equal to the charge applied by the commercial parking station with the valet services, a far superior quality of parking. Of course, the reverse could also be true. Employees may be receiving the benefit of high quality car parking facilities from their employer and, yet, the employer may only pay fringe benefits tax according to the charges set by a nearby poor quality parking facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will not just hit employers in central business districts. As already indicated, many car parking stations have been built in inner and outer suburbs, so many employers outside the CBDs will be hit for fringe benefits tax on their employee parking. At the same time, the tax may force some employers out of a CBD into the suburbs to avoid the high rates charged by central business district parking stations, and possibly to avoid local parking stations and FBT altogether. Obviously, this would be contrary to the many other urban planning policies, State and Federal, which try to encourage commuters to use public transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well established that people who work outside central business districts are far more likely to use their cars to get to work. It is also possible that this measure will further exacerbate the downturn in central business district commercial property values that has occurred in recent years, as employers seek to escape the tax-heavy CBD areas of our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why this legislation may prove to be particularly burdensome is that many employers have been required by local planning laws to make provision for parking for their employees. Having incurred these additional costs required by local planning laws, these employers are now faced with an additional fringe benefits tax liability as some sort of negative reward, as it were. It is in these ways that the fringe benefits tax on car parking facilities becomes yet another tax on jobs. It increases the tax penalties for employers taking on more employees at a time when we need employment promoting policies and an employment promoting tax system such as proposed by the coalition in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation exposes the hypocrisy of Labor's attack on the equity of the coalition's tax reform proposals by demonstrating its willingness to slug blue collar and other workers with new taxes and at higher rates than those applicable to the employers of senior executives when it suits Labor's money-grubbing purposes. There are many other mechanisms available by which Labor could have sought to tax the fringe benefits of senior executives in receipt of unduly generous fringe benefits of this type, if it were of such a mind. The most obvious of these would be to levy the tax as a percentage of the salaries of those provided with free car parking by their employers. The Taxation Institute has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that the proposed legislation should permit employers to calculate the value of the benefit on an actual basis, as an alternative to the method currently specified.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the method specified in the Bill. It is not clear why this or many other possible approaches have not been adopted, but one suspects that it has more than a little to do with how much revenue could be raised through the various options that were available to Labor to tax the car parking benefits of employees. There is a lot more revenue to be had through slugging a wide range of blue collar and other workers than in targeting the relatively small numbers of well paid executives who are the ostensible target of this legislation. That is the only conclusion that can be reached from Labor's revenue projections associated with this legislation, projections that will be blown out considerably by the change in the fringe benefits tax valuation base that is to follow a year later. </PARA>

In the United States, parking benefits are assessable, but deductions are allowed if incurred in business or employment related activity. In Germany, employer provided parking is exempt from any such tax. In Holland, employer provided parking is exempt if owned by the employer and where the employer rents the parking a benefit is then assessed. Generally, these countries do not recognise a benefit in employer provided parking and do not raise a tax liability on it. The conclusion of the Taxation Institute of Australia is:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to be as brief as I can, because my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) also wants to contribute to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill 1992 this morning or perhaps this afternoon. I want to respond to a few comments made by the Opposition spokesman on this issue, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). He claims that this measure, which attempts to place a fringe benefits tax on car parking spaces provided by employers mainly within central business districts, is an example of Labor's usual, spiteful, anti-business rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This alleged usual, spiteful, anti-business rhetoric is, of course, the fringe benefits tax. It is a tax which the Government introduced after the Tax Summit in 1985. We believed that it made the tax system fairer. We believed that it was wrong and unfair that people on usually very high incomes were receiving benefits from their employers for overseas holidays, luxury company cars, private school fees for the children of the employees&mdash;as people in the gallery would know, it was not people on average wages who were getting these free holidays and BMW cars provided by the boss, it was usually people on very high incomes&mdash;and were getting those benefits from the employer tax free, when ordinary wage and salary earners were having to pay tax on all of their income. That is why we have a fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition today is taking a more responsible attitude to the fringe benefits tax than it took in 1986, because in those days when the Government introduced fringe benefits tax the Opposition totally opposed it. The Opposition said it was wrong that employers should have to pay a tax on these fringe benefits. There is now a bipartisan attitude to this issue that the fringe benefits tax should apply to people who get these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether extending fringe benefits tax to car parking is a good or a bad measure. The Opposition has outlined its case as to why it considers this to be an example of Labor's usual, spiteful, anti-business rhetoric. The only problem for the Opposition is that I, like the member for North Sydney, come from New South Wales. In New South Wales we have a Liberal government&mdash;which could not be accused of having Labor's usual, spiteful, anti-business rhetoric&mdash;which has introduced an annual $200 a year levy or a tax on all car spaces within the Sydney and, I think, the North Sydney local government areas. This is an example where a Liberal government at the State level believes that it is in the public interest to ensure that perhaps there is an incentive for people to leave their cars at home and use public transport or, in addition, that perhaps those people who provide the car spaces and who encourage people to drive into the central business districts contribute towards the upkeep of traffic lights, roads and all those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic question is one of fairness. Will this measure seek to ensure that those people who get a benefit are paying their fair share of tax and are treated in the same way as the great majority of wage and salary earners?  It is my view that this measure does introduce an improvement in fairness. If any people in the chamber have ever tried to park their car in a commercial car park in Sydney, they would know that they have to drive up four or five storeys before they can find a car parking space which a member of the public can use. The car parking stations sell reserved spaces to employers who provide them to their employees for $2,500 to $3,000 a year. That is a benefit that those employees are getting from their employers tax free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone else, who works in the company but who does not get the annual parking space provided by the employer, wishes to park his or her car at the same parking station, he or she has to pay $2,500 to $3,000 a year out of his or her own after tax income. There is a great difference between the executive, who gets that car space provided by the employer, and the employee who uses his after tax income to try to secure parking at the same commercial car park. Once we recognise that that is a benefit in a commercial car park which should be subject to FBT, it follows that we also have to extend that same FBT to a car parking space which is on the premises of a company. Otherwise, we could have the ridiculous situation where employers who purchased the annual car parking space in a car parking station are taxed, but in the office block next door the car parking would not be subject to FBT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that this measure does seek to improve the fairness of the tax system and does seek to ensure that the companies, whose employees are getting this benefit tax free, are subject to fringe benefits tax. When this measure was first proposed I looked at the possibility of whether this tax could be limited to specific areas. I know there are some people in the chamber who believe that it should be limited only to the high-rise central business districts around Australia. The reason why that cannot be done is that the Constitution prohibits location specific measures in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has made a number of rulings on this issue. One is not able to pass a law which says that a tax applies only in a particular location. The tax has to treat all locations specifically. </PARA>

The fact that there might be some legislation currently on the statute which is area specific does not guarantee that all measures which might be proposed would withstand High Court challenges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to respond to a couple of inaccuracies in the contribution of the shadow Minister. He claimed that public hospitals would have to pay this tax. That is not true. Public hospitals, as public beneficial institutions, are exempt from fringe benefits tax, so we will not see public hospitals having to pay FBT on the parking spaces provided to their nurses or doctors. Private hospitals will be subject to FBT. Since they operate to make a profit, they should be treated in the same manner as other companies that seek to make a profit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the concept of removing subsidies from parking has to be supported on both equity grounds and traffic grounds. Parking has always been the main determinant of traffic. The subsidies for parking spaces in inner urban areas are one of the main reasons for traffic congestion in those areas. Legislation such as the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill has the potential to dramatically reduce the use of private cars in peak hours in inner Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of providing for the use of cars in the inner city are very substantially detracting from many other good uses which that money could be put to, both for Australia's road system generally and for many other activities. Most people are not aware of the enormous subsidies that we are providing. One example is the two-lane Cullerin bypass on the Hume Highway, which is worth about $6m a kilometre. The recent construction of the Gore Hill Freeway link cost $43m a kilometre. The construction of the tunnel cost, in effect, $1 billion a kilometre. This is the massive extent of subsidy that we are giving to the car driver in inner cities, which is detracting from all the other good uses of funds around Australia. In principle, I think this Bill has to be supported both on equity grounds and on traffic grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has pointed out, there are very serious problems with this measure. The heart of the problem is how to determine valuations of car parking spaces. I appreciate the efforts the Taxation Office has made to relate it to the use of commercial car parks, but, judging by all of the objections that have been advanced, this has already raised a number of distortions and inequities in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see that in my own electorate it will even start to determine where people locate their offices, because in Neutral Bay people will pay no fringe benefits tax but in Crows Nest they will pay it. We will create a race of consultants who will go around determining where people should locate their offices in order to avoid this tax. It will have a very dramatic effect on local government, because it is the main supplier of commercial car parks, probably because they are all subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some scope for flexibility in the Bill, but that in turn will raise a whole range of objections and problems. I am worried that, because we have this difficulty in determining the valuations in a manner which will not create distortions, the Bill will fail, either in the Senate or elsewhere. The principles of it are extremely good and should be pursued. I am very pleased to see that it will overcome the problem of the Commonwealth Government's subsidy of the $200 per car space tax in New South Wales. As things stood, the Commonwealth would have been providing $78 of that tax to the New South Wales Government. I am also very pleased to see that it will apply across the board; that it will apply to government bodies&mdash;local and State&mdash;as well as to private enterprise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to address an anomaly regarding the nursing home benefit payments scheme. This scheme is based on cost reimbursement; that is, funds are advanced by the Government during the year to owners of nursing homes to help with costs of patients and their maintenance. At the end of the year, where the owner has spent less on providing nursing home care than the Government advanced, the amount of unspent or overadvanced funding must be repaid. However, the money is not legally characterised as recoverable debt or entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This idiosyncrasy in the principal Act means that such amounts can be recovered only by fee loadings and not as debts. Thus proprietors who accrue a liability to the Commonwealth for overadvanced funding and then sell their nursing homes cannot be pursued for that overadvanced funding following the sale. However, the new proprietor is required to repay the amount from his fees, irrespective of the earlier amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to change the system so that the person who accrues the liability can be pursued for the money. Overadvanced benefits will be legally characterised as a debt recoverable through the courts. This amendment is welcomed by the coalition and the industry, but there is some concern that the Bill changes the system only prospectively. Many nursing homes around the country have suddenly found themselves liable for huge debts&mdash;sums of $250,000, $300,000, $150,000 and $96,000. The Government says that services rendered several years ago by the home, often under earlier management of a different proprietor, cannot be proven, yet those debts are effectively part of the new contingent liabilities of the new owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overadvanced Commonwealth funds are now being clawed back. The Government is only now carrying out across-the-board assessments to see whether money advanced to nursing homes as far back as 1986-87 can be substantiated by receipts. If so, hopefully the funds will be regained. The Government should have been doing these assessments every year. Surely taxpayers are entitled to know that the Government of the day is monitoring how it is spending their money. Similarly, nursing home owners could then continue their operations for the next year with full knowledge of their financial situations, commitments and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two examples of the problems caused by the Government's policy to date. The first is a nursing home operated by the Association of the Blind in Western Australia. It has recently been presented with a bill for $250,000 for overadvanced benefits dating back to 1985. The money is being clawed back at the rate of $5,000 per month. As a result, the nursing home is operating at a loss and is facing possible closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is a nursing home in Sydney which was purchased last year. The new owner is now being hit with a bill of close to $150,000. She was not advised by either the previous owner or the Department of the possibility of this additional debt. The Commonwealth is reducing the daily per patient subsidy until it reclaims the $150,000. The owner is therefore taking legal action against the Government, but in the meantime has to maintain an adequate standard of services to the patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment in the Bill addresses the problem of disclosure of debt when the nursing home is sold. The amendment requires that an owner has to identify outstanding overpayments and fee loadings prior to the sale of a home. The owner also has to disclose this financial information to prospective purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be able to recover overpayments at the point of sale and from the proceeds of the sale. Owners will be required to give notice of sale to the Government and will be deterred from completing the sale within 90 days of giving notice. Purchasers will also be required to give notice of their intent. The period of notice under the legislation will enable the vendor's claims, books and records to be scrutinised so that a fair estimate may be made of any overpayment and any anticipated fee loading which could relate to the period until sale. Prior to the sale, the purchaser will be required to pay from the purchase price the amount of the estimated overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are intended to afford greater protection of the rights of the Government to money owed to it, and the rights of purchasers to information about the nursing home they are buying and to a home unencumbered by liabilities accrued by the previous owner. Although the industry says the proposals should be retrospective, the Government has chosen not to go down this path, presumably because it thinks that it is up to the current owners to take action against previous owners for non-disclosure of debt. However, I would like to point out that the owners of nursing homes are often small business people and would not be able to afford the significant costs of legal recovery action. Nevertheless, the protection in the Bill for future buyers is welcomed by the Opposition. The changes are sensible and will avoid recurrence of examples I have already related. The Opposition will support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government welcomes the Opposition's support for the National Health Amendment Bill. It is an important piece of legislation which shows very clearly, I believe, to those who might be listening to this debate and to those who are interested in this particular area, that there is an important role for government in the oversight and scrutiny of the practices that occur in our community. Nursing home proprietors receive Commonwealth benefits in advance during the year. These benefits are applied to the running of the nursing home and to make sure that the people who are residents of the nursing homes have sufficient and adequate care and attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case under the present structure that at the end of the year the costs that are actually incurred are acquitted against the money that has been advanced. It is very often the case that there has been an overpayment to a nursing home. As a result of that, there is a requirement&mdash;an obligation, as I believe most people would agree&mdash;for that money to be repaid. Under the present structure that money is repaid according to a negative fee loadings system by which, during the subsequent year, the fees of the nursing home are varied according to the previous overpayment. This particular structure provides some problems, and it is by a legislative quirk that it is the case that such debts, which all of us would see as debts, are not recoverable as debts; they are not legally characterised as debts. So it is not possible for somebody who purchases a nursing home, and finds that the circumstances are such that debts have been accrued, to take action through the court to collect what might be seen by most people as a debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case in the sale of nursing homes&mdash;and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) outlined a couple of cases&mdash;that these circumstances have prevailed. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), in a press release in August of last year, suggested that there needed to be original proprietor liability which meant that the new purchaser should not hold liability for any debts that had been accrued by a previous owner. The entitlement to the benefit unfortunately did not crystallise until the Commonwealth was able to determine what was owed by means of an audit. It was the delay process, or the time to determine the debt, that caused such problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money was paid in advance, but there were no means whereby this could be determined as a recoverable debt legally. What will happen in the new provisions is that this money will be paid in advance on a provisional basis. Once the actual expenditure is determined it will be possible for the Commonwealth to recover the debt by law. What we are seeing here is a change in the way in which nursing home funding is administered. It is a change which is brought about by legislative fiat, and it is something that is the job of this Parliament; it is the mechanism of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is at present coming into this place and flying around the country suggesting that government does not have a place, suggesting that we need less and less government in this nation. But we find, rather paradoxically in respect of this legislation and many pieces of legislation that come into this House, that it accepts the necessity for us to legislate to oversee such practices as the provision of services by the Commonwealth in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an inconsistency in the position that is put by those opposite because in many areas they are suggesting we need less government when the empirical and theoretical evidence would indicate that this would lead to huge cost blow-outs. It is inconsistent on the part of those opposite to come into the House and to say how they are looking for efficiency and how they believe we can save money by getting out of the business of government yet, at the same time, in many cases saying that they understand there is a role for government, that it is an important role and something they support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many examples, as I have said, of nursing home benefits provided by the Commonwealth being used by proprietors for purposes other than the support of residents. When the nursing home is sold the difficulty arises for the new purchaser. Many of course would say that this is the classical case of caveat emptor: let the buyer beware. If the buyer is disappointed with his purchase then the responsibility lies with him. But the particular circumstances of nursing homes, the way in which they are funded and the constitutional responsibility of government require that our first consideration should be the care and attention given to those frail aged people who are resident in nursing homes. Our second consideration must surely go to the taxpayers who provide the funding which is so important to the provision of adequate frail aged care and care in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in autumn last year that we required the disclosure of relevant information for purchasers. That change to the legislation enabled prospective purchasers to obtain from the Commonwealth information about the status of nursing homes and the particular position of a nursing home before they purchased. Unfortunately, that still did not go far enough. In this legislation we require notice of sale to be part of the sale process of a nursing home. This will require a period of about 90 days during which it will be possible for the prospective purchaser of a nursing home to find out exactly what is going on, what the details are and who owes money to whom. As I have indicated, there have been many cases where this has not been adequately pursued. We are hopeful that the requirements for notice of sale will bring about changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements of the sale will have to take into account all of the details which relate to a particular nursing home and all overpayments and all debts owed by the nursing home prior to the sale taking place. The person who accrues the debt will be required to pay it. It will protect taxpayers' money which is applied to this very important purpose of providing care for the residents of nursing homes. It will, of course, protect the rights of purchasers. For those who work or who are involved in the nursing home industry and involved in buying and selling, it will clarify the situation significantly. For those who work in nursing homes and who are residents in nursing homes, it will be an important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that there is a debate in this country about what role the Commonwealth should have in respect of health care, aged care, pensions and a large number of such issues. Last night the Opposition spokesman on health care, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), suggested in this place, in very dulcet tones&mdash;quietly, meekly&mdash;that one of the great dilemmas in our health care system related to waiting lists for hospitals and that these had not previously been a problem. Had I been in the House&mdash;unfortunately, I was in my room&mdash;I might have said to him that, when I was a resident medical officer working at a large general hospital in Perth in the late 1970s, it was very clear to me that one of my responsibilities was the management of waiting lists for elective surgery. The waiting lists went for some months&mdash;some for as long as six months or a year. So it is the case that waiting lists have always been a method used to efficiently run hospitals and utilise the resources applied to health care; waiting lists have been a part of our structure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely! There would not be a system anywhere in the world which would have it any other way. If I have a car repair business and my mechanics are sitting around with nothing to do for a lot of the time, that is a very inefficient way to use my resources. If I can have a constant flow of work for them, that would be a much more efficient use of resources, of their capacities and abilities. Those opposite may not like the analogy but it applies in exactly the same way to filling hospital beds and using hospital resources and health resources efficiently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries have other systems. The problem with the shadow Minister is that he says that what we are doing is using waiting lists and Medicare to hold down costs and that the Opposition would remove all those and still hold down costs. Unfortunately, that would not happen. All of the empirical and theoretical evidence anywhere in the world suggests that that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to eliminate those waiting lists&mdash;and I think we probably could&mdash;we would have to spend twice as much on health care. That would have to come from either taxpayers or individuals paying massive premiums for private health insurance. If that is what those opposite want to do, they should stand up in this place and say so&mdash;and say so all over the country. But they should not come into this place and suggest that they can do twice as much and spend the same amount of money, because it is impossible unless the money that is presently applied is being hopelessly and inefficiently applied&mdash;and that is neither my experience nor, I believe, the experience of most practitioners in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most other countries do have systems whereby they ration the application of resources. In the United States they ration it by price. The things that we take for granted in this country as basic requirements for medical health care are not available to people in the United States unless they are very wealthy or very well insured by their employer. Indeed, health insurance is a cost to business. We have not heard those on the other side screaming about it yet, but it will become part of a condition of employment and it will be something that employers will be required to pay here. It is a cost to employers in other countries which have the sort of structure that those opposite are wanting to determine. They should consider that. In the United States they ration by price. There are 30 million people in the United States without adequate health care, and the most common cause of bankruptcy in the United States is ill health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom they have a different structure; essentially, they ration by time, as we do, but they also have limits. People over 65 years cannot get their hips replaced in the public system. It does not matter how bad it is, or what the circumstances are, they cannot get that done. Kidney dialysis machines are not available to people over 60 years. So the United Kingdom rations much more viciously than we do. If people fall outside those guidelines, then it is price that operates again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very compassionate system in this country, a system that works and rations according to time. It is not ideal. It would be better if everybody could be served immediately, but the costs of that are something that we cannot afford. Just as local budgets have to be managed, this Government has to manage the budget of this country. That is a consideration that really needs to be taken into account. Those opposite have come in here and said, `There is no role for government; market forces can work'. Unfortunately, in the area of health care and in the provision of these very important services, market forces do not operate in the same way as we would like them to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the area which is important here, the area which relates to how we will look after nursing homes. If we look at the sorts of things that the Opposition has said about aged care, the sorts of things that it is wanting to do, we find that there are lots of platitudes in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to ensure that the sick, the old and those genuinely in need receive the assistance they deserve but we want to put an end to the rorts and abuses of such assistance by people who can, and should, provide for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very laudable sentiments. I was here in 1984. We had an election at the end of that year, and the big issue&mdash;the thing that hurt the Labor Party, and I admit that it hurt the Labor Party&mdash;was the assets test on pensions. We said, `Okay, if you have $300,000 or $400,000, maybe you do not require the Government to pay you a pension every week. If you are a millionaire in this country, then maybe we cannot afford to pay you a pension every week'. We saw a most vicious campaign by the Opposition against the assets test, which was a fair and reasonable test by any account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we ask of the Government? What do we ask of legislators, and what do we expect of the people who come to the Parliament in that role? We expect them to be consistent in their arguments. We are seeing incredible inconsistency from the Opposition. We expect the people who make the laws in this country to have a sense of justice and fairness. It is not fair and just that those with very substantial means should have received the pension. It was a change that needed to be made, should have been made, and was made. My experience in this place is that, every time that sort of suggestion is made, we look for the political chance&mdash;we look for the puny motive. The assets test debate was a debate along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking for people who we think will legislate well for us, we look for people who understand that there needs to be efficiency and prudence in the way in which money is applied. That is clearly the case. The Opposition suggests in its policy that we need to put an end to the rorts and abuses of such assistance by people who can and should provide for themselves. We do not have any difficulty with that. We have been in this job now for nearly 10 years. One of the things we have tried to do is to make the system fairer, to make people accountable for the benefits they receive. We have done that in a substantial number of ways. We have tried to improve the taxation system so that there is a fair and just way of making people pay their responsible dues and pay what is fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we see the Opposition proposing&mdash;and, indeed, it is the central plank of its policy for the next election&mdash;a goods and services tax. It is a tax which will be applied across the board on food, clothing, housing costs and many other services. Going to the football, having a haircut, and going to the movies&mdash;all of these things&mdash;will be taxed; in particular, food and clothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the argument from the other side: `Well, lots of other countries have a goods and services tax'. Many countries do have a goods a services tax. I agree with that. But in almost all of those countries there is a differential rate for those things which are considered to be the necessities of life, those things which are believed to be essentials and important for everybody's ordinary everyday living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the case that the Opposition's proposal wraps up anything like that sense of fairness which has been captured by every other country which has a goods and services tax. We have across the board taxation, so a family of four with an income of $30,000 supposedly eats much less than a family of four with an income of $100,000. That is not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see about that in the not too distant future, I understand. These two Bills, after a period of 10 years, now purport to improve the anti-dumping arrangements in Australia, after all that time. I will say at the outset that there is absolutely no doubt that this Government, in the early stages of its career, viewed the people who took anti-dumping action or countervailing action against subsidisers as arch protectionists. There is no doubt in industry that that is the view of most people. It has led to a situation where&mdash;and those opposite will remember&mdash;the timeframes have been brought well back. At one stage we were facing a series of procedures which took between 300 and 400 days to get to some fruition in a decision about anti-dumping or about subsidising. That timeframe has been brought back by this Government&mdash;not far enough&mdash;to a total of 245 days. It is not short enough, and the same problem still exists in industry; that is, most people who wish to run an anti-dumping or a countervailing action against people who they feel have been cheating in the international market&mdash;in other words, exporting products from the country of origin at less than the normal value or the normal price&mdash;are put off by the fact that the timeframe and the cost of that timeframe are just too great. I will come back to that a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two Bills propose to amend the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988. The Government says that these Bills represent the final change in Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing provisions. This will not be the final change, because when the Government changes we will make significant other changes which, amongst other things, will change to some extent the material injury test and certainly the timeframes in which people can confidently expect a result and, more importantly, confidently expect an interim result, which is what really matters. The Government has said that this will be the last change. There will be more to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) said in his second reading speech, goods are said to be dumped if the export price of the product is less than the normal value; that is, the comparable price for the like product in the domestic market of the exporting company. Anti-dumping action can only be proven if it is established as a result of inquiries by Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority that goods have been dumped and that the dumping is causing or threatening material injury to the Australian industry. That is quite true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills change the manner in which duties are imposed and collected after one has been proven guilty, if you like. As was said in the Minister's second reading speech, the current legislation&mdash;those arrangements which are in place at the present time&mdash;imposes a dumping duty which represents the difference between the export price and the normal value of goods or, where the Minister directs, a lesser amount sufficient to remove the injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present regime the duty is not payable if a correction is made by raising the actual export price to the level of the normal value determined at the inquiry. That is seen to be a shortcoming, and we agree that it is a shortcoming. This after 10 years of the Labor Party being in government, and after probably seven or eight years&mdash;five at least&mdash;of the community saying to the Government time and time again that these anti-dumping procedures are just too long, that they are too onerous, that they are too expensive, that they do not work, and that even when we get an anti-dumping measure in place, which is what these Bills are about, all of a sudden we find that somebody makes an adjustment and they slip around the net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Government has chosen to bring in some measures which agree in substance with the sorts of anti-dumping and countervailing systems that are used in the EC and, in a general sense, in the USA. As I said, we do not disagree with the changes, but they have taken so long. Here we are, after all this time, making some changes because the community has demanded them and because the Opposition has changed the timeframes and the Government has suddenly decided it had better do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say to us, `Well, you have changed the timeframe from 245 days total to 155 days. You have changed the time in which, if you have a case to answer, you can get an answer from the Customs Service. You have changed the time from the preliminary hearings'. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) probably totally agrees with all the changes that we have made but he is not able to say so. He might&mdash;if he is honest enough. People say, `You have changed the time for the preliminary findings to 60 days'&mdash;and a grin tells a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say to us, `There is no doubt that you are getting to the fine edge of the time slots that are needed for proper evidential procedures to take place', and we agree. Sixty-five days in total or 60 days for the preliminary hearing is getting to the close edge of the time slots, but I think it is a matter of instruction and resources. The Customs Service has a lot of resources, and it is a matter of rejigging those resources to make sure that those people who feel they have been besieged by people dumping or&mdash;as is very likely and as has no doubt been happening in this country&mdash;sending subsidised goods here from the other end of the world have a set of procedures which they can get to quickly, which they can trust and which will not unduly affect them financially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the 60-day measure, which is the Opposition's policy, is possible, and that the timeframes the Government has finally, after all this time, been brought to are not needed. After all these years the Government is finally down to having the preliminary hearings in a total of 125 days&mdash;prima facie 25 and preliminaries 100&mdash;compared with the coalition's 65. The end of those preliminary hearings will give people the confidence of knowing that they will either get their case thrown out or get a measure in place which they can trust, and that is very important. In previous legislation the Government agreed with us that the sunset period of five years needed to be brought in, and that has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to these Bills, I have said that the method of collection has been changed. Each time there is an importation there will be a system whereby the dumping margin can be collected. In other words, people will not be able to solve the problem initially and have it go away if they have been in the business of cheating. This is important because, as protection comes down in this country, predictably and transparently so people can see it, those people competing in this country with the rest of the world must know that the treasuries of other countries cannot be used against them without retribution being applied to those exporters from other countries who are using either internal subsidisation or export enhancement, the American system. Where companies dump for whatever reason, people must feel that in fact they can overcome those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of fear out there. It is not a fear of having to compete in Australia. Many people now understand that we will have to compete in the international market. If we want to be exporters it is no good sitting here behind a barrier of defensive mechanisms saying, `We will just increase the defensive mechanisms if we cannot compete'. People understand that we are in the world marketplace, but they need to know that there is a mechanism to defend them against the international cheats who use a dumping mechanism where they just get rid of their excess supply into those countries that will take it or, alternatively, use their countries' largess, their countries' treasuries, as we have seen so many times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that these two Bills will help people increase their confidence. I repeat: I wish that this Government would seriously take on board the problem of the timeframes. The timeframes in these anti-dumping procedures are too long. There is no problem with the onus of proof in the initial hearings: the onus of proof is upon those persons who say that somebody is cheating. In the second and final hearings the onus of proof in fact changes. Once there is an anti-dumping duty and interim penalty upon a person, in the second and final hearings the person has to prove he was in the right. In other words, the onus of proof changes at the second hearing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should think that getting to a single system rather than a dual system and getting a tighter handle on that single system in respect of that material which is categorised as M, or what we may term as other categories of M, and at the same time seeing to what extent those classifications and changes of time presentation materially advance the removal of a lot of this material&mdash;particularly violent material&mdash;from children, is a useful, sensible thing to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is also about Australian families, is directed to the Prime Minister.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last day or two I have said that the number of enterprise agreements concluded under this Government continues to multiply. The new Australian Airlines flight attendants' agreement, for example, raises productivity and at the same time introduces a provision allowing special leave for employees to take care of sick children. I commend this sort of provision to the Parliament because it demonstrates that we are recognising in the workplace the special needs of families when more and more mothers are in the paid work force and more fathers are taking responsibility for the care of children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Australian workplace is rapidly being transformed with greater flexibility and higher productivity. Part of that greater flexibility will enhance the convenience and reward of work for women employees, many of whom are juggling child-care with part or full time work. I referred earlier to the family summit organised today by Ita Buttrose. This morning I nominated how we as a country could go about reconciling work and family as a vital issue for consideration during the International Year of the Family, which is coming up in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that women in this community are now quite deeply concerned about changes to the industrial relations system after what we have seen in Victoria. Under Victorian awards, working women have already lost the annual leave loading and very soon they will lose weekend penalties. They know that these benefits have not been lost through consultation or on any bargain basis or with any compensating benefit. For occupations like nursing the effects are going to be quite catastrophic as a substantial proportion of the working week is in penalty time and for which they have been paid. I noticed on television the other night that Mr Gude was quite proud of the fact that it will be a criminal offence&mdash;can you imagine this?&mdash;in the State of Victoria to fail to comply with any provisions of one of the employment contracts. It is not a matter of industrial disputation to be industrially bargained. It will be a criminal offence if someone breaks an element of the employment contracts.</PARA>

It does not support families that need support. That is why it does not care about the impact of its industrial legislation. It supports traditional associations, presumably those of the distant past where we had a more traditional construction for families. But where social justice is defined, the association between employers and employees would be reweighted against the employees as it was a century ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party supposedly supports family traditions, but it does not support women in Australian families who are going to have their incomes cut.

It does not support the essentials of the family's existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this legislation basically attacks penalty rates and other conditions of employment such as we have seen in the Australian Airlines flight attendants agreement which raises productivity and at the same time allows provisions for women particularly to look after sick children. All of that goes in the industrial legislation proposed by the Opposition, the same Opposition which tells us ad nauseam that it believes in the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of how, under this Government, industrial agreements are being negotiated flexibly to really look after the patterns of work that are needed in the workplace, particularly to look after the interests of Australian women, those with children, looking after families.

I remind the Prime Minister of the statement he made in his last answer to the question from the honourable member for Farrer. He said that the Liberal and National parties are doing nothing to induce a recovery. Has the Prime Minister seen the report on AAP today concerning a major drug company's decision to go ahead with a new investment in a new factory in Victoria?

Here are a few of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years Australian teams have been bringing home larger and larger swags of gold and silver medals from the international academic olympiads. In the physics olympiad this year, we won our first ever silver medal and were ranked tenth out of 42 competing nations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be proud of these attainments of our kids. The fact that we have an education system that is producing in this way is a matter of some pride to us. It is not laurels which we rest on.

We do it on a cooperative basis with the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been getting in place a structure for a national curriculum, and that has been done again on a cooperative basis with the States. We have reached agreement on national education objectives. We are getting to the point, which is so important to parents in this country, where people can shift through the Australian education system&mdash;again on a basis of negotiating with the States&mdash;and end up more or less at the same level in each particular State. Those are the positions that we are adopting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition proposes to cut education expenditure effectively via the cuts to the States and to charge university fees as a means of answering a level of demand of young people to get into universities. It also proposes to take back from the State systems the $720m which we are giving them to improve TAFE and turn it into a voucher program for kids who go out and negotiate their one-off contracts with business around the place, as though a kid would be in a position to know what to do with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said, `There is only one President of the United States of America'. I want to say, likewise, in the terms of the Australian context, that there is only one Prime Minister of Australia, and he must accept responsibility for the recession we had to have. He must accept responsibility for the record unemployment, the million people without jobs right around Australia; he must accept responsibility for the record levels of net foreign debt gripping Australia now and gripping Australia in terms of future generations; he must accept responsibility for the record farm failures right across so many parts of Australia, particularly the drought affected areas, but far beyond those areas. In particular, the Prime Minister must accept responsibility for producing this shabby One Nation statement and then, in the nine months since that time, proceeding to do everything to divide Australia, to divide the cohesion and fabric of our society, particularly in the way he has attacked our great Australian national flag; in the way he has attacked our constitutional monarchy; and, more recently, the way he has attacked one half of the Federal Parliament, namely, the institution of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister loses the forthcoming Federal election, he will look back on 1992 for those key turning points, and he will pick out a couple of particular days when he blew it and in fact paved the way for the change of government that is coming here in Australia&mdash;whether this Government likes it or not. I refer in particular to the day when the Prime Minister said, `This is the recession we had to have'. I refer the Prime Minister to his further statement that `the recession ended long ago'. I refer him to his statement, `I saved Australia', and I refer him to his unforgivable statement that `the Senate is unelected unrepresented swill', and that `they are all pansies'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I say to the House that the Senate is part of the governance of Australia; it is very much an important part of the constitutional circumstance of Australia. I warn the Prime Minister that, at this time of great economic agony, if he continues to pursue this agenda of a republic of Australia, and continues to pursue the denigration of the Senate, then he will set alight those forces of division and separation, particularly in some of the smaller States. For every day that he remains in office he has a responsibility to try to get this country back on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truth of the matter is that we have never ever had a Prime Minister so negative in attitude of mind and in activity than the Prime Minister that we have today. I say further to the House that he is going to pay a price for that negative attitude, with not one positive idea beyond the shabby document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, that he presented. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) will support me in this matter of public importance and will deal with aspects particularly in relation to a lack of road funding. But let me quote to the House from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> which, in a sense, says it all when we judge and assess its performance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement is very much about making this nation strong . . . A nation in which our rail, road, sea and air services serve us better and bind us together as a federation&mdash;as one nation.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that! Let us examine that statement. The honourable member for Wannon will deal with roads because we have had the extraordinary situation where the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has had to revoke allocations to the States. Today, as we speak, and as the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) points out, the Port of Melbourne is closed at the behest of the Prime Minister, at the behest of Halfpenny, at the behest of Curran, and at the behest of Kirner. Some progress! The cost, for example, of moving newsprint across a wharf in New Zealand is $4 a tonne. Moving it across a wharf in Melbourne, when it is not strikebound, it is $24 a tonne. Some reform? I think not. Some reform in terms of actual cost delivery? There is none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the issue of air. We now have the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and other senior Ministers, including the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), even refusing to condemn the prospect of an inevitable Christmas airlines strike across Australia which will flow from the conduct of the Prime Minister, the ACTU and John Halfpenny. It is unforgivable that the Prime Minister will not adopt the mantle of leadership to get this country back on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement states that the Government will revamp and revitalise our rail system. What a sad and sorry story we have in relation to railways, nine months later. The centrepiece of that development, the National Rail Corporation, is still not fully operational. Sure, it has been set up. It produces glossy reports. It has yet to run a train in its own name. It has yet to issue its shareholdings. The legislation is still before the Western Australian Parliament. The first part of a debate took place early in September. The Western Australian Government subsequently adjourned that debate. Maybe later today or in the near future it will bring that debate on again to allow for the passage of the National Rail Corporation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that this Government has failed in terms of delivering that legislation in accordance with the timetable to make the NRC operational. It has also failed in terms of developing the agreement with the trade unions to provide for the productivity and enterprise arrangements which were promised in relation to rail redevelopment. I highlight to the House that, whilst a memorandum of understanding was signed, very little additional progress has been made with the necessary union and industrial relations changes, which are so necessary to get rail to meet its performance criteria and to match world best practice. If we examined the detail of rail, we would find that Australia is a long way behind best world rail practice, and the situation is drifting further and further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some $400m was promised by this Government as part of the One Nation statement for the physical upgrading of rail in Australia. Guess how much of that has been spent? It is an amount a good deal less than 2 per cent. In terms of kilometres constructed, the whole thing is at zero. With a Labor Government in Victoria and a Federal Labor Government, for some seven months they still were not able to settle the standardisation of the rail route between Adelaide and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has still been unable to settle the arrangements associated with upgrading and providing additional railway line between Campbelltown and the freight depots in Sydney. It still has not been able to issue the tenders for the key link line between Acacia Ridge at the northern end of the standard gauge in Brisbane and Fishermans Island and the Brisbane port. It would now appear that the tenders for that work will not be released until next year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the whole program of rail upgrading promised in the One Nation statement has ceased. It has not even commenced. It has dragged along at a rate which is a disgrace. It shows that this Government cannot deliver on its promise and cannot match its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is timely to look at the number of statements that we have had in the last two years addressing the economic circumstances of Australia, remembering that this Government led Australia into recession ahead of the rest of the world, provided the framework, basis and lack of confidence to ensure that we had a recession worse than most of the world, and is now wrecking the prospect of recovery by the approach of, particularly, the Prime Minister who is, above all else, a political animal first and an Australian citizen second. It gives me no joy to give that description to our Prime Minister, but that is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of the industry statement of March 1991. Honourable members might recall it. I am sure it is in the back of their memories. Do honourable members remember the industry statement of March 1991 when then Prime Minister Bob Hawke was going to bounce us out of recession? Then we had the Budget by that famous former Treasurer of the Labor Party, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin)&mdash;his famous first and last Budget, which did so much damage to the economic circumstances of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in November 1991 we had another statement, that last ditch statement by the then Prime Minister. Do honourable members remember what that was called? It was called the jobs statement. Thousands of Australians have lost their jobs since the November 1991 statement produced by the then Prime Minister in a last ditch effort to hold off the now Prime Minister. Of course, that failed too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in February of this year we had the One Nation statement and an income tax cut schedule which is not able to be delivered, which is a pipedream and which, of course, does not alter the threshold level one dollar. As such, it is stacked against the spouses, the part time work force and the retirees in a very cruel way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard the usual diatribe from those opposite. They do not take into account the consequences that their policy mix would have in addressing the problems this country currently faces. The Opposition's contribution always has an overwhelming emphasis on the negatives. I would like to point out a few positives that the Government has been able to achieve in recent years which put a different light on the claim that this Government has been completely ineffective in putting through major reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Government came to office it had a tax system which, in the words of Professor Russell Mathews, one of Australia's leading taxation authorities, was such that the decision to pay tax was essentially optional for wealthy people. It was so full of holes and so riven with potential loopholes that it really was a matter as to whether they chose to pay tax or not. That tax system has been comprehensively overhauled with the introduction of the capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and a range of other measures. So we now have an income tax system which operates in some sort of worthwhile fashion. The Opposition neglected that system for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has achieved major changes in its industry structure. Let us look at the composition of our manufacturing sector. A decade ago 13 per cent of our manufacturing production was exported. That percentage is now up to 22 per cent. Three-quarters of our basic metal products are now exported; textiles, 54 per cent; and processed food, 24 per cent; et cetera. There has been a major change. In the last few years we have had a rate of increase in elaborately transformed manufactures in the exports from this country which has been one of the highest rate of increases, if not the highest, in the OECD area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, if we look at the whole area of research and development and go back to when this Government came to office, we see that we had an absolutely pathetic performance in investment in research and development in the private sector. There has been a virtual doubling since then of the proportion of research and development expenditure by the private sector as a proportion of GDP. In recent years we have had one of the most rapid increases in private investment in research and development in the OECD area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of underlying structural changes that we need are taking place. We have also seen substantial micro-economic reform in a range of areas that those opposite have always mouthed slogans about, but when they were in office they did very little. In the case of the waterfront, productivity has more than doubled and turnaround times have been reduced by 34 per cent. Our ports are now internationally competitive. We have seen reform in telecommunications and aviation&mdash;I will not attempt to enumerate all the areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have been achieved in the context of relative industrial peace. We are now looking at a major revamp of our industrial relations framework with a move towards enterprise bargaining, but that is being done in the context of consensus and cooperation with the trade union movement&mdash;a total contrast with the sort of confrontational policies that we have seen implemented by the Kennett Government in Victoria and which provide a stark prefiguration of the sorts of effects we could see from the implementation of the coalition's industrial relations agenda at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address myself to the One Nation statement, because that is the main topic of this MPI today. In the One Nation statement the Government sought to do a number of things. Firstly, it sought to provide a significant fiscal boost which will be of the order of $1.8 billion this year. Effectively the Opposition is saying that it wants to cut the Budget deficit by $7 billion, which will have the effect of reducing employment by about 125,000. Bankers Trust Managing Director, Mr Ferguson, was quoted yesterday as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cutting deficits . . . would force down profitability in the private sector and it's already low, it will force people to shed labour and that's shedding consumers as well, and it will be a self-defeating process in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA>So, right smack in the middle of a recession, what does the Opposition say? It wants to tighten fiscal policy very substantially. That will only darken significantly the prospects for economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also refer to the OECD economic policy committee, which said that it would be sensible for countries in our sort of position to relax fiscal policy to some extent to counter what it called the relatively weak and uncertain prospects for economic growth, current economic difficulties shared by the Western world as a whole. In fact, Australian growth, which is projected at 3 per cent in 1992-93, will be significantly above the OECD average, which is projected at 1 1/2 per cent in 1992 and 2.1 per cent in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well placed to deliver a fiscal boost. If we look at the state of our public finances, it can be seen that we have one of the lowest levels of public debt to GDP ratio amongst developed countries. This fiscal boost has taken the form of a targeted set of measures designed to improve long term competitiveness, and that includes major investments in physical infrastructure, particularly road and rail. This was opposed by the Opposition, which failed to recognise the central importance of physical infrastructure in improving economic productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had that rather silly contribution from the Leader of the National Party, who talked about the fact that, because we have not already spent all that money, the whole program is a failure. The reality is that with very major infrastructure programs of the sort that are being implemented, as outlined in the One Nation statement, a fairly substantial planning process has to be gone through. That is the reality, and to suggest otherwise&mdash;that we should just rush in and suddenly pour out buckets of money without going through a proper evaluation and planning process&mdash;is to put a ludicrous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another element in the One Nation statement is a major boost to investment in education and training. Michael Porter, one of the world's leading experts in the whole area of the economic competitiveness of countries, has made the point that the education and training sector is one of the key points of leverage for government in improving international competitiveness and fostering industry restructuring. We have seen a major attempt to address the problems of particularly the vocational education and training sector, which complements the major expansion in the higher education system, the very large increase in participation, and the roughly one-third real increase in expenditure since the higher education White Paper. Again, these are crucial decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has tried to jump on the bandwagon with some of those. On the one hand, it says it will match our spending on education and training; on the other hand, if we look at the fine print in terms of what it is taking away, by means of very substantial cuts in labour market programs, for example&mdash;which largely parallel the purpose of the Opposition's training vouchers&mdash;we see that, far from boosting education and training expenditure, the Opposition is committed to a substantial fall in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all those areas which are addressed in the One Nation statement&mdash;crucially important areas, which are entirely appropriate in current economic circumstances&mdash;the Opposition's position of opposition to those highly constructive measures ought to be seen as quite destructive of this country's economic potential. The One Nation statement also involved a number of proposals, particularly an improved tax regime to encourage the private sector to accelerate and bring forward investment&mdash;things such as the development allowance, the improved depreciation structure and so forth. These are measures which will all bring about significant benefits to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the One Nation statement, we have seen additional substantial commitments by the Government through the national education and training plan for young Australians. An additional $770m will be provided over three years, which is a very significant response to the education and training needs of young people. By the end of this decade we aim to make participation in education and training virtually universal for young people leaving school. The local capital works program and increased spending on labour market programs are crucial to the prevention of the entrenchment of a large body of long term unemployed people in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These programs have been the subject recently of some pretty comprehensive and thorough studies by international experts. There is no doubt that they have a crucial role to play in avoiding a situation where a large proportion of our labour force becomes permanently alienated from the world of work, the sort of situation that occurs in some European countries where three generations are unemployed&mdash;grandparents, parents and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that throughout the Western world at the moment most developed countries are experiencing severe economic difficulties, the Anglo-Saxon world in particular. The United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are all experiencing severe problems. No honest person could possibly argue that, irrespective of what government was in office at the moment, we would not be experiencing a very difficult economic situation. I do not think anybody could seriously contest that. The governments I have just referred to are right across the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant question to ask is whether the policy mix proposed by the Opposition would improve or darken our prospects. Let us look at the sort of mix that the Opposition is talking about&mdash;the introduction of the GST and the sorts of changes to the industrial relations framework&mdash;and what the macro-economic effect of that would be, what it would do to gross domestic product growth, to unemployment and inflation. The fact is that there is pretty much a consensus amongst economists at the moment that, for the next five to 10 years, those policies would have a detrimental effect on all of those variables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> recently did a survey of economists in both the public and private sector. A clear consensus of those economists was that Fightback would mean lower, slower growth, higher unemployment, higher inflation and higher interest rates. If the margin is averaged out by which they say coalition policies would increase unemployment, it averages out at a figure of 1.6 per cent&mdash;that is 1.6 per cent higher unemployment than under the Government's policy mix. That represents 140,000 more unemployed people. Obviously that sort of policy will darken our economic prospects. The Opposition's own economic modelling confirms that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also shows a variety of possible outcomes&mdash;they are all bad. If we assume that the Opposition is unable to contain the inflationary impact of the GST on wages, then that is the worst case scenario and that will produce substantial falls in GDP growth and a significantly worse unemployment outcome. The reality is that the Opposition, through its industrial relations policy, has no framework with which it could hope to contain the inflationary impact of the GST on wages. On the balance of probabilities, we would have to say that the outcome would be at the worst end of the projections by these various economists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has essentially admitted to these problems. He is quoted as saying: `I am not making promises about the level of unemployment. There will be transition effects'&mdash;transition effects indeed. What that would do is take an economy which is obviously encountering difficulties and coming out of recession, but slowly at the moment, and drive that economy into a hole. We would see the macro-economic impact of the GST on growth, employment and inflation. On top of that, we would see&mdash;for a period, undoubtedly&mdash;a state of industrial relations chaos. We would have an industrial relations system which would be incapable of insulating inflation from the effects of the GST on the price level. If we were to take the Opposition seriously, we would see a $7 billion cut in the deficit&mdash;a major contraction of fiscal policy. The effect of all that on this country's economic fortunes and, I believe, the social stability of the country to implement a range of policies of that kind, would obviously be catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Opposition tries to imply that our current economic difficulties are entirely a consequence of bad government policy. This is the thrust of what it has had to say. Let us examine this proposition. If the Government is to be criticised for getting anything wrong in a policy sense, it might be argued that we held back too long in terms of the relaxation of monetary policy that took place, starting in 1990. It could be said that that should have been done earlier and that we underestimated the impact of the tightening of monetary policy. What was the Opposition saying at this time? On every occasion the Government moved to relax monetary policy, it was subject to attack by the Leader of the Opposition. He accused us of politicising the Reserve Bank. He attacked every move to relax monetary policy from the middle of 1990 on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition is going to say that our current economic problems are a consequence of policy errors by the Government, then how much more severe would those problems have been had we followed the policy prescriptions of the Leader of the Opposition at the time? We would obviously be in a far worse situation than we are now. If the Opposition's Fightback package were to be implemented, there is not the slightest doubt that we would see the economy of this country driven into a hole and the creation of economic and social problems of a magnitude that I do not believe we have seen before in the history of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's total incompetence in delivering reform and appropriate economic management, epitomised by the failure of the One Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse the words of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). He made an excellent speech. Listening to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) reminded me of a book I saw in a bookshop somewhere entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">How to lie with statistics</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had a visitor to this gallery. He came to watch the proceedings of the chamber, particularly the shambles of Question Time. He walked out and said, `I think I have just seen a government in decay'. I think that really sums up this Government&mdash;it is a government in decay. We are now seeing what this Government has inflicted on all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What better way to illustrate it than the tragedy of the one million unemployed. Since the last election&mdash;I remind honourable members that this is only since the last election&mdash;the number of people unemployed has nearly doubled. Yet whenever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is asked a question such as the one he was asked today, he continues to skirt around it and avoid it. As the Leader of the National Party put it so succinctly, it comes down to a failure to lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the response of the Government? Basically it has been one of panic. The February One Nation statement was the sixth economic statement in the term of this Parliament; the Budget was the seventh. As well we have had three other statements, as my colleague the Leader of the National Party pointed out. The February statement was clearly very ill-thought out. Listening to the pathetic excuses from the Minister as to why it has not been implemented struck me as a rather direct backhander to his own Leader for his failure to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a boost in public debt. Public debt is ballooning because the panic is spreading. Debt has increased by so much that the interest paid by the public purse in the coming year will increase by a massive 26 per cent and in the year after it by 36 per cent. Then we will see what the total incompetence of this Government has been all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ballooning foreign debt and the current account deficit have become a constant source of embarrassment. Bankruptcies are at a record high. I have already mentioned the problems of unemployment. More recently we have seen the cover-up in the Victorian loans affair. All of this is clear evidence of a government in crisis and of a government so moribund and incompetent that it has had to keep changing its mind. If the decisions made affected only the Government, it would not be so serious, but they are having a serious effect on every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These policy failures have led to the worst recession in 60 years. We saw the problems which were created by interest rates in 1989-90, which led the Prime Minister to the excuse that `this is the recession we had to have anyway'. It all leads to the very serious problem of lack of confidence throughout Australia. Is it little wonder that there is such a lack of confidence in the community? Who would want to invest in the current climate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, interest rates shot up to 25 per cent in the late 1980s and no-one doubts the capacity of this Government to do it again if it reaches another point of panic and sees another one of its failures. Without that investment the unemployment rate will remain tragically high. Contrary to what the Minister said, education on its own will not solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the September quarter we saw 43,900 people lose their jobs, and tomorrow's figures do not look all that optimistic either. One million people&mdash;nearly 11 per cent of our work force&mdash;are out of work; many of them as a result of the incompetence of this Government. I do not believe that anyone should stand by and accept the current levels of unemployment. The question must be asked: how can the Government miscalculate it so often? In his One Nation speech, the Prime Minister made this great statement. He said that he pledged to fight the battle against unemployment&mdash;which of course he largely created&mdash;and for economic recovery with all the energy he could muster. He went on to say, `Tonight we turn these words into action'. That was some action. The only job that he seemed to be trying to preserve was his own. He created unemployment in the first place and then he tried to promise to undo the problem. In fact, what has happened? There has been nothing short of a string of failures. After all, the One Nation statement was supposed to be about creating employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of those reform failures. Let us look at the area of land transport in which I have a direct interest. Nearly a billion dollars was allocated to road and rail projects, but hardly any of these projects have come to fruition and most are unlikely to until late next year. The primary focus was supposed to be on land transport infrastructure. There were supposed to be 21,000 jobs created in two years&mdash;15,000 from road and 6,000 from rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering that the money which was included for roads came from a very low base. It was supposed to create 50,000 jobs in one year. We have the situation with One Nation where there are only 13 months to go; and with the Budget there are only seven months to go. Yet very little money has been spent and very few jobs have been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague has already mentioned some of the problems and failures associated with investment in rail. Rail spending was supposed to create 4,000 jobs in 1992-93, but less than $8m of the $454m that was supposed to have been spent has been spent so far, and we are nearly halfway through the financial year. There is little prospect of this in the short term because no project manager has been appointed, let alone any building contractors. It will be months before anything is likely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in February, the Prime Minister said that he would create jobs. The National Rail Corporation is in a marvellous position. It has not one, but three, headquarters but it does not have a train. One of those headquarters is on the forty-fourth floor of the Rialto building in Melbourne. It is hardly what one would call a frugal way to start a business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have these three headquarters staffed by some people on very high salaries, but there are no trains. It is just like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> series. Do honourable members remember that episode when we had the hospital with everyone working there but no patients? It has a familiar ring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question has to be asked: how many jobs have been created? At the same time, we have a situation where some of the railways have been discarding jobs&mdash;including the Commonwealth's own railway, Australian National, where jobs have been cut. The question has to be asked: how many millions of dollars has this exercise cost and how little has the true gain been? We must also ask: when is the Prime Minister going to tell the Australian people why he has failed so miserably?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look at the question of roads. There were supposed to be 15,000 jobs created in this area. How many have been created so far? Less than half the funds that were supposed to be allocated in the first quarter of this financial year have been spent. The Minister has suspended the payments. When honourable members look at the facts they will find that much of the cause of this delay has been the Government's own tardiness in approving projects. It has nothing to do with the States; it is the Government's own tardiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my point about incompetence in delivering reform. We should look at the question of physical problems. The Minister may say that it is not his fault that we have had a fairly wet winter and spring in some parts of Australia, but the point is that he was incompetent enough not to realise that when it comes to road building one has to take seasonal factors into account. Winter is not the most economical time to build a road, so why expect it to built. Even when it comes to spending the money&mdash;even when it has been allocated&mdash;the Government cannot get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think whatever way we look at it, we are seeing the total incompetence of this Government and we are seeing the impact that that is having on the confidence of Australians. We are seeing the fact that, contrary to what the Minister said a minute ago, the unemployment problem will not be solved because we are not coming out of the recession and the Government is not tackling the real problem. It is a very serious matter. This Government has failed to deliver reform. Its economic management is anything but appropriate and the One Nation statement is just a symptom of its incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession clearly continues, the debt climbs, and unemployment continues to affect virtually every Australian. In short, Labor has betrayed all Australians. While the Government may think what it is doing is good politics, it sure as hell is not good government.

The Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to road funding. In 1992-93 the Government is providing a record amount of money for road construction&mdash;$2.1 billion. In One Nation, an additional $600m was provided, and it is my understanding that $600m will be spent. So much for the criticisms of the Opposition. The honourable member for Wannon says that hardly any of it will come to fruition this year. Perhaps the honourable member for Wannon has not driven through a few of the electorates of some of his colleagues on ring road 33 from Hornsby down through Pennant Hills. He should have a look at the work that is being done in the electorates of some of his colleagues. It is work funded by One Nation. In his own electorate I bet funds are being spent because of One Nation. Look at the high level Glebe Island bridge. The Liberal State Government of New South Wales could not afford to build it. It was only through One Nation that the funding was provided and the work is going on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the honourable member for Wannon say that there are no results from all this money flowing into the economy? Even the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is out there trying to get a few brownie points from the work that the Federal Government is arranging in his own electorate, because ring road 33 did not get too far under his side of politics. But we have ensured that there is proper road infrastructure in Sydney and other capital cities. Every time we have spent a dollar, who has opposed it?  The Liberal and National parties. So it not just in rail; it is in road. It is also in aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation we made a few promises. We said that there would be a trans-Tasman market for aviation. What do we have?  We have a trans-Tasman market for aviation in only six months. We said that Qantas would fly domestic. On 1 November what happened? Qantas began flying domestic passengers. People in the gallery have probably already seen the discount offers advertised by Qantas. There has been a saving for Australian tourists, Australian domestic air travellers, as a result of the initiatives in One Nation. In addition, very shortly we will have Ansett flying internationally and, as a result, a more competitive environment and lower air fares for the Australian travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In electricity, we have had the Government establish the concept of a national electricity grid. We have the National Grid Management Council about to bring down its report on pricing mechanisms. There has been a round table to ensure that there is a strategy for separating the transmission of electricity from the generation of electricity. Power stations will compete with each other so that domestic electricity consumers will get cheaper prices and industrial electricity consumers will get cheaper prices. That will mean that there is to be more capacity for industries to create jobs and investment, and that is good for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alternative offered by the Opposition? Not only does it criticise every measure that we bring in here to give the economy a boost and create jobs, but also its solution to Australia's recession is to impose a new 15 per cent consumption tax on every good and service traded in Australia. It is saying that there should be a new 15 per cent consumption tax on food, clothing, services, telephone bills, electricity bills and water and sewerage rates. It says that there should be zero tariffs; we should wipe out the Australian car industry. The $1.2 billion of exports that the motor vehicle industry earns every year for Australia would be placed in jeopardy by its zero tariff policy. The Australian car industry and the components manufacturers have made it clear which side of politics is going wipe out the 50,000 jobs in the Australian car industry. It is the Liberal and National parties that are proposing a zero tariff regime that will wipe out employment in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time today we had the Opposition's plans for tourism mentioned again. It is very clear that the Opposition's policy will do severe damage to the Australian tourism industry by affecting domestic and international tourists. When members of the public in the gallery choose between a holiday in Fiji or a holiday in Cairns, they will have to pay 15 per cent more for the holiday in Cairns because of the Opposition's GST. It has made it clear that your package holiday in Fiji or any other overseas destination will be free of GST, but your holiday at an Australian destination will be subject to the GST. At the same time we have had the Opposition running around with all these pamphlets. Its first pamphlet said that the best thing about a GST was that it would hit the tax dodgers and the international tourists. Version two suddenly deleted the impact on the international tourists and referred only to the tax dodgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that these measures that the Opposition is proposing will not only wipe out tourism and jobs in the motor vehicle industry but also create havoc throughout the whole of the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project&mdash;Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre.</PARA>
<PARA>The defence logistics redevelopment project, which was announced by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in June 1990, implements a rationalised and centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. Substantial savings will be achieved through the reduction in operating and manpower costs. Revenue from the subsequent disposal of redundant property at Randwick, Zetland, Regents Park, Broadmeadows, Tottenham, Banyo and Toowoomba will largely offset the cost of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central part of this strategy is a modern tri-service storage and distribution facility, the defence national storage and distribution centre, which is to be established primarily at Moorebank. Additional warehousing accommodation at Leichhardt, Regents Park, Bathurst and Dubbo will also be used. Concurrently, each service will improve its regional warehousing infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence national storage and distribution centre will accommodate most of Navy stocks, a small element of Air Force stocks and part of the Army national stocks plus those Army logistics functions currently the responsibility of the Moorebank logistics group. The accommodation provided will be a combination of new facilities and existing facilities which will be upgraded, where appropriate. This will give the Defence Force a modern and efficient warehousing complex which will enable current technology and systems to be best utilised. The construction of the defence national storage and distribution centre will allow the closure of warehousing operations at Randwick, Zetland and Penrith and will contribute to the part closure of Regents Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental effects of the planned redevelopment works have been determined to be minimal as works are restricted to the confines of existing bases. An environmental certificate of compliance has been issued. The estimated cost of the proposed works at April 1992 prices is $100m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Public Works Committee agreed to the defence logistic redevelopment project&mdash;defence national storage and distribution centre, but raised the following specific issues. Firstly, there should be continuing consultation between defence and the work forces at all establishments at which redundancies are programmed to occur to ensure that the personnel involved are assisted in finding alternative employment. A formal mechanism to achieve this objective should be established. Secondly, during the development of the proposal and after the work has been completed defence should continue formal liaison, including site visits, with the New South Wales fire brigades. Thirdly, as part of the study of fire risks throughout all defence installations currently being undertaken, a formal risk management analysis of existing and proposed facilities should be carried out by an independent professionally qualified fire safety consultant. Fourthly, for the defence national storage and distribution centre to be successfully implemented, it will be necessary for the supply systems redevelopment project to be completed on time. Defence should provide the funds and resources for the successful completion of the supply systems redevelopment project. Also, there is an urgent need for the provision of undercover parking for Army vehicles at Moorebank. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to understand the depth of the crisis that we now suffer in Australia. It is a crisis of quite enormous proportion. I saw an article in one of the newspapers today that suggested that this is a world-wide problem and that we ought to see ourselves as being no different to any other part of the world. It is often argued that there are people on the move throughout the world seeking new opportunities for themselves and their families and one ought not to be surprised that some people looking for those opportunities make their way to Australia. It is argued, therefore, that we ought not to be unduly perturbed at the facts which are relevant to this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts cannot be forgotten and they cannot be glossed over. We now have something of the order of 21,700 asylum seekers in Australia applying for refugee status. Some 500 or so people who have arrived in small boats, small craft, have also sought asylum and are being held while their claims are being determined. There are some 20,000 or so Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, as well as their 7,000 or so dependents who have since come to Australia, whose situation remains unresolved and who, in many cases, might well be seeking protection after June 1994 in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these large numbers of people who have entered Australia on a whole variety of bases have put our system for determining questions relating to refugee status under enormous stress. We used to deal with something of the order of 500 applications a year. When one looks at the large numbers of people now in the system, the enormity of that problem, I think, can be readily appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this crisis has now been with us for almost three years. Some people remain held in detention. I am not one who complains about the quality of that detention in terms of its ability to deal with situations of relatively short periods of duration, but some people have been held in detention for a very long time. The fact that some people are held in detention for that length of time is now having a very disastrous effect upon some of those people who have been so detained. In other words, it is the detention that is now impacting upon them and mitigating against our ability to handle their circumstances in a way which might otherwise be seen at any other time as being reasonable and appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these situations are on the record. I have emphasised them over a long time. Many of them are detailed in the report that was presented to the Parliament: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's refugee and humanitarian system&mdash;achieving a balance between control and refuge</EMPHASIS>. It is very important report that was prepared by members of this Parliament. It catalogues the problems that we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister would have us believe that, in relation to that, he has taken a series of steps at appropriate times and, because of certain circumstances beyond his control, certain other problems have arisen and we ought not to be unduly perturbed or judgmental in relation to these factors so far as the Government's record is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that is a reasonable judgment. I want to take the House through some of the matters that are detailed on the public record simply to reveal why we are in this crisis. Australia is a country that has a unique advantage over most other countries in dealing with these matters. We have water boundaries which insulate us from people who have the ability to come here and remain on our shores. I am sure that countries in Europe, the United States of America, North America generally, would very much like to be insulated in the way in which we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had what we have been assured over a long time is the most comprehensive&mdash;and some people complain about it, particularly those people in the tourist industry&mdash;visa system to ensure that people enter Australia after some inquiry as to their bona fides and to enable us to regulate that entry. The Bill now before the House is designed to further refine those arrangements. Yet, notwithstanding water boundaries and a visa system, we have a crisis which I think is comparable with that in Europe and in North America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numbers of reasons are given for the crisis that we face, but the principal reason, I think, relates to the large numbers of students who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the way in which that issue was dealt with by this Government, by this Minister's predecessors. It is important, I think, to note that at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, there were in Australia some 20,000 students from the People's Republic of China. They came here under a system designed to promote the sale of education about which this Government, through its Ministers, particularly the then Minister for Education, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), spoke with pride about its achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 8.10, on page 184 of the Committee's report, reveals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overstay rate for all overseas students in 1988/89 was 23.3 per cent and 40 per cent for PRC students in May 1989. This compared with a visitor overstay rate in that period of 1.8 per cent. Of the 15,111 PRC students who had arrived in Australia since 1 January 1986, only 1,685 . . . had left Australia by the end of May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the overstay rate of Chinese students at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre was well known, well understood and on the public record. From certain internal memos that later became known, I believe that the Minister's predecessor, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), was endeavouring to deal with that matter but other members of the Government resisted the efforts to constrain that program, which was already failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that because of a decision taken by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to allow all those students who were here at that time to remain and their relatives to join them later, in the order of 27,000 people from the People's Republic of China were allowed to remain here on a temporary entry basis&mdash;a discriminatory policy applied to nobody else from any other part of the world. In the main, they are still here today. Just to be precise and to give the House some idea of what has happened, table 8.1 of the report states that at pre-21 June 1989 arrivals&mdash;that is, pre Tiananmen Square arrivals&mdash;there were an estimated 21,000 PRC nationals in Australia and as at 31 May 1991 1,990 of those PRC nationals had departed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions taken in relation to that group of people, where case by case determination of claims for asylum were abandoned&mdash;presumably because of the large numbers of people involved&mdash;led to a situation where the Government allowed a large number of additional students into Australia under arrangements which I find reprehensible. The record in relation to their departure, revealed in the same table, is that there were 24,838 students admitted as at 31 May 1991 and departures of those students totalled 2,125. Almost 23,000 students who were allowed into Australia remained here as at 31 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those students should never have been allowed to come to Australia without efforts to test their bona fides. It is detailed very clearly in paragraph 8.15 of this report that the Government put in place arrangements which it describes euphemistically as pipeline processing arrangements. I quote what Senator Robert Ray, the Minister responsible, said in the Senate on 21 November 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `pipeline' processing measures are less stringent than the global measures (which will apply to PRC applicants from 1 January 1990) in that `pipeline' applicants will be assessed against a lower education level criterion (year 10 compared with year 12 for the global measures) and will not be subjected to more extensive immigration bona fides testing (required under the global measures).</PARA>
<PARA>This Government put in place arrangements to pipeline process all of these people into Australia without proper bona fides testing. Is it any wonder that they then made applications? They then tried to discover how they could stay in Australia after their visas expired. Some 17,000 of them have lodged applications for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we have some 21,700 unprocessed applicants today is that this Government applied pipeline processing arrangements which brought people into Australia who were not subjected to any reasonable bona fides testing. When we look at how long it takes the Government to act in relation to these matters, we find it was only a matter of weeks ago that, in relation to people who might still be seeking to come to Australia from the People's Republic of China, the Government has announced decisions that will in effect put a quota on the number of students and subject them to additional bona fides testing that is not applied to other students. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand the role of the courts in relation to this matter. The Government has proposed a system which will retain for the legal profession its rights to be involved in this area. It needs to be clearly understood that for a long time we had a system in which the process of refugee determination and the bona fides of claims was left in the hands of the government of the day to determine. They were administrative processes in which the legislation at no time even sought to define `refugee' for the very purpose of ensuring that this remained a matter for the government of the day to determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view was formed that people who arrive on our shore should be able to have their claims looked at but ought not to be able to access the full canopy of our Australian legal system, with all of its protections, administrative controls and review procedures. It was for a very good reason. Access is for Australian citizens and very often is at a cost to Australia and its citizens. To open Australia up to a situation in which the people of the world, at a cost to Australian taxpayers, can get access to our administrative review system and our legal system was never intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, after the Court had taken it upon itself to get into this area and to extend the law to ensure that the courts would have a role&mdash;and did so very creatively over time in a number of cases&mdash;is now concerned that the High Court, in its original jurisdiction, may have a fairly heavy workload in reviewing all of the cases that might come before it. I make it very clear on behalf of the Opposition that if the High Court, through its own endeavours, has sought such a workload and it believes it has the capacity through the decisions that it has taken to assume this responsibility, it ought to find it within its own resources and its own capacities to deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that we ought to amend the law to provide extra rights of appeal and to delegate the matter to other judges in order to relieve the court of that responsibility which arose from its own decisions is a matter that I would not contemplate in the legislature, and I hope the Government would not contemplate it. I am disappointed that the Government has gone to water in relation to this matter, because the system that it seeks to put in place still provides access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be able to be obtained. That is a matter of concern to us. We are concerned that the review system that the Government intends is one that all of the applicants will be able to access, whereas in our view it is only those who have arguable cases who should be able to obtain that access. We are disappointed that it is constrained in that way. </PARA>

I am disappointed, because the Bill is complex and very detailed, that this Parliament will not have an opportunity to debate at length the very extensive reforms contained in the legislation. Some of the matters which I think people ought to be aware of, and which the Opposition has considered&mdash;and it certainly has not demurred in relation to them&mdash;relate to, for instance, the requirement that all arrivals will present for immigration clearance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some concerns amongst Australians who do not hold an Australian passport&mdash;dual nationals&mdash;that they may be required to present an Australian passport or other evidence of their identity when returning to Australia. We do not demur in relation to that. We think that Australian citizenship is important and is of value. My Leader has spoken elsewhere today in relation to that. We think that it does not reflect well on Australian citizenship if citizens want to travel abroad on a passport issued by another country. The Government gets support from us on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill seeks to put the onus on people to provide evidence of their authority to be present in Australia. I have made some inquiries into the matter, and I seek the Minister's assurance in relation to the way in which that provision will operate. In the way in which the provisions are written, any one of us might be asked in the street for evidence. I am told that people should be approached only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they are non-citizens. Action would be taken, presumably, against departmental officials who did inquire about a person's identity without reasonable grounds to believe that a person is a non-citizen. It is a matter that needs to be addressed very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has determined in its wisdom to put in place a Refugee Review Tribunal. Instead of adopting the system proposed by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations whereby the Refugee Tribunal would develop its own ethos&mdash;a system in which senior members of a panel would be able to consider questions on which we might want to have a common approach&mdash;for consistency in decision-making, the Government has determined to refer those matters to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It almost seems to me, from the way in which it has been referred to that body, that the Government was worried about excluding it generally and needed to find a role for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the view that a body which has responsibilities that are much wider, when left remote from the issue of refugee determination and the particular issues that might be involved, could go the same way in deciding these matters as the High Court. In other words, decisions could be taken which have no real bearing upon the consequences that might flow from them. I think those people who are involved in the specialist tribunal will have that knowledge and awareness. Even though the senior member might be able to sit on that special body with other members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, my view is that that is a less than desirable way to deal with that issue. I would counsel the Minister, if he is going to look at any of these issues again, to take that matter on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other matters that I want to deal with in the few moments that are left to me. The Minister in his second reading speech referred to the situation concerning New Zealand nationals. He made the statement, which I strongly welcome, that this Bill, in introducing visa requirements which are to be of universal application, will put in place a special category for New Zealanders. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, limited categories of non-citizens, in particular New Zealanders, will still be able to travel to Australia without a visa and enter with the same degree of convenience as at present.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome that assurance, but I want to be sure that that will apply in practice. I notice that there are some provisions in the legislation which deal with the new system of visas. Proposed section 26(1)(3) in the Bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regulations may prescribe criteria for a visa or visas in a specialised class . . . provided for by section 26A, 26B or 26C but not by section 26D).</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed section 26A is the special category visas for New Zealanders. There is later a provision 26G(1) which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations may provide that visas, or visas in a specified class&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>As it uses the same terms as are seen in proposed sections 21 and 26(1)(3), it is clear to me from the way in which that provision is written that one could prescribe, through regulations, visas that would require people to present visas and, besides that, impose conditions in relation to them about the work that may be done in Australia by a holder. That would be a limitation that is not possible now. It is one that I do not think this legislation ought to authorise or be a matter that ought to be dealt with by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would seek the Government's assurance that that provision does not apply to enable a government to be able to put in such a restriction. I would hope in another place it would be amended if it has that meaning, because I think the message that the Minister put in his speech needs to be clear and unambiguous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by raising a matter relating to unauthorised arrivals in Australia. When people arrive in Australia at an airport they are given a statement of rights before they are turned around, if they are here illegally. I would like to know whether that same practice operates in relation to other unauthorised arrivals in Australia, and particularly in relation to the 113 or so people who were turned around last week. I have no doubt that that would have been done, but I would like the Minister's assurance in relation to it because it is a practice that is carried out with border arrivals at airports. It seems to me that it should apply elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> raised another matter relating to the maximum number of visas that might be granted and suggested that there could be quotas. That is a matter which is of concern to me. If this Bill authorises quotas that could be reached and the remaining applications lapse in the way in which it is described here, it would be of concern to me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Migration Reform Bill 1992 and, in so doing, to oppose the amendment. I listened very carefully to what the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), had to say. On a number of occasions he said that the immigration process in this country is in a state of crisis. I stopped marking down the number of times in which he used the word `crisis' when I got to seven. I then listened more attentively for the evidence he was going to provide to show that this system is in crisis. As evidence for this, he said that 20,000 Chinese students were given a particular status as a result of the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989. I listened very carefully and heard no more evidence for the assertion that our system of admissions is in as much crisis as that in North America or in western Europe. It has been reported recently in the paper that 400,000 people in Germany were seeking political refugee status. Large numbers are entering, particularly the United States of America and Canada, on this basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that in 1989 we faced a very difficult situation, with about 20,000 PRC nationals in this country in an international context, of the democratisation of communist societies, which has gone ahead in almost every communist state other than the People's Republic of China, and a reasonable expectation that the democratisation process that was under way in China would continue. On that expectation, and in that context, 20,000 Chinese students had entered Australia, mostly with a view to studying the English language. Then, to the horror not just of our own society but that of the entire world, the Old Guard of Chinese communists in Beijing used armour in order to put down the democratisation movement, notably in Beijing, and later elsewhere in the country, moving in troops from regions not affiliated with the students whom they had to put down, murder, butcher, and run over with tracked, armoured personnel carriers and tanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background we had to decide what to do with these 20,000 Chinese students who had a reasonable expectation of receiving some form of asylum and protection from the democratic society that is Australia. Within that context, decisions were made with the prime purpose of protecting these people against being sent them back with the likelihood of them being severely repressed, if not killed. In that context, decisions were made by the then Prime Minister of Australia, later endorsed by a second Prime Minister of Australia, and accepted by the decision makers of this Government that protection should be afforded to these people. It is that process that is now seen as producing a crisis in the refugee admission system that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This seems to me to be short of the evidence one would require in order to demonstrate a system in crisis. In any case, it is difficult to concede that the system is in crisis when it produces an amendment to the Migration Reform Bill which, in part, addresses this supposed crisis. This amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That means, presumably, that the Opposition will not be opposing it. The amendment goes on to deplore, to note, and to regret certain aspects of government policy. Surely this is coming in with a bang and going out with a whimper. It is coming in with a bang of seven crises&mdash;at which point I stopped counting&mdash;and going out with a deplore, a note, and a regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point of fact, the Migration Reform Bill seeks to address the central problem which we face in the admission of various categories of visitors and settlers to this country, including political refugees, by striking a better balance between the rights of people to clear justice and a fair hearing in our processes, as against the enabling of undue and extended delays in the lodging and processing of applications for residency status in this country. These changes will replace the legislative framework which currently underpins the regulation of entry to and stay in Australia, as well as the detention and removal of non-citizens here unlawfully. It will instead provide a new and greatly extended basis for merits review of immigration decisions and, for the first time, provide independent determinative merits review of refugee related decisions. No-one suggests that it is easy to make the balance between the two considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who apply for status as residents of Australia, in whatever category and under whatever provisions, have some right to be considered, particularly if they are in Australia at the time. On the other hand, they, and the Australian community at large, should have some expectation that this application will be dealt with expeditiously. At times it has to be conceded that under the present arrangements this latter expectation has not been met. For example, people have been asking, quite rightly, why and for how long can aspiring political refugees stay in detention in Australia, some without even lodging their formal applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to resolve this dilemma by changing a few of the provisions in or reforming the Migration Act. It limits access to the Federal Court to those cases which are codified in the rules. In the case of onshore refugee applicants, it opens up the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, the RRT, which will expedite their processing. The RRT replaces the Refugee Status Review Committee, to provide determinative independent merits review of refugee status matters. In this particular tribunal, hearings will be possible whereas, at present, determination is made on the papers. In order to eliminate arbitrary decisions, it also codifies decision making by setting out the rights and obligations of applicants, and the obligations of the decision makers with respect to the applications. In addition, it then opens access to merits review in the Immigration Review Tribunal which has both a quicker and a wider range than the Federal Court, which in itself should speed up procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the purpose of these reforms is to strike a better balance between the expectations of justice and speed in processing applications for residence. Under these reforms, all non-Australian citizens will now require a visa to travel, enter and remain in Australia. The reform Bill provides for the creation of a special category visa which would be electronically issued on arrival in Australia. This would be applicable to persons who were previously exempt non-citizens, including New Zealand citizens. Since there has been some publicity given to the matter, I should point out that this status accorded to New Zealand citizens is presently under review within the Government's decision making processes. While that may be changed at some future time, it is not proposed to do so in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All arrivals will have to present themselves with evidence of Australian citizenship or a visa, or they may be detained pending clarification of their status. This reform Bill provides for a system of mandatory detention to be imposed on unlawful non-citizens. Except for unlawful non-citizens who seek to enter Australia in an unauthorised manner, unlawful citizens may be released from detention if they are granted a bridging visa. Bridging visas would enable them to remain in Australia pending the outcome of their visa application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlawful non-citizens may be removed from detention either after being granted a visa or being removed from Australia. The decision making process which resolves their applications will be codified in this Bill, instead of allowing the decision makers to rely on the rather vague notions of natural justice which have hitherto prevailed. Certain categories of people will then be entitled also to an independent merits review, including, notably, onshore refugee claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform Bill makes a technical change in the way applications for protection as a refugee are dealt with. In future claimants will not apply separately for recognition as a refugee and for permission to stay in Australia. Both processes will be combined in an application for a protection visa. They will be entitled to consideration by the Refugee Review Tribunal, which will operate in much the same way as the IRT. The IRT, being non-adversarial and normally excluding lawyers, has gained considerable public credibility and praise for its simplicity and the ease with which it is accessed. The RRT should do the same, having a similar format. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extending merits review should in itself reduce the number of cases going to the Federal Court. It is important to take this step because of the increase in the number of onshore applicants seeking political refugee status, and hitherto the delays, as I have mentioned, that have been experienced in processing these applications. This number may well be augmented in the future by an increase in the number of people seeking that status who arrive by boat on the northern shores of Australia. This does deserve our consideration; although,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to call this problem a crisis is exceeding the fact by a considerable margin. But a number of problems have been encountered in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these people have taken an inordinate amount of time to lodge their formal applications&mdash;in some cases up to 18 months. It has been widely feared&mdash;and I believe the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) mentioned this in his second reading speech&mdash;that they have been encouraged to delay in this way by advice from Australian citizens for whatever reason. I must say that, during an inspection of a detention centre in Darwin last year, I came to a similar conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They then become too readily the objects of apparent human rights campaigns, wherein they may become party to political campaigns designed to impede or control public decision making through appeals through the media, which have considerations other than the lawful process. During 1992 we witnessed far too much of this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applicants for political refugee status should apply promptly on arrival, and in return they should be dealt with quickly and fairly. Political refugees must be granted asylum quickly in this country if they are granted political refugee status. Those who are judged not to be political refugees should also be dealt with quickly and, if necessary, returned to their country of origin. In this respect, the Government's policy in removing on 30 October the 113 people who came to Australia from China by boat was a model action. It will deter persons who think they can readily queue jump into Australia by, for example, using relatively modern vessels, sophisticated satellite navigation systems, and a short cut to Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also deter racketeers in the place of origin, who have received considerable and quite warranted publicity in our media. But it should not affect genuine political refugees who have a right&mdash;and I should repeat this&mdash;to our asylum against persecution. Therefore, we will have a refugee processing system under this reform Bill that is clear, predictable, fair and quick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that people&mdash;and this should be said again and again&mdash;arrive by boat on our northern shores or on our island Territories does not automatically make them refugees. That is a decision that is determined by other processes. They must go through the same process as someone who arrives by plane or any other mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform Bill contains an integrated package of amendments which would codify for the decision makers the processes by which they grant or cancel visas. It would greatly expand the availability of determinative merits review, and it will ensure that the judicial review of migration decisions is available only on grounds which take into account the special nature of decisions on the status of non-citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the more general migration area, the Immigration Review Tribunal will handle the expanded case load that will no longer be able to go to the Federal Court for reasons of the changes taking place in this Bill. We need to remember at all times that over two million Migration Act decisions are made each year by officers of DILGEA. Uncertainty exists concerning what is required to make a legally valid decision, because of the uncertain content of natural justice, or procedural fairness&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;as that concept has evolved and continues to evolve in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform Bill provides for a code for decision makers, and decision making, to replace the current common law rules of natural justice. This reform Bill provides for codified procedures which will apply to all decisions made under the Migration Act in relation to the granting and cancellation of visas. This Bill sets out the legal requirements governing the making of applications. As noted above, the codified procedures to be established by the Bill will replace common law rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. This is taking codification a step further through a system which has been in the process of codification since the 1989 reforms. The Bill extends the current merits review regime in Australia so that there are broader merits review rights for decisions which affect the capacity of a non-citizen to remain in Australia. In certain instances, the President of the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Immigration Review Tribunal may be able to seek guidance from the AAT. But it is expected that, while only a small number of cases would be so referred, these may be of assistance in setting up the benefits of a judicial legal interpretation without the disadvantages of delay and expense presently associated with court appeals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AAT review in such cases replaces the IRT and the RRT and is, therefore, not another layer of bureaucracy for the applicant. There will also be provisions for judicial review rights where merit review rights are exhausted or not available and codified decision making procedures have not been followed. An applicant will be able to appeal to the Federal Court if the codified procedures and criteria have not been followed by decision making. But a court appeal will only be permitted where the appellant has first pursued all merits review rights. Removal from Australia would then be by force of law, rather than as a result of a decision. A person will become subject to removal as soon as he or she becomes unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of these amendments is to simplify the removal process so that all persons unlawfully in Australia will be subject to removal from the country. The Bill provides that non-citizens unlawfully in Australia will be liable for the costs of their maintenance, detention and removal. But the Bill also contains a power to waive such costs, which can be exercised by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing this reform Bill and changing these processes, this Government believes that it is moving to a better balance between natural justice and the speed of processing&mdash;although the balance between these things is always subject to controversy and reasonable argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by pointing out that, while establishing the Refugee Review Tribunal will cost about $3.2m in 1992-93, it is expected that the savings as against the present rather lengthy processing system could be as much as $72m during the next four years. This is a Bill designed to improve our processing systems, and I recommend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the Migration Reform Bill this afternoon I would like to answer a few points raised by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), who has now disappeared. Nonetheless, I shall answer some of the points raised in his speech. In particular, his harping on the word `crisis' reminds me very much of a Supertramp album back in the 1970s which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crisis? What crisis?</EMPHASIS>. In answering the assertion by the honourable member for Adelaide that there is no crisis, let me point to a couple of statistical matters. He raised the example of Germany being a country which is having a refugee crisis. I think the Germans have made that point perfectly clear. In fact, the Germans are now suffering some substantial social dislocation as a result of the refugee crisis within their frontiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Germany has in the region of 800,000 refugee claimants, having arrived there between 1990 and 1992 in an almost uncontrolled fashion. That matter was reported upon in the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The 800,000 refugee claimants who arrived between 1990 and 1992 represent around one per cent of the overall population of the now combined German nation of approximately 80 million people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the Australian case. Australia is a nation which, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has already remarked, has a coastline all around its frontier, and it should reasonably expect to be in a much better position to control its refugee influx. Australia currently has 21,700 cases awaiting determination and, in addition, of course, there are the 17,000 students from the People's Republic of China. That comes to a little under 40,000 people. Taking the ratio of those people to the overall total of the Australian population, they represent about a quarter of a per cent. So the Germans have a problem which is about four times worse than the Australian problem in that context. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, I was in fact talking to the Bill and, of course, to the second reading amendment which has been seconded by me. I think it is entirely consistent with the point I have been making that the loss of control in the refugee determination system is symptomatic of this loss of policy direction on the part of the Government in relation to migration and refugee matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter has been commented upon by the honourable member for Calwell. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 September stated that the Chairman of the Caucus immigration committee, the honourable member for Calwell, said that the Government was allowing the coalition to set the agenda on immigration policy. I happen to agree with that. I think that is entirely true. He also accused the Government of not doing enough to differentiate between its own policies and those of the coalition. He cited as evidence of the Government's departure from its traditional stance its decision to cut the migrant intake severely this year, its Budget measure denying migrant access to unemployment benefits until six months after entry, and its introduction of an English language test for some migrant categories. I understand that he is also bitterly disappointed and has complained about the Government's failure to curb its outspoken backbench immigration critics, most notoriously Senator Walsh and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out that this is not the only spat within the Labor Government in relation to differences in policy positions. I draw the attention of the House to comments made by one of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I might add that Senator McKiernan, the author of those comments, had a spat of his own with the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke&mdash;the person responsible in the first instance for what I consider to be the corruption of the refugee determination process by his emotion-ridden, emotion-laden unilateral decision to allow the PRC nationalist students to remain in Australia until 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 30 September that Mr Hawke, who was overseas when the report of the Committee was released earlier that month, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the commitment should not be withdrawn. He also rejected criticism that the decision to offer sanctuary had been ill-considered and emotive. The article, by Mr Mick Millett from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, went on to say in relation to Senator McKiernan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I think Mr Hawke is wrong', Senator McKiernan said. The commitment has got to be reviewed. There are 17,000 reasons why it should be reviewed. It has caused a big furore in other ethnic communities. They are claiming that if the Government can do it for the Chinese, why can't it do it for the Bosnians and the Sri Lankans, whose plight is demonstrably worse.</PARA>
<PARA>Need I say any more? That is strong evidence of strong policy differences among the Labor Government's immigration and refugee spokespeople and supports the contention in item 1 of the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Dundas that the failure to control the refugee determination process commenced with former Prime Minister Hawke's decision on the Peoples Republic of China nationals in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of any refugee determination program&mdash;certainly one being run by a humanitarian and rational nation&mdash;is to provide a fair system of determination, not to provide special categories with special rules that would cause others who might have an interest or who might be in the refugee determination queue to feel that they have been unfairly dealt with. It also contributes to a general perception in the community about the overall migration and refugee program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, as the Minister would well know, I have a large number of people who have migrated to Australia&mdash;just as I did&mdash;and whose relatives or friends have applied for immigration to Australia. I know that these are separate issues, and I would not for one minute pretend that they should be determined on the same grounds. However, the overall perception is that somehow there is an unfairness, that somehow there seems to be partiality on the part of the Government in relation to special criteria. In particular, as has already been pointed out, that unilateral decision by the Prime Minister went a long way to causing a substantial deterioration in the standing of the Government's migration and refugee program within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of an electorate where there are large numbers of people who have migrated to this great country, I find that a matter of come concern. Of course, a large number of them come to my office and make representations to me that somehow they have been unfairly treated. We know that by and large the system for assessment of migrants is essentially a fair system. Clearly, the use of objective tests of the eligibility of applicants for the receipt of a visa to migrate to Australia is a good thing. That is something that any reasonable person would support wholeheartedly. The reduction of the opportunity to use political or other types of influence to influence the outcomes is a good thing also because it allows those decisions to be made in an atmosphere of fairness and impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is, of course, that the decision made by Prime Minister Hawke about the PRC students to a large extent undermined the standing of the policies within the community, and I think a lot of people, particularly in my electorate, were troubled about exactly which direction the overall program was going in. When we tell people that unfortunately their relatives or friends have failed to meet the quite high standards of eligibility requirements to migrate to Australia, sometimes it is very difficult for them not to believe that somehow they have been unfairly treated. I think that is one of the fundamental reasons that there must be an overall image, an overall perception, of fairness. Of course, one of the key elements in that process of fairness is the speed with which the refugee determination process takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see this face-saving exercise here at the front table between the Minister and the Chairman of the Joint Standing committee and the Caucus committee, who has just walked into the chamber&mdash;presumably as some sort of exercise to show that there has been a reconciliation between the two. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three customs Bills before the House this afternoon. The first, the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, deals with proposed amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. The proposals contained in the Bill relate, firstly, to amendments to these Acts to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to Customs of information relating to the reporting, screening and clearance of cargo and to permit limited on-line computer access to such information by other specified agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals also relate, secondly, to amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to improve waterfront security in accordance with recommendations of the joint review committee which examined the 1989 report of the National Crime Authority on port security; thirdly, to amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to extend eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme to vessels servicing oil and gas operations in the North West Shelf and Timor Gap exploration areas when those vessels travel to and from Australian ship repair yards for repairs or refits; and, fourthly, to amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to effect minor technical changes consequential on the introduction of the electronic lodgment reforms to the import entry regime in Act No. 34 of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill 1992 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 propose to amend the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 as part of the legislative package announced by the Government. This introduces a new system for the imposition and collection of dumping and countervailing duties. The Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill provides the mechanism for the determination of interim and final duties, as well as introducing the two means by which subsequent adjustments of duty liability can be effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last sittings, as part of Act No. 89 of 1992, this Parliament passed legislation which reduced the total time allowed for the processing of anti-dumping and countervailing applications to the preliminary finding stage to a maximum of 125 days. I think everyone welcomes that measure. It extended to five years the period for which anti-dumping and countervailing measures remain in place. It has also made provision for a review to be undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority following a request by an interested party as to whether measures should continue after the five-year expiry date. It extended the life of the Anti-Dumping Authority to August 2001 and introduced a number of technical changes to facilitate the processing of applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, goods are said to be dumped if the export price of the product is less than the `normal value'&mdash;that is, the comparable price for the like product in the domestic market of the exporting country. Anti-dumping action is taken only if it is established as a result of inquiries undertaken by Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority that goods have been dumped and that the dumping is causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to point out in the brief time available that Australia has the best anti-dumping measures in the world. I seek leave to table a chart which shows the differences between Australia, the USA, Canada and the EC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that in our regime there are 125 days in which countervailing measures can be put in place&mdash;a total of 245 days; in the USA it is 280 days; in Canada it is 261 and surprisingly in the EC, which is very protectionist, the total number of days is 390. That is amazing and I am quite staggered at that. It is important that we reiterate that fact. There is no doubt that there is a lot of confusion in Australia regarding what is dumped product and what is product simply being sold in Australia. I guess all of us who are patriotic have said that products coming in and competing with our own industries, particularly from Europe, are dumped products. We do not necessarily mean that they are being dumped in GATT terms but that the products are simply being sold into Australia. To highlight and to identify what is dumped we have a mechanism, which is GATT related, to ensure that proper and fair play takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been criticism regarding the timeframe involved. The Opposition has said that it would reduce the timeframe quite dramatically. The real problem I have with that is not that there is anything wrong with shortening the time, if it can be effective, but that it is like telling a police force that it has only a certain number of weeks to catch a bank robber. The problem is that we need a certain period in which to ensure that there is a case to proceed. That period is now 25 days. There is a further 100 days for Customs to bring about its initial findings. The Anti-Dumping Authority then has 120 days after that. If we shorten the time, in many cases we make things harder and disadvantage the Australian company or product that we are trying to protect through anti-dumping measures. There needs to be a balance between the shortest and most effective time and a time scale that allows Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority to do their job. As I have said in previous debates on such Bills, I congratulate the ADA and Customs on doing an outstanding job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area there has been a lot of criticism about snow peas being dumped in this country. To my knowledge there has not been one application lodged by any rural group or processor against snow peas coming into this country. Unless an application is lodged no-one can expect the Government or any instrumentality to take action. It may be the case that snow peas are being dumped; it may not. However, the avenues are there. Customs now has shopfronts and that is a great innovation. I congratulate the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) on that and for making Customs more accessible. Companies and individuals are able to go in, gain the information that is necessary and, if they see fit, lodge an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to point out what constitutes dumping. I have an anti-dumping guide that has been provided by the Australian Customs Service, which is good reading for all politicians and people in the community. The guide stipulates that material injury is what it is all about. I noticed that in a pamphlet which the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) has put out&mdash;in fact, it is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">GST guide for canegrowers&mdash;</EMPHASIS>the Deputy Leader has made some claims about material injury, about tightening the material injury criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter from Senator John Button to the Comptroller-General of the Australian Customs Service clearly indicates that all the concerns that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has raised have been addressed. I will not read out the letter, but it is good reading and is there for all to read. It may well benefit the Deputy Leader of the National Party to read that. He may have been in error simply by not being aware of those facts. It is also important to recognise the comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">GST guide for </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">canegrowers </EMPHASIS>that we have to lose 20 per cent of our domestic market before anti-dumping measures can be implemented. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's current policy does not even allow an application to be made against subsidised sugar coming into Australia until our producers have lost at least 20 per cent of the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not correct. In fact, it is total and utter nonsense. It does not help rational debate to make such silly statements and send them all around Australia. I understand the pressures that are on the National Party, particularly with tariffs are coming down, and the fact that it is trying to hedge the issue when speaking about anti-dumping. This pamphlet from the National Party is confusing. Again it is inaccurate because it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariffs mean nothing to the European Community and some Asian countries and even if Australia increased its sugar tariff, any country wanting to get sugar into Australia would simply lift its export subsidy to override that tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason the only way we can guarantee that sugar from countries which subsidise their producers or exporters cannot be dumped in Australia is to have much tougher and quicker anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have already commented on the fact that if the process is made much quicker it can actually harm the case for the Australian product. Another point to make is that tariff has another mechanism&mdash;I am sure the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) recognises this, even if the Deputy Leader of the National Party does not&mdash;and that is price support. A tariff is a price support mechanism. It is totally different from anti-dumping. While the Deputy Leader of the National Party might not understand that, I can assure the House that every cane farmer understands that a tariff is a price support mechanism. That is why they are so vocal in wanting to keep it. It is totally separate from the issue of protecting the product, or the sugar, from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the ensuing few weeks, the Federal Government will assess the committee of inquiry that I am chairing into the tariff. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) will watch with great interest to see what recommendations are brought down and what action the Government takes. Those opposite will have to remain in suspense for a few more weeks&mdash;perhaps two or three weeks&mdash;before a decision is made. I make that distinction between tariff and anti-dumping because there is a massive distinction. At present a tariff of $55 a tonne applies to sugar and the sugar industry would like to keep that. I am sure that if the Deputy Leader of the National Party told sugar growers that shorter anti-dumping time frames will be as good as that tariff, he would have difficulty convincing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the time constraints in debating the legislation, I conclude by supporting the Bills and congratulating the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs on the way in which he has pushed through these changes. I also congratulate the Australian Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority on the way in which they administer their organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to confine my remarks this afternoon to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill. My colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has already addressed the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill. Before I commence my remarks I would like to place on record again my concerns about the limited time given both to the coalition and industry to consult and to study this Bill. There is a pattern emerging over the years of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) not introducing Bills into the House in sufficient time to allow both the coalition and industry to study them, address their impact and develop a considered position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that I was advised back in August about the impending introduction of the Bill, I can only conclude that in leaving it so late and giving us so little time, the Minister is either a very bad manager or else is playing some sordid political game. Either way, it is at the expense of both the democratic process and the efficiency of the customs industry as a whole. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus Bill which makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill comprises three main elements. It also includes a number of minor amendments of a technical nature. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill. However, I would like to make some comments about each of the major initiatives being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Bill provides for the introduction of a cargo automation system. To this end, it puts in place the legislative framework for the electronic transmission of information relating to the reporting, screening and clearance of cargo brought into Australia via air or sea. The Bill also gives limited access to this information to Australian port authorities and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. The proposed cargo automation system is the third element in the Australian Customs Service program of improving and updating the customs entry facilities for imports and exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two components, known as COMPILE and EXIT, were supported by the coalition. There have been some teething problems with COMPILE, such as out of date profiles and incorrect assessment classifications of goods. Indeed, many honourable members would be aware of the recent problems, where a loophole in the COMPILE system failed to detect the hypothetical arrival of potentially hazardous products. A customs broker has advised the coalition that some 31 consignments of potentially hazardous products which should have been quarantined for checking had technically been allowed to enter the country. Nonetheless, and in spite of these teething problems, the coalition is generally satisfied that both the COMPILE and EXIT systems are working well and are of considerable benefit to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I put the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs on notice that we are carefully watching the refinement of COMPILE. If, once complete, it does not satisfactorily resolve the problems I have outlined, we will not hesitate to raise the matter again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present arrangements, airlines, shipping companies and other freight forwarders manually provide Customs with a report of cargo to be discharged at Australian ports in advance of the arrival of that cargo. This information is then screened against various Customs profiles, including those to single out prohibited or dangerous goods. Once cleared, the importer is given an authority to deal, which allows him to collect the goods. Given that cargo manifests can be up to some 200 pages long and must often be produced in triplicate, the current cargo reporting procedure is lengthy and cumbersome. It is also very costly to both business and the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Bill will correct this by allowing cargo information to be transmitted electronically to the Australian Customs Service. The assessment of this information against COMPILE profiles will be done electronically. Accordingly, the new regime will reduce the paperwork burden on carriers, give importers faster access to their cargo, and reduce the cost to both cargo carriers and importers. The Australian Chamber of Shipping has noted these benefits. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that ACA (Australian Cargo Automation) when fully implemented will generate substantial savings to all participants with the added benefit of greater customs and quarantine control. This will mean faster import clearance, hence cheaper clearances and improved protection from illicit goods and quarantinable product.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome these benefits for the industry. Indeed, in these hard economic times and with record business bankruptcies, I welcome any measure which will reduce industries' costs and make them more competitive. That is what the coalition's Fightback plan is all about&mdash;removing costs from business&mdash;but unlike this Government, which throws meagre crumbs of assistance at business, we will undertake meaningful reforms in this area by abolishing $20 billion worth of taxes on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cargo automation system will allow Customs to react more quickly to changing information and maintain effective risk assessment and management. Again, any measures which enhance community protection are also welcomed by the coalition. Port authorities will be provided with limited access to the data on incoming cargo in order, firstly, to calculate wharf charges and, secondly, to facilitate the collection of statistics. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service will also be given limited access to cargo report details to allow for the detection of possible breaches of the Quarantine Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine Inspection's service charges are outrageously high. As such, they impose further considerable cost burdens on business. The coalition hopes that the efficiency gains made through electronic transmission of data will be passed on to customers in the form of lower charges. As I mentioned earlier, in these tough economic times, business needs every break it can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was pleased to note that the Bill provides for security of information and minimises the possibility of fraud by putting in place a comprehensive security network. I was also pleased to note that the Bill puts in place a contingency mechanism for use when the computer system is down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of this Bill implements a Budget announcement in respect of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Specifically, it proposes to extend eligibility of the scheme to include those ships travelling to and from Australian ports for repairs or refits. This measure is particularly targeted at vessels engaged in servicing oil and gas operations off the West Australian coast, including the North West Shelf. Currently, those vessels have the option of having repairs or refits undertaken in either Singapore or Australia. However, because diesel fuel taken on board is Singapore is at the international price, which is much cheaper because it does not include Australian excise, many ships elect to have their work undertaken in Singapore. Obviously, this is at the expense of our own ship repair yards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment is intended to remove the disadvantage suffered by Australian repair and refit yards by reducing the cost of Australian diesel for those ships travelling to Australian ports for repairs. I point out that the coalition will abolish the diesel fuel excise lock stock and barrel. Under a coalition government, consumers will save 19c a litre on petrol and diesel, while businesses will save a substantial 26c a litre. Under our plans businesses will not need to fill out cumbersome forms to get the rebate, nor will they suffer cash flow problems while they wait for a refund. Most importantly, under our plans, struggling businesses will not be held to ransom by disgruntled public servants working to go slow and delaying repayments. Honourable members will recall that I brought to the attention of the House last year the adoption of a go-slow tactic by Customs officers in Tasmania and the devastation which it was having on a Tasmanian logging contractor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes amendments to improve waterfront security by requiring persons in customs areas to produce satisfactory identification upon request by a Customs officer. Satisfactory identification is defined in the Bill as being identification issued by an employer&mdash;such as a ships master&mdash;a passport or some other document containing name, photograph, address and date of birth. These amendments are the result of a joint review committee established by the National Crime Authority to examine port security. The committee noted that the inability to control or identify wharf visitors and waterfront workers hindered barrier enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already pointed out that the coalition welcomes any measures which will enhance protection of the community. I mentioned at the outset of my remarks that the coalition will not oppose this Bill. However, we do take the opportunity to draw attention to the high costs which this Government has imposed on business and its reluctance to undertake any meaningful reforms in the wake of the worst recession in 60 years and nearly one million people unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has failed absolutely in its approach to manufacturing industries and to ensuring the survival of a decent and proper manufacturing base in Australia. The headlines of Australian newspapers deal with closure after closure. I take honourable members back only 12 months ago to the closure of Carringtons. Maybe people have forgotten that great shipyard. It is now closed&mdash;forced into receivership and sale, resulting in the loss of great skills, great abilities and the loss of a most effective Australian shipbuilding industry. Recently we have seen Nissan decide to take its plant offshore and other car companies making rational decisions to sack people or to contract their businesses to a smaller scale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this period of failure in this recession `we had to have', the Government made a conscious policy decision to jack up interest rates and bring down tariffs&mdash;a recipe for certain failure of Australian industries. The Government has put a competitive demand on Australian industries which it has been impossible for them to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government in effect has done is open up Australian shops and stores to imported goods because of reduced tariffs. By crazy cost structures the Government has made it impossible for local manufacturers to compete. Part of the goals of the Kennett Government is to see that Australia is competitive. If we can judge the results in New Zealand, where similar contracts and labour relations already exist, 96 per cent of salaries have actually stayed the same or have increased. The other 4 per cent are unidentified&mdash;that makes 100 per cent&mdash;and are contracts that are so complicated that neither union nor employer group can assess whether there has been a rise or a fall in actual salaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one State government&mdash;following the example of the New South Wales Government&mdash;seeks to make changes which will benefit employees and which will make Australia more competitive it is castigated by the Government that has brought about the closures and the recession. It is a height of hypocrisy both from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his Government to behave as they have towards Australian manufacturing industries. The recession that we had to have has bludgeoned Australian industry to death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we belatedly have the second part of a change to anti-dumping legislation. It is a natural follow-on because if there is going to be appropriate removal of protection the international cheats need to be stopped. That is, those people who would take advantage of wiping out Australian industry by using false subsidies or falsely priced goods to undercut Australian manufacturers, thereby putting more of them out of business and gaining complete access to the market for themselves. Having destroyed their opponents, they then come into the market and range supreme. It seems to have been the Government's objective to preside over this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was the first to decide that something should be done and so the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology took this issue up and looked at the anti-dumping procedures. Belatedly, Senator Button and the Government decided something ought to be done. The Senate Committee looked at the whole range of mechanisms under the anti-dumping procedures and came forward with an invaluable report for the Parliament. But long before that it should have been the Government's role to take an initiative and to understand that its policy was crucifying Australian industries by forcing people out of work and causing closures. As my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has said, the Government has caused record unemployment and record bankruptcies as industry after industry has lost important elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great cry out there in the Australian manufacturing industries at the moment is, `We won't survive until there is a change of government. We can't hang on'. Those industries are looking at a week by week process as to whether they can keep their doors open. Victoria is just like a scorched earth desert with all the landscape and trees destroyed. Driving through Dandenong, that great manufacturing heartland of Victoria, one sees factory after factory with empty car parks or with only two or three cars in those car parks. People are just offering a care and maintenance basis only to those great manufacturing plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government goes on belatedly taking steps to rectify some of its crazy policies and crazy decisions but with no incentive, no understanding of the totality of what is needed for a dynamic, effective, competitive Australian manufacturing industry. What the Government did was to reduce tariffs by a flick of a pen which is an easy thing to do. It is an administrative process for the Parliament or the Minister. It has no effect anywhere else. It does not mean any hard work in getting down and talking to people in manufacturing industries to try to solve some of their cost of employment problems, their cost of component problems, their cost of raw material problems, the cost of transport problems and the cost of the infrastructure that they have to put up with. None of that is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of electricity alone is criminal in some areas of Australia. Victoria has treated some of its great manufacturing plants in a criminal way with what it has done in order to falsely subsidise the private consumer. I have no problem with the consumer being subsidised, but it has jacked up the price of electricity to major manufacturers to a point where it is an intolerable overhead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the policies of this Government and its counterpart governments in the States working to destroy Australian employment capacity all for the mad, ideological sake of trying to keep an accord in place and trying to remain friends with the leaders of the union movement. It is an impossible regime that recognised belatedly that the international cheats will come into the Australian market and try to knock off Australian industry by falsely subsidised or falsely priced goods. Therefore, amendments are needed to the anti-dumping legislation. The coalition is not opposing the current second leg and, as the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments represent the final change to Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing provisions which were announced by the Government on 5 December 1991 following a review of anti-dumping policy and administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a great shame because the Government is nowhere near finished in this area. Today we have heard members of the Government quoting Australia's excellent record in these areas and comparing the time scales that are available to Australian manufacturers in order to bring dumping cases. I notice the Minister put out a statement that was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Focal Point</EMPHASIS>, which is the Government's propaganda rag that goes around the place. I do not know who reads it, but in it I picked up the Minister's claim that we have now got one of the most dynamic and forward looking&mdash;the adjectives which pour out of this thing are completely false&mdash;processes in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one comes to analyse the anti-dumping processes that the rest of the world uses, the time factor is basically irrelevant. In an excellent presentation given by Brian Gallagher from the Australian Customs Service here in Parliament House on Australian anti-dumping processes and on other competing or relevant countries, he drew comparisons between Europe, the United States and Australia. He clearly set out the fact that in America and in Europe the time scale factors do not mean a thing because there are so many other mechanisms in place. I quote from that address where Mr Gallagher uses an example. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As J. Michael Finger, from the World Bank, and Tracey Murray, a professor of the University of Arkansas, indicated in an article in the August 1990 edition of the Journal on World Trade:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Petitioner's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a petitioner for anti-dumping&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">interests are served by any outcome or influence that will disadvantage his competitors. A formal anti-dumping duty order is only one of the ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In drawing this conclusion, Finger and Murray referred to the lack of success of dumping and countervailing applications that I mentioned above, but pointed out that in nearly half the 774 cases lodged between 1980 and 1988 the desired result for the domestic industry was achieved by negotiated, or `voluntary' export restraints.</PARA>
<PARA>The hoops that people have to jump through in order to import goods into the United States are considerable and they include: the way in which charges are applied, the way in which the process of damage is assessed, and the bonds that are placed on goods. These make it quite incomparable with the factors that the Australian Government has been espousing. The Ministers in the Australian Government need to do a bit of study about what the rest of the world is doing. They are so naive in their approach to these matters that one wonders whether they in fact really understand what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's claims about Australia's approach to anti-dumping are grossly exaggerated, as are his claims in his second reading speech. One of the key factors that could still be implemented without going into the mechanisms adopted by the Europeans or the Americans, and something which the industry is currently crying out for, is a more expedient hearing of the process so that industry can get a decision as to whether there is dumping. The drawn-out, legalistic, crazy approach that we have had, which has changed slightly under the Government, but needs to go further&mdash;without becoming protectionist&mdash;is obvious. A newsletter put out by the KJC organisation entitled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Report</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recently revised Australia's anti-dumping system and Senator Button announced the outcome of the review in the Senate on Thursday, 5 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike the Coalition's proposals, however, the Government review failed to come to grips with the real issues of concern to Industry in combating unfair trade&mdash;and in particular with the need for prompt and effective remedial action when dumping/subsidisation occurs.</PARA>
<PARA>The real issue is the time factor. The coalition proposes that there should be a big change in the time factors. That is what the industry wants. Industry needs to know where it is going. It needs certainty. The Government, step by step, has first of all created a great chaos, a wrecking of industry, and then, belatedly, tried to apply changes to anti-dumping processes, without recognising the full scope that is needed to effectively deal with these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a complete package. Yes, we believe that there should be a run-down of protection for Australian industry. Yes, we do believe that it is possible, unless that is done, for people such as Halfpenny to grab every bit of extra protection as unjustified wage claims. Australia has been in a vicious cycle in which wage claims jack up tariff protection, which jacks up wage claims, which jack up tariff protection. That is the way we have gone on. It is time to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is going to remove tariffs, it must give some incentive support to the industries that it is exposing to world competition. That is where our complete package comes into real life. We will provide an incentive by removing $20 billion worth of taxes currently applied to industry. Industry will have the advantage of the payroll taxes, the wholesale sales taxes and those other five taxes being abolished, amounting to $20 billion worth of support to Australian industry, plus strong anti-dumping processes, to put a bottom in the whole thing so that the cheats do not get in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has moved in a certain direction, but the thing that is lacking in this anti-dumping area to conclude the process is a speeding-up of the hearings. It is our proposal that within five days we can establish whether or not there is a case to be heard and within 60 days we can give a determination; then there is a review period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) are the Government's final step, initially announced on 5 December 1991, to introduce a new system for the imposition and collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties. For the first time, interim duties will be collected on each importation of goods that is subject to anti-dumping measures. To the present, it has been relatively easy for exporters of products dumped in Australia from other nations to raise the price to a normal level for that country and, hence, to try to avoid dumping duties in Australia. These new provisions will make this avoidance procedure much more difficult, as interim duties will still be payable even if the export price increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill's most important feature is probably that it places an onus on the importer, who might have interim duties imposed on him by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), to show cause why any excess duties should be repaid. A number of industries and farmers have been very keen to bring this about. Everywhere we have gone around the country, people have been advocating this. The coalition is pleased with this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is different from putting the onus on importers to ensure that imported goods are not dumped. Neither Australian law nor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade condemns dumping, as such. A company can seek action against dumping only if there is material injury. Again, there is a considerable amount of conflict on the definition of `material injury' as it affects local industry. If this were not so, consumers would lose by not having cheaper goods available, as would many industries which use the imports as the basis for their manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping cannot be proved by just having cheap goods; they must be cheap goods causing more than an insignificant level of damage in market share to the producers in Australia. I support the Anti-Dumping Authority's interpretation of the criterion for anti-dumping action, as noted in its 1990-91 annual report as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dumping, of itself, is causing or is threatening material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods to those which are being dumped or is hindering the establishment of such an industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, `like goods' is a matter of some debate. Dumping claims are always contentious. This is emphasised by the eight out of the 43 proposals investigated by the Anti-Dumping Authority between July 1991 and October 1992 in which the Anti-Dumping Authority disagreed with the initial findings of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way these reforms are being implemented by these Bills is in accordance with GATT and also with the way in which the European nations, as well as the USA, deal with the problem of dumping. If an Australian Customs Service inquiry now finds that there is a difference between the exported price of goods from another country and their normal price, the margin will be the interim dumping duty. Should the export price fall further, that difference will also be collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that there is no re-emergence of the failed doctrine of protectionism, which was referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). It calls for a monitoring of imports to ensure that they are not being dumped, and will not solve Australia's chronic balance of trade problems. The evidence before the Anti-Dumping Authority is quite strong. Some industries can suffer from much greater contractions in demand from other sources than the level to which they are affected by dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vinyl floor sheeting industry was a fairly recent example. Although information available to Customs showed that the sheeting had been dumped into Australia from the United Kingdom, there was no evidence of material injury available to either Customs or the Anti-Dumping Authority. This was because the Australian market for the product fell by 16 per cent between 1987-88 and 1989-90, but the dumped exports from the UK fell by 26 per cent, and other imports, which no-one claimed were dumped into Australia, rose by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, many people would have said, `Yes, the vinyl sheeting industry has been hurt', but when the figures were examined some other cause apart from dumping, such as the Prime Minister's recession we had to have, was the major cause why the industry was not performing as it previously had. I support the shadow Minister in our coalition's position that the important thing is the timetable of the dumping procedures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I hope he does not mislabel anybody on this side of the House in that way because we understand healthy competition very clearly: we understand it absolutely. We did not all come from the various rabbit burrows of the ACTU or from academia.

We will be making a productivity increase in regard to these procedures, and we do not believe that we have got to the fastest position now. It is just a tragedy that the Government has not had the courage to increase the pace of these procedures, and we can go to a far foreshortened one, or a series of them, as I said a minute ago. We will improve those procedures further by coming close to halving the timeframes required for anti-dumping and countervailing duties action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank my colleagues in the Opposition for giving me the opportunity to sum up in the second reading debate on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2). I want to address particularly the issue of time, because I think it is fair to put on record what is the reality rather than the objective. The objective of the Opposition of 60 days is a noble objective that cannot be achieved. If we are going to comply with GATT, we must give 30 days for all parties to register submissions. Under GATT again, there must be seven days to allow for delivery of all documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's proposal allows a total of 60 days. That means there would be 23 calendar days left for the Australian Customs Service to make sure of its preliminary finding. That means that we would have to get Customs officers overseas to undertake normal values in a 23-day period. What in effect would happen under that Opposition proposal is that we would have continuous negative findings because of our obligations under the GATT. In effect, that extends the process to 165 days. There was some criticism that this proposal had taken so long to come into effect. In fact, the previous anti-dumping regime&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had some histrionics in the House of Representatives in the last couple of days. It seems that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regards our policies as being designed to do to Australia what he has already done to Australia, but tomorrow we are back to reality because then there will be some unemployment numbers coming out. They will be bad news for the Government, and reality will come home to the Prime Minister when these new and tragic unemployment figures appear. In a couple of weeks there will be more bad news for the Government because the national accounts figures will be out. They will almost certainly blow out of the water the assumption of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) of a growth rate of 3 per cent for the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Government has created an unfair society. We now have more than one million unemployed. We have a growing number of people under the present Government's policies who are unemployed for life. We have large numbers of unskilled or poorly educated young people who have little or no hope of ever getting a permanent job, and we have another bunch of people who, although employed, are terrified that in the course of the next year or so, under the present Government's policies, they will lose their jobs. One family in four has no employed parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments are relevant to the Qantas Sale Bill, firstly, because the Qantas sale episode is an example of the Government slowly and reluctantly following coalition policy. For five years now we have said that the ownership of Qantas should be transferred from the public to the private sector. We have been belted by the Government on that issue, and were accused of `stealing the family jewels' and all this sort of stuff by the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer. But now slowly and reluctantly the Government has adopted our policy. It has adopted our policy in violation of its own Party policy. It is not Labor Party policy to privatise 100 per cent of Qantas; it is Labor Party policy to privatise only 49 per cent of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments are relevant to the Qantas Bill because we have an example of a Cabinet, of a Prime Minister and of a Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who are unable to keep to a schedule. It is an example of ministerial incompetence and an example of how to keep an economy under sedation. The people who are really suffering from this incompetence are the unemployed. The jobs that might have been created by a revitalised Qantas have been lost or delayed. The investment that might have created more jobs and increased national productivity has been lost or postponed. Four senior Ministers have been responsible for this: the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). The senior Ministers on the Government front bench have been responsible for this Qantas sale fiasco. That Government front bench is so tired of office that it has had to fight the next election on our policies instead of attempting to resolve the economic difficulties that it has created. Instead of implementing policies to pick up the recession that we had to have, the Government is trying to put the focus on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of attempting to resolve the economic difficulties that it has created, instead of implementing policies to pick up the recession that we had to have, the Government is trying to put the focus on us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of participation in the ownership of Qantas by the employees is an important one. The Minister made a glancing reference to it in his seconding reading speech in relation to previous discussions, yet he passes up the opportunity to enshrine in this legislation a mechanism whereby the employees could participate in the ownership of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to the coalition and to its industrial relations policy that employees are put in a position where they can participate in the ownership. Under our industrial relations regime and under our workplace agreements, we would envisage that negotiations between employer and employee would lead to a situation where the motivation for the employees was greater as a result of their having part ownership of the organisation, or in this case the enterprise, in which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This oversight, this failure to include in the legislation a provision for employee ownership, arises because essentially the Government is treating privatisation as a money-grubbing exercise. What the Government wants out of the Qantas sale is money&mdash;just money. It does not care about the wider benefits of privatisation. It is not using this privatisation to create a more competitive framework. It is not using this privatisation to subject Qantas and its management to forces associated with the financial markets and the share markets. It is not using this privatisation to encourage employee ownership in Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has even failed to spell out in the documents associated with this Bill the extent to which there will be a broader spread of shareholding in the community. It is simply treating this as a money-grubbing exercise. The reason it is doing that is that it has some real difficulties with its Budget deficit. It will have even more difficulties if, as we expect, the Government does not complete this privatisation by 30 June 1993. The real reasons for privatisation, and the ones that the Government has failed to grasp, are increased efficiency and productivity, reduced union control, easier capital raisings and, most of all, more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other comments that the coalition parties would like to make on this Bill. I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he make a public statement as soon as possible, spelling out the entire program for the privatisation of Qantas, so that the employees can be in a position to determine what they want to do, so as to assist those associated with advising the Government on the way in which the Qantas shares will be publicly listed, and so that the share markets can adjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Minister for Finance that the Government should amend the Bill in the Senate in two other ways. It should be amended to make it clear that the Government can at any time use the Qantas organisation or assets for national security or defence purposes. The second thing that I suggest to the Minister is in the context of clause 7(1)(f). There should be some modification to that clause. As I understand it, Qantas flies to Taiwan under the name Australia-Asia Airlines. If it continued to do that, it would be demonstrably in breach of clause 7(1)(f), so some modification needs to be made to the Bill to ensure that Qantas's interests are protected in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister for Finance will amend the Bill in the Senate in respect of those two matters, he will have the coalition's full support when it comes back to the House of Representatives&mdash;not only full support but, because this matter has been raised by the coalition now, we would not need to detain the House for any length of time in discussing those two matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude my comments in order to give my colleague the honourable member for Fadden a chance to speak on this Bill given this absolutely disgraceful guillotine that is sitting over the top of us. Jobs are what privatisation is all about, and jobs are what the privatisation of Qantas should be all about. Unemployment and jobs are what the next election will be about. The Prime Minister will get a startling reminder of those facts when he reels before the unemployment figures tomorrow. The coalition parties welcome the Qantas Sale Bill 1992. It has long been our policy to privatise Qantas. Despite the shortcomings associated with the management of the privatisation, we are glad to see this legislation before us, and it has our support. </PARA>

The measure we are discussing today will be in the interests of Australia, in the interests of Qantas and its employees and, more importantly, in the interests of the Australian travelling public. They are the reasons that this Minister deserves full credit for negotiating this proposal through some rocky waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker was critical of the proposal we are negotiating because, he claimed, it is in breach of the ALP platform. When he makes criticisms like that he tempts me to compare the Labor Party's processes of working out these issues with those that apply in his own Party. Of course, a Liberal Party national convention has all the power of a Tasmanian CWA meeting in seeking to bind the Liberal Party to policies which it should pursue. That is why more people who attend those Liberal Party conventions spend more time at the balls and the afternoon teas than they do seeking to argue and persuade delegates in negotiating the policies which might be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister interjects that that is nonsense. How much consultation was there amongst Liberal Party members, or even the Parliamentary Liberal Party, to introduce a 15 per cent consumption tax? We all know that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), perhaps with some consultation with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), decided what that proposal would be and how it would affect all the different sectors of the Australian economy. There was no consultation with the Liberal Party's parliamentary party, no discussion at the Liberal Party national conference, or the National Party conference for that matter. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that during a recent Queensland National Party forum there was some criticism of the impact that proposal would have on tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), to criticise the Labor Party for the way we go about consulting our membership and giving our membership a say in determining our Party's policy on Qantas and other issues really shows a great deal of hide on his part. Nevertheless, my Party believes that there should be some private ownership in Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government set out on this journey it intended to sell only 49 per cent of Qantas and keep 51 per cent in the hands of the Australian Government. People may well ask: why did the Government decide to sell more than the 49 per cent of Qantas originally proposed? The reason, I think, goes back to the three aims which I believe are behind this Bill: is selling more than 49 per cent of Qantas in the interests of the Australian community; is it in the interests of Qantas and its employees; and is it in the interests of the Australian travelling public? I think it meets each of those three conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has introduced some very radical changes in the Australian aviation industry. It has made the historic decision to open up a trans-Tasman aviation market. Negotiations with New Zealand have already resulted in more competition in that trans-Tasman market. I believe we have set out on a journey which will ensure that air fares throughout that trans-Tasman market will remain quite competitive for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 November the Government's decision to allow Qantas to fly domestically came into effect. Perhaps members of the public in the gallery have already seen some of the advertisements which Qantas has placed in the newspapers advertising cheap air fares. I am sure that Qantas will be offering those very competitive fares for many years to come, because it can fly Australians at relatively cheap marginal cost. That is another measure that is good for the Australian travelling public. In the not too distant future there will be an increased number of flights by Ansett. Perhaps one day there will even be Compass flights travelling internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those measures are quite radical. I think the Minister for Finance was responsible for one of the most important decisions for Australian aviation: the decision to allow Qantas to purchase Australian Airlines, to allow those two airlines to amalgamate. I believe the combined organisation has the capacity to make substantial savings in the total cost structure of that combined entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), would certainly be aware that the management of both Qantas and Australian has been doing a lot of work on ways in which to rationalise operations and reduce costs for the combined entity. That is a proposal which I think will improve&mdash;that is, lower air fares for the Australian travelling public and allowing the combined entity to remain as competitive as possible with other international airlines. We all know that the large American airlines&mdash;United, Continental and others&mdash;when seeking to sell international air fares through their companies offer very cheap additional sector flights throughout their own domestic networks in the United States. It has been unfair that Qantas has not been able to attract tourists to Australia away from those airlines by offering cheap air fares on the Australian domestic market. The Minister for Finance is the Minister responsible, with a bit of help from the current Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), for making sure that that amalgamation has taken place so well and so quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may still be one or two members of the Labor Party who have some doubt about this proposal to sell 100 per cent of Qantas. There are two reasons that we have a great deal of affection for Qantas and a great deal of affection for not only the airline but for the people who work there and the commitment they have to the airline and Australia. There are two main reasons that I think it is in their interests and the interests of Qantas and Australia for this sale to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason is that if this sale did not take place Qantas would face a great deal of difficulty because of the debt to equity ratio it now has. To be able to remain competitive Qantas has had to buy aircraft which are extremely expensive. I think a jumbo jet these days costs over $250m. If Qantas is to maintain its reputation as a carrier with some of the most up-to-date aircraft, then it has to borrow a lot of money to ensure it can remain competitive with other airlines flying into and out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, Qantas has a very difficult debt equity ratio. If the Government were not prepared to sell any shares in Qantas, then the Government would have to face up to a major capital injection of the order of perhaps $1 1/2 billion. That would be $1 1/2 billion which would have to come from rail and road capital works projects, increases in pensions which are due next January or other measures which those of us on this side of the House believe are required to give the economy a boost and provide greater equity in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would strongly oppose a Labor government seeking to divert funds from social programs so that a Japanese tourist flying from Tokyo to Kingsford-Smith Airport could be in an Australian government owned airline instead of an Australian owned airline. I do not think the tourist would care whether it was a government owned or an Australian owned airline. That is the first reason why members of the Labor Party strongly support this proposal to sell 100 per cent of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why I think it is important is that it is in the long term strategic interests of Qantas for it to have a strategic shareholder which offers it support in international aviation negotiations for air traffic rights. That might be an argument in favour of two of the bidders rather than the third, which is not a large player in international scene. I believe that certainly there is the potential for that strategic shareholder to be able to offer some support to Qantas in future negotiations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the education of the shadow Minister, let us take a theoretical example using British Airways. If British Airways is successful in bidding for a strategic shareholding in Qantas then it would have a vested interest in Qantas remaining profitable. If Qantas is applying for additional air traffic rights into the United Kingdom&mdash;which is where British Airways often has a fair amount of say&mdash;then that would mean that that airline would have an extra person on that side of the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member is not aware of such a scenario, I refer him to the fact that Air New Zealand was able to negotiate very favourable air traffic entry rights into Japan because JAL, in addition to Qantas, was a shareholder of Air New Zealand. Because there was a Japanese shareholder Air New Zealand was able to use that strategic shareholding to help increase its chances of getting a favourable outcome.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very interesting interjection and it shows the Opposition's real agenda on this. The shadow Minister believes that if British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand or someone else is allowed to own 25 per cent of Qantas and that helps Qantas, then we should allow that other airline to own up to 100 per cent of Qantas. The Opposition's view is that there should not be any limits at all on what the foreign strategic shareholding should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the Government and the Opposition part ways. We believe that Qantas should remain an Australian airline. We believe that it is important to protect Australia's national interest through&mdash;what we call&mdash;the golden share. That allows us to guarantee that there will not be any more than 35 per cent overseas equity in total. It guarantees that the name Qantas will always be there and that Qantas will not have its name changed to British Airways, Air Kangaroo or some other name. At the same time, the golden share guarantees that the head office will remain in Australia, that the main operational bases will be in Australia and that the majority of directors on the board will be Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That golden share is embedded by legislation into the Articles of Association. In the unlikely and unhappy event that there is a Liberal government elected at the next Federal election, it could only allow 100 per cent of Qantas to be sold to foreigners, to move offshore, to change its name, or a majority of overseas directors on the board by altering the Articles of Association by trying to amend the Act. That would require legislation to pass through both Houses of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very unlikely and unhappy event that the Opposition wins the next election, I believe that it is extremely unlikely that it will control both Houses of the Australian Parliament. This will ensure that it will not be able to allow, as it has indicated tonight, 100 per cent of Qantas to be sold to foreign persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised at how few criticisms the Opposition had of the proposal. Oppositions being oppositions have to criticise, but I had hoped that it would have come in tonight and in a spirit of bipartisanship congratulated the Minister on negotiating this proposal through these very troubled waters. Perhaps the next speaker will congratulate the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first speaker for the Opposition was critical that there is nothing in the legislation which provides for an employee shareholding in Qantas. That was one of the major criticisms he had of the proposal. It is quite clear that he is not aware that the Minister for Finance, from the very outset, has made it clear that it would be a condition of sale that there be an employee share ownership scheme. That is another reason why he should be congratulating this Minister and not seeking to criticise him. The scheme does not need to be in a legislative proposal, and the Minister has made it clear that that there will be employee share ownership scheme as a condition of sale. The reason the Government believes it is a good thing is that it will help encourage productivity and, I am sure, a greater commitment on the part of the employees of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, I believe that this proposal is not only good for Qantas and its employees but also good for Australia. It is going to be good for the air travelling public. It is a proposal which was negotiated through some pretty troubled waters and it is a credit to this Minister that this has been negotiated in such a manner that Australia's interests have been protected and the interests of Qantas as a whole have been protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be forgotten that Qantas has been criticised by one or two members of this House in days gone by. The next speaker has made some strenuous criticisms of Qantas and has argued that we should not be as protective of Qantas as we have been. I think it is fair to say that if Qantas had its way it would have preferred that the Government had not made the radical changes it has made to aviation policy by introducing the trans-Tasman single aviation market. This allows Qantas to fly domestically, the domestic airlines to fly overseas and quite a few new air routes to be opened up and negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done this because it is in the interests of the Australian tourism industry. Each year we set new records for the number of international tourists that come to Australia and spend money in Australia. This helps create jobs in Australia. This has been one of the great success stories of the 1980s. A lot of credit is due to Qantas, Paul Hogan, John Brown and many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a great worry to all of us who have watched the tourism industry in Australia grow so quickly and create so many jobs that the Opposition has a proposal which threatens the viability of that industry. It is a proposal that will result in overseas tourists having to pay a new 15 per cent consumption tax when they make purchases of goods and services in Australia. If members of the public in the gallery are choosing between a holiday in Fiji or a holiday in Cairns, then there will be a new 15 per cent tax on that holiday in Australia; a new 15 per cent penalty on doing the right thing and trying to create jobs for Australians. That is why I can understand their concern about these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have made clear, we on this side House will be doing all we can to ensure that that does not take place. We are very pleased that the Minister has been able to bring this proposal to its fruition. I am sure it is in the interests of Australia, Qantas and the travelling public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made a number of intelligent contributions to this House. Unfortunately, his contribution today was not one of them. I must say that he is fairly wide of the mark in terms of his interpretation of some of the great aviation policy initiatives that we have had from this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy is that this privatisation of Qantas is happening in 1992-93, and not in about 1975 or 1976. As one who advocated the privatisation of Qantas in 1978, I am pleased that the process is finally starting to come to fruition&mdash;although none of us really knows exactly what we will have at the end of the day when the time limit of March 1993 comes up. That will be fascinating. The most fascinating part is that the Opposition parties, who will then be in government, will be left with the mess. It will be fascinating to find exactly what in fact is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite fascinating if we go back to 1990, to that very big dispute within the Australian Labor Party and the special conference about the privatisation of Qantas. A little over two years later we are in the House now addressing the whole business of its privatisation. In the last two years we have seen the demise of the Soviet Union, we have seen the split of Aeroflot&mdash;and, in fact, we have already seen great chunks of Aeroflot being privatised. But not here. We are taking as long as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say lightly that the worry is that we are probably too late. It does not matter what government it was, of what particular colour; Australia really started to miss the boat in the development of international aviation during the early and mid-1970s because it was at that time that there were massive changes happening in world aviation circles. Qantas had been part of that whole British Commonwealth group of international airlines. Honourable members would remember those old pink parts on the world map and the air routes which linked them. There were cross-arrangements between Qantas and BOAC, as it was then, and Air India, South African Airways and the other major players. That started to break up and we then saw an emergence of the ASEAN carriers. That is where we did not learn our lesson, and that is where we were caught. It was at that time, when the ASEAN countries were starting to emerge, that we should have been making some very definitive changes to our whole approach to aviation. Indeed, that was the time when we should have seen the proper capitalisation of Qantas so that the right expansion could take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) smiles, but which are the world's four most profitable airlines? British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Thai International. British Airways is a 100 per cent privatised airline, making a very real play on the requirement to have a staff shareholding in that particular operation. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) was spot on: we must make sure that within a privatised Qantas we have maximum staff shareholding, because that is all part of the secret. That is all part of the success of British Airways being able to get where it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Singapore Airlines has government money in it, but there is also a very large private sector holding. We know of its tremendous successes. Singapore Airlines is now at the point where it goes off to the Boeing Corporation and pays cash for brand new 747 400 aircraft. It has only about 60 on order at the moment! Along it goes to Seattle with its bag of money and says, `What's the best deal you can do for cash?'. While airlines such as Qantas have had to negotiate some pretty torrid deals for their aircraft acquisitions, that advantage in itself has put Singapore Airlines a long way ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathay Pacific&mdash;which is, of course, part of the Swire group and is basically very much a privatised airline&mdash;came in with profits in excess of $400m last year. Thai International, which is undergoing a privatisation process at the moment, is also one of the most highly profitable airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as I say, the early and mid-1970s is really when the changes should have been made. We should have been getting out of that protective cocoon of the old British Commonwealth routes and made changes. We should have got Qantas set up with a proper game plan and with proper planning, and perhaps then we would not have the financial difficulties that we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make reference to one quote that the honourable member for Dobell made in his contribution tonight, and that concerns the opening up of the Tasman. Obviously, under the CER arrangements, the Opposition is very much in favour of that. We would want to see that transpire to its nth degree as soon as we possibly can. It is fascinating that part of the One Nation project was, of course, to make sure that that was all opened up by the end of the year. I was going through the One Nation statement earlier today and I saw that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the time said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expects that Australian and Ansett Airlines will be operating across the Tasman by 1993 at the latest.</PARA>
<PARA>He does not have long to go. I really wonder what is going to happen there and whether we should not be looking at moving a little faster in opening up that whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dobell was talking about strategic alliances&mdash;and obviously there is an argument abroad that if we can get some of that foreign investment in place, it can be strategically helpful&mdash;but when the time comes and the bidders come up to the gate, and on the assumption that the British Airways-Air New Zealand combine and Singapore Airlines are the bidders, what in fact will happen if we do not have the buyers there, or if the amount that is offered for those private stakes in Qantas is not acceptable to the government of the day? We know, as the honourable member for Bruce mentioned, that this is very much about getting some money into play for the $7 billion extra in the Budget last year, but in reality we do not want to sell short on Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties we could well have is that, if we accept those lower bids, the whole of the exercise could be devalued. So it could well be that, when we get to that particular time, we may have to have a look at another whole new process for the privatisation of Qantas. Qantas itself is talking about an absolute public float. Maybe that is right, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, it is interesting that the prime player has to have 25 per cent. It has been put to me that, if we are going to reduce the holding to that size, we may be better off taking it down to 20 per cent to give some institutional investors a bigger slice of the action. That might push up the value in that trade sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of this debate is simply the fact that one of the most significant pieces of aviation legislation in this House for many years is under guillotine and we are constrained by the time. In the last couple of moments that I have available to me, I just raise with the Minister a couple of areas of this Bill that cause us some worry. My colleague the honourable member for Bruce made reference in particular to the situation regarding the national defence requirement, or the emergency requirement, with Qantas. Under the old regime Qantas did not have that requirement. One probably can do it with a golden share. It was interesting, for example, that during the Gulf War the Americans moved all their troops into the Gulf states from the United States using civilian airliners. That was under the acquisition provisions that apply in the United States for private airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bruce also mentioned the Australia-Asia airline that operates into Taipei. He referred to the Qantas Sale Bill. I refer to clause 7 (e) and (f) under part 3 of that Bill. Under section (e) the explanatory memorandum says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qantas' company name must not be changed to a name that does not include the expression "Qantas".</PARA>
<PARA>I think we need some clarification of that because that Taipei market is an expanding market and there are some tremendous opportunities there. I would hate to see any access to that market diminished purely because of an oversight in that Bill. The other one&mdash;and this may be a long bow but I think it probably needs clarification, too&mdash;is under that same clause of the Bill, but in subclause (f). It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qantas must only conduct scheduled international air transport passenger services under its company name or under a registered business name that includes the expression "Qantas".</PARA>
<PARA>What would happen, for example, if the buy were undertaken by Singapore Airlines and if, at some stretch of the imagination, Singapore Airlines convinced the company that it may be better to act as a megacarrier and perhaps paint the Qantas aircraft in Singapore colours? Does the legislation allow that, even if we have `Singapore Airlines' all down the side of an aircraft with a tiny dash and a tiny `Qantas' on the side of it? I just wonder whether there should not be more emphasis on that to make sure that the flying kangaroo is still well and truly displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is just about up. The Opposition will not be opposing these particular Bills. We would like to see this process completed as soon as possible. It is not the Opposition's intention to sell 100 per cent of Qantas to overseas interests because that is physically impossible under the international aviation regime. There are requirements that state that when it comes to bilaterals there can be no more than a 35 per cent foreign ownership of airlines. In fact, in the case of British Airways in the United States when its foreign ownership actually hit about 37 1/2 per cent, the company was in a few difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I would like to see in a future debate is the development of the issue which has been raised by the honourable member for Dobell about what happens after the privatisation if there are no overseas bidders, or if we do not accept the overseas bidders and the opportunity of perhaps developing our own megacarrier in the south-west Pacific. That would require looking at what the future may hold for Air New Zealand and perhaps the Pacific Island airlines. </PARA>

Indeed, I will be moving on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to the second reading motion condemning the Government for this failure and for the bureaucratic and centralist approach which it has taken to training through its so-called national training agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of a national framework for vocational education and training is essential. Employment opportunities and international competitiveness are dependent on a work force with skill levels of international standard. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard in his seminal book on the competitive advantage of nations states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt from our research that education and training are decisive in national competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it is crucial if this country is to have a national framework for vocational education and training that it should be a framework of the appropriate kind. I had occasion to speak in an earlier debate today about the way in which the Government has totally neglected the central issue of schooling&mdash;that is, the quality of learning that young Australians are achieving. In that debate I pointed out how the Government has been distracted from this main mission to raise the levels and standards of learning of young Australians onto other agendas by its preoccupation with numbers and by the concerns of its friends in the teaching unions for nationally uniform awards and their willingness to approve only changes and reforms which do not threaten in any way their position within the education or industrial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the same story has been repeated with equally damaging results in relation to vocational education and training. Here again the Government has dropped the ball very badly, while chasing an agenda which has much more to do with the industrial relations objectives of the ACTU and its desire to inflate as far as possible the influence of the trade union movement in industry than with ensuring that young Australians have access to employment related vocational education of an international standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there are a number of milestones which mark the progress&mdash;or perhaps one should say regress&mdash;towards what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) now admits is Australia's `training emergency'; a phrase used by the Prime Minister in announcing the Government's intention to establish this authority. These milestones stand out quite clearly and I thought it might be of value to the House if I were to remind honourable members of some of the steps along the way which have brought Australia to this training emergency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter that I think all honourable members will be aware of is the decision of the Government to destroy the colleges of advanced education as institutions focused on high quality, advanced vocational education. When this Government came to office in 1983 Australia had an outstanding system of colleges of advanced education&mdash;a system established as a result of the initiatives of earlier coalition governments and a system in which there were strong institutions, other than universities, focused on the issue of vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, under the influence of college unions and in a sustained attack on the so-called elitism of the universities, he decided that all the colleges of advanced education should become universities. In doing so, Australia lost a very large number of institutions which had established strong regional links and had developed courses which were appropriate to the vocational needs of students in the region and tied in particularly with local industry. These institutions were told that from now on they were to become universities and assume the university model. The results of this have been quite tragic in a number of regions of this country. The Government started out with a very strong foundation in the area of vocational education and it threw it away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Government have to say about TAFE? I am sure honourable members will recall that TAFE had been the recipient of a very significant series of policy initiatives from the previous coalition Government which realised that there was a need to build up technical and further education. The Fraser Government invested very heavily in this sector of education and training in the latter part of its term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor came to office in 1983, it had a TAFE system which had made significant advances, was flexing its muscles and offering a wide variety of courses to students&mdash;a system that was growing. What happened under this Government? The system effectively ground to a halt. There was not a role for TAFE in the vision that the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training had. He was too interested in the universities and in pulling them down and teaching them a thing or two to worry about what was happening with technical and further education. As a result, the demand for university places was pumped up. TAFE was neglected and there was a declining interest in TAFE among precisely those young people who would have benefited from undertaking TAFE courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of this chamber will be appalled to know that in the last two years the number of teenagers in TAFE has fallen by some 33,000&mdash;a drop of 12 per cent&mdash;at a time when this Government says it is committed to building up technical and further education as an alternative to university education for young Australians. After 10 years of Labor, TAFE, sadly neglected by this Government, has lost its appeal to young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another milestone along the way to the training emergency was the report of the Kirby Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs in 1984 which led to the establishment of the Australian traineeship system. The traineeship system was an attempt&mdash;and one must admit this&mdash;to provide an alternative entry point, apart from apprenticeships, for young people into industries and occupations where formal training and entry level training had been non-existent. A target of 75,000 traineeships a year was nominated by the Government. In the last two years, the number of young people undertaking traineeships dropped to 9,000. So much for the national target of 75,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Australian traineeship scheme, a scheme relying on employer subsidies, simply did not work. Of course this is a grave embarrassment to the Government. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) treats us regularly in Question Time to an update on the number of young people undertaking traineeships on a monthly basis because he is very concerned by the fact that this scheme is widely perceived in the country to have failed. He wants to show that there remains some interest. But despite the increase in numbers, the fact remains that there has never been any approach to the target of 75,000 a year for this scheme under the Government. It was an initiative which simply did not get off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that over the last two years of the recession apprenticeship intakes fell by 35 per cent. So a government which is promoting the concept of the clever country has to face up to the sad and very regrettable fact that the number of places in vocational education and training for teenage Australians fell by some 36,000 over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along the way the ACTU got interested in training. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS>, based on a mission to Sweden, outlined how the training area could be a whole new territory for the centralised industrial relations system to invade&mdash;how training could be a magnificent opportunity to help promote further the power of union officials on whom the Government has become so dependent. In 1988 and 1989, the Industrial Relations Commission at last made the link in the national wage case that the ACTU had been waiting for and it formulated the structural efficiency principle which linked wage increases to evidence of training or other workplace reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Training Board was established with the specific task of approving standards for industry training agreements as part of the award restructuring process. The National Training Board is specifically a part of this agenda. As is well known, however, this process also has been exceedingly slow to achieve very much. I do not say that nothing has been achieved, but what has been achieved falls a thousand miles short of what is required to boost productivity in this country to the levels that we need to become internationally competitive. That is the ultimate and the real test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report which Ivan Deveson brought down on training costs noted&mdash;the report was commissioned by the Government&mdash;how little had been achieved through the award restructuring process and how Australia was `back of the pack' internationally in its training effort. Mr Deveson also warned that training must not be allowed to become enmeshed in the industrial relations system, which is precisely where the Government and its mates on the ACTU want it. What they want is to develop a rigid and bureaucratic system in which qualifications will be linked into award structures and linked to payments and promotions. They want the training system to be an extension of the system of industry unions and industry-wide awards, administered nationally by central bureaucratic agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this agenda were to succeed in becoming, as indeed it aims to be, the national training agenda, the effect would be quite disastrous for Australian industry. This system will reinforce the rigidities of the present industrial relations arrangements and be a further incubus on the back of Australian enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the Finn report. The Finn report talked about something that the Government was most uneasy to have talked about, and that was the very serious deficiencies which young Australians are exhibiting in their employment related competencies. Quite simply, the Finn report concluded that there is overwhelming evidence that very large numbers of young Australians are emerging from the schooling system with literacy and numeracy standards which simply do not fit them for employment in internationally competitive industries and many find themselves unable to get jobs at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we had the Carmichael report, which proposed a system for making sure that the training standards identified by the National Training Board and the industry training advisory boards under it are locked into a system of certifications and come to control and dominate the courses at TAFE and among private providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority, provided for in the Bill, is to be the vehicle for implementing the Carmichael agenda, once it is established, and to service the industry training advisory boards. Presumably this agenda will be reflected in the national strategic plan for TAFE, which will be developed by the Authority and will become an important element in whether or not a State's TAFE profile is approved for growth funding. Is that profile in conformity with this industrial relations training agenda?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `presumably' because that is doubtless the Government's intention. Whether it will be the intention of those who are appointed to the Australian National Training Authority will be another matter. They can, if they wish, exercise a degree of independence in their judgments. If they do so, I have no doubt that they will be running into some difficulties because there is a mighty juggernaut behind this national training agenda and it will not easily be deflected. I have no doubt that this agenda poses a major challenge to those who have accepted in the public interest positions with the National Training Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the concept of a national system of certification for training. However, we have serious concerns over a system of certification which is to be based exclusively on industry standards. Where industry standards which are appropriate to all enterprises within an industry can be developed, that is a good thing. But the driving force of national prosperity is not the industry, but the enterprise. The ACTU may want its members organised on an industry basis, but the key thing is the productivity of the enterprise. It is vital that the enterprises of this country are not locked into training frameworks which force them to pay for training they do not need, into training frameworks which discourage innovation in training at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has so far failed totally to face up to the need to ensure that training arrangements are suitable for a system based on enterprise bargaining and with a strong enterprise focus. We hear the rhetoric, but we do not see the reality. There is also a risk that industry defined competency standards may come to inhibit the development of high quality training because they require providers to jump through a set of prescribed hoops which may not be appropriate to the needs of particular trainees or particular enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are tremendous pressures, within the training bureaucracy which is being established, for uniformity. Uniformity means bureaucracy and uniformity means mediocrity. There are very real risks that this National Training Authority will have forced on it an agenda which is not the training agenda which this country needs if it is going to move towards international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge public investment in the committees and boards which make up the current bureaucracy. Some $15m is spent on the industry training advisory bodies, but what have been the productivity gains of this expenditure? Ultimately, of course, that is the test. If we are going to spend millions and millions of dollars on this agenda, the public is entitled to know what contribution it is making to the productivity of Australian industry. No country has implemented such an integrated and bureaucratic system of training as is proposed through the Carmichael report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this year, of course, on the part of the Government a prolonged period of confusion. There has been a great deal of sound and fury with the Prime Minister in the threatening mode typical of the New South Wales Right, indicating that the Commonwealth might walk in and take over the State TAFE systems or set up its own. In its desperate search for an initiative before the election to show that, in the Prime Minister's blatant admission, it is doing something, anything in the training area, it has finally come up with the proposal embodied in this Bill. The Australian National Training Authority is the compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the key questions are these:  will the Authority be an effective vehicle for encouraging the development of a national training market responsive to the needs of industry, or will it become a new source of rigidities and bureaucracy in the training area?  Will it contribute to the development of a national training system which will be flexible enough to have an effective enterprise focus, or will it persist with the Government's approach of compulsory industry based standards which may or may not be appropriate to the needs of the enterprise? There are also significant issues of accountability around this body. It operates between the Federal and State levels, not at either level, and is reporting to an institution which is not itself an accountable institution to any parliament in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to register the Opposition's concerns over a number of aspects of this legislation. There are some obvious absurdities. The States are required to pay to this Authority their own purpose funds for TAFE and then they are guaranteed by this Bill that they will receive these funds back again. So, the Authority is to act simply as a post box. There is to be a costly process of administration involved and nothing is to be achieved. The only explanation for this that one can come up with is that there is a hidden agenda here, that there is the desire for the Commonwealth at a future time to make it clear that these funds are no longer the State's funds, that they are the Commonwealth's funds, and that they will be directed according to Commonwealth policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another unsatisfactory feature of this legislation&mdash;its dual system for hiring staff. It may hire staff independently under agreements or it may hire staff under the Public Service Act. That is a strange provision within the legislation. It was intended, presumably, to cover the fact that employees from the present Department of Employment, Education and Training may well flood across to the new Authority, but the provisions in the Bill go beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the development of State training profiles. Each State is to give to the Authority a profile of its training plans and if the Authority likes these plans, it will provide the State with growth moneys. This system of profiles has failed completely at the university level. It is not an effective system for planning the university system and it is most unlikely to be an effective system for planning the development of the technical and further education colleges in this country. Indeed, it is a system which has a real danger in it on the one hand that it will lock the TAFE systems into a uniform framework when what we need to see is developments in the direction of greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very interesting developments taking place in Victoria at the present time under the new coalition Government. The coalition is prepared to give the TAFE colleges the right to hire their own staff. It gives the colleges a good deal of autonomy and it provides for the colleges to be responsive in terms of their own policies to the training needs of industry in their area. It would be a tragedy if this Authority were to deprive these colleges of their independence at the very moment when the coalition in Victoria is very sensibly moving to give them greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our whole strategy is a very different one from the Government. The Government is still clinging to the separation of training from jobs. It is still relying on subsidies for employers to get them to take on trainees. It is still relying on centrally controlled labour market programs and it is establishing an Authority which may effectively seek to centralise control over TAFE. Its whole approach is centralist, and the fundamental reason for this is the ACTU's agenda. We do need a national framework, but that framework should concentrate on providing for national certification, ensuring that this is flexible, so that training with an enterprise focus and excellence in programs for both public and private sector providers is encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition aims for decentralisation, not merely in relation to TAFE and not merely in relation to the encouragement of private providers; but also through the policy of community-based employment and training programs for the unemployed through local employment boards. There is a world of difference. The two programs are poles apart. This Authority is going to have a huge responsibility before it to act independently to ensure that we do get a national training market developed, and this is a great challenge for those who have been appointed to it.

It is hard to be clever unless one has had the appropriate training, and it is the job of ANTA to define and implement that training.

At no time during these years did the Opposition give any indication that it was willing to bite the bullet, willing to let Australia take its chances with the big players in the international market.

A community attitude embedded during the reign of successive conservative governments has seen TAFE, apprenticeships and traineeships as something one did if one was not too bright or did not cut the mustard at the private school, or did simply because mum and dad did not have the shillings or dollars to rub together to support one in long term education. </PARA>

It attempted to force the States to agree that, for some recompense by the Commonwealth, some additional funding to go into the national training agenda, the State training authorities would give up their control over their individual TAFE colleges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States propped, TAFE propped, and the State training authorities propped and said, `No, thank you very much'. So the Prime Minister tried it another way, as he was trying to win the hearts and minds of the Australian people. He said, `What we'll do is give extra growth funding to those States which agree to our agenda'. The States propped at that, too. They did not really want DEET to take over control of the training system as it has taken control of the universities. A compromise came about in order to be able to fulfil the Prime Minister's promise of an additional $750m over the course of this decade to be pumped into vocational education and training. The compromise is there purely and simply because the States wish to retain control over their own training agendas. Thank goodness for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA is a creature of compromise. I am not yet sure in my own mind whether ANTA will fulfil the high objectives that we all hold for it or become simply a vehicle for Laurie Carmichael's agenda of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. I do have hope that it will work, because the States have such a heavy involvement in the Training Authority through the ministerial council. Unfortunately, the voting system is loaded in favour of the Commonwealth, with two deliberative votes and one casting vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has control, and that is why the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) is so delighted that ANTA will be located in Queensland. I have no rancour against Queensland whatsoever&mdash;I think it is a terrific State&mdash;but the agenda of the vocational training system has truly been set by the Victorians. I give credit for the fact that it was set under a Labor Government. It was set by a group of individuals led by Ivan Deveson and consolidated with Terry Moran as Director of the State Training Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they have done in Victoria is create a series of more or less independent State TAFE colleges which operate, largely, on their own agenda, working together in each location with their industry towards trying to achieve vocational training objectives that will satisfy the needs of the marketplace at that location, satisfy industry's objectives for training in that area, and help improve the profile of training and the quality of output, as well as the number of students who are served by the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria is light years in front. As soon as Haddon Storey implements in Victoria the final aspect of devolution&mdash;that is, devolution of the industrial relations function&mdash;we will have in that State a series of more or less independent State TAFE colleges operating just like our independent universities have operated for decades, able to deliver off their own bats very high quality vocational and technical training courses which should be attractive to both the young and the mature student populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that all sides of politics agree that we have neglected the training agenda in this nation, and we have done so to our peril. I believe I have said before that the country in which I was born got it all wrong. It listened to the Chairman of IBM in the United States years ago, who said of the secondary school system, `If you will take young people and give them a good general education and teach them how to think and how to learn, we in industry will take those outputs and give them the specific training they need in order to satisfy our requirements in industry, business and commerce'. It flunked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That country has created a gigantic system of tertiary education which today means that a person damn near needs a diploma to get a job to pump gas or clean the streets. It has been highly unsuccessful. University graduates today are a dime a dozen and they number highly amongst the ranks of the unemployed. Australia needs a different agenda. I think everybody agrees with that. One of the things that we have not accomplished yet, which I am concerned ANTA will not accomplish, is to give status to the system. As the honourable member for Bowman rightly pointed out&mdash;and I give him credit for that&mdash;young people decades ago saw that vocational training was a second-class training, leading to second-class jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that selfsame reason, in Victoria at the beginning of the 1980s we closed down our over 100 vocational secondary colleges. These were vocational high schools that took young people and gave them, in addition to a broad and general academic education, specific vocational training in either highly technical subjects or crafts and trades. We produce carpenters, boilermakers, metalworkers and auto mechanics. The list goes on and on&mdash;from hairdressers to chefs and people in the hospitality industry. Unfortunately, over time&mdash;and I think driven by the teacher unions as an agenda&mdash;the public saw that as being second class, so we ultimately rejected it. In doing so, we implanted in the minds of our young people that training is somehow not as good as education, and that education is obtained from a university and training is obtained from TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to change that impression, because some of our TAFE colleges today, particularly those that are able to drive themselves on their own agendas towards excellence with minimal control under the State authorities, are really showing the way. They have courses now which are overloaded. They keep rejecting students by the tens and sometimes the hundreds. That is because they are seen in the community as providing an excellent product. We should encourage that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The place where it needs to start is out in the community. One way to encourage vocational education and training and technical training is to introduce a system in our senior secondary schools&mdash;in years 11 and 12 of high school&mdash;of giving those students who are not headed towards academia, who are not headed towards the universities, who are not destined to study English literature or Russian history, or to be doctors, scientists or lawyers, the opportunity to have a leg up into their real life's vocation where they can earn a good living and have a good life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can establish in our high schools&mdash;without going back to a system which failed, with vocational training being viewed as second-class education&mdash;these kinds of courses which lead to these new modern TAFE colleges running their own agendas, we will serve our young people better. The people in the country that I came from have served their young people poorly in terms of industry's needs and building a modern economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that Brian Finn will be the Chairman of ANTA, because I have a great deal of respect for him. His report was a major event in the history of vocational training in Australia. That report is what leads us to this agenda today, although it was preceded by a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the Deveson report, and other reports. I am not as confident about the Carmichael report. Whilst there are many things about the Carmichael report that read well&mdash;that is, about industry and the training authorities working together in cooperation to build the national agenda&mdash;I have some concerns that we will revert to bureaucracy and prescription. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted, I was talking about prescription. I would like to finish my remarks in that vein. Prescription concerns me. Without question we do need some kind of system to give us some cohesiveness and some relatability between States. There are people who would have us go back to the days when the Commonwealth was a minor player, and the States were the major players running the States rights issues. There are those who would have us get rid of the States, and there are those who would take a more moderate and in-between line. I suppose that I am one of the latter. The States are important to us in that they are certainly much closer to the people. They are closer to industry and they are closer to those who need the training than are the bureaucracies located in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that DEET, through the profiling process, has not served the universities well. I am confident that the universities would say that, whilst they have learned to live with the profiling process, it is heavily bureaucratic and it does affect, unfortunately, the way that the universities direct their own resources. This may be because of something a bureaucrat says, or because of the bureaucratic system itself. The inherent nature of bureaucracies means that those who respond to those bureaucracies wind up being caught up inside the system. I am concerned that ANTA does not become caught up in the same sort of bureaucratic nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the nonsense is inherent in one of the items that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) talked about today. He said that it is up to ANTA to deliver that training. I hope he is wrong. I really do. ANTA will not deliver anything. It is up to our TAFE colleges, our independent providers of vocational training, industry bodies and individual workplaces to provide the training&mdash;not ANTA. It should be a coordinating body. It should be able to take the best ideas from the best States, the best TAFE colleges, and the best industry training groups, and help to encourage other States and other parts of the sector to work towards what has proved to work well, and to offer excellence. ANTA should not deliver that training. If ANTA does wind up delivering that training, the system will fail and the people will desert it in droves. We have lived for a long time in Australia with our craft based industrial relations and training system. Most people on both sides of politics recognise that, while that system served us well in times past, it is no longer suitable for the dying days of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to move beyond the tight, confining prescription of craft and allow people to have more flexible work lives and more flexible training to allow them to do the jobs that will be available in a more enlightened and&mdash;if I might say so&mdash;enjoyable manner. It is no good saying to a plumber, `All you are allowed to do is to change tap washers and sit on your backside for the rest of the day'.

Many questions were posed as hypothetical scenarios requiring the application of knowledge and skills to real situations. These ranged from significant events in the relevant community in Australia, in the homeland or elsewhere. This gave applicants the opportunity to demonstrate programming and journalistic abilities rather than merely to reiterate learned "facts".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) No. The selection process which was negotiated with M.E.A.A. provided for a committee member who possessed an intricate knowledge of community demographics, issues and needs. SBS Radio obtained the cooperation of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs which provided officers to assess applicants' knowledge of the relevant language base community as well as their knowledge of government  departments and the services that they provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be some explanation as to the reason for the committee not including a representative of the relevant community. It is a reality that in many communities there are different factions or groups. During the previous restructuring process, there was the perception that an applicant may feel that they were disadvantaged or advantaged by the inclusion of a particular community representative. The SBS believed that, in order for the selection process to retain its integrity, it was necessary to eliminate this perception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes. A level of proficiency in a certain language is implicit. It is not merely sufficient to possess linguistic skills alone. Successful applicants must also be able to demonstrate that they possess broadcasting and journalistic skills. Where an applicant meets the criteria for a Broadcaster or a Journalist but fails the language assessment, then that applicant cannot be recommended for any position with SBS Radio as a Broadcaster, a Journalist or a Broadcaster/Journalist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Yes. As programs on SBS Radio are determined in accordance with language spoken not country of origin. For example, there are no Lebanese programs but programs in the Arabic language. Similarly there are no "Chinese" programs but programs in Cantonese and Mandarin. Therefore, the French language program "homeland" includes all places where French is spoken and includes France, Mauritius, New Caledonia, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hypothetical scenarios, which were developed at the interview, required the applicants to draw on their knowledge of homeland issues. It also ensured that those applicants without journalistic "ability" could not bluff their way through the interview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) No. The process was uniform. All applicants were questioned and assessed in the same manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Yes. In order to conform with established standards, SBS has a clear obligation to conduct selection processes and appointment of staff in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service "Streamlining Act 1986". Under the guidelines relating to this Act there is no provision for appeal against the appointment of a successful applicant to the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) (i) and (ii) In 1986 SBS Radio embarked on a restructuring process with the aim of employing professional Broadcasters and Journalists at SBS Radio 2EA and 3EA. In the following 18 months, 39 permanent  Broadcasters and Journalists were successfully recruited for 16 language groups at 2EA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a positive outcome. The recruitment process, however, was suspended in 1988 pending a reappraisal of the allocation of air-time. The motivation behind this was the need to make the schedules reflect the needs and expectations of the various linguistic based communities. The previous schedules were devised in 1979 to meet the information, entertainment and cultural requirements of Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures contained in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 are expected to reduce bankruptcy numbers. Mandatory income contributions for example, should discourage some from going bankrupt as an "easy way out" and encourage others to enter informal or formal (Part X of the Act) arrangements instead.

A bankrupt will be able to apply for early discharge at any time 6 months after the time when he or she files a statement of affairs with the Registrar. To be eligible for early discharge the bankrupt must have no or insufficient divisible property to enable a dividend to be paid; not have disposed of property in a transaction that is void against the trustee; and earn an income which is unlikely to exceed the actual amount on which his or her contributions have been assessed.</PARA>
