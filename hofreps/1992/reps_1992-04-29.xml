<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present this report on behalf of the Committee as the Speaker, yourself, who is the Chairman of the Committee, excused himself from these deliberations. On 16 October 1991, the House agreed to authorise the live television broadcast and rebroadcast of its proceedings and of the public proceedings of its committees. It also appointed a committee to consider and determine the conditions that would apply to television broadcasts, whether there have been breaches of the conditions and, if so, what penalties would apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions which were adopted were those set out in the report on the televising of the House of Representatives which was tabled in August last year. One of those conditions is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Points of order and matters claimed to be points of order are not to be rebroadcast.</PARA>
<PARA>That is condition 7. It was suggested to the Chairman of the Committee that an item in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of 2 April 1992 on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation breached the conditions. The members of the Committee have considered the suggestion and have viewed copies of the item. The Committee then sought comments from the ABC on the suggestion that it had breached the conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Manning, the controller of ABC news and current affairs, replied that the program's Federal political correspondent, Paul Lyneham, assured him that he&mdash;Mr Lyneham&mdash;had always sought to comply with the conditions for broadcasters. Mr Manning went on to suggest that Mr Lyneham would never contravene the conditions by rebroadcasting any material ruled by Mr Speaker to be a genuine point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr Lyneham would not appear to be fully conversant with the condition which prohibits not only the rebroadcast of points of order, but also `matters claimed to be points of order'. The item rebroadcast not one but six points of order, or parts of a point of order, and has definitely breached the conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions suggested penalties which may apply to breaches of the conditions. For a first offence, it is withdrawal of the service to the station for three days. However, to penalise the ABC because of one program would seem unfair. The Committee considers that withdrawal of the service to the program rather than the network is more appropriate. Accordingly, the Committee determined the feed be provided by the Sound and Vision Office to the ABC on the understanding that the feed is not provided to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> for three sitting days with effect from today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Televising has presented the Parliament with new challenges; it has also presented the television networks with opportunities to use footage of the proceedings. How the footage should be used is, in the main, for the program producers. However, the House has an interest and has set conditions. Those conditions cannot be ignored. It is with reluctance that the Committee has proposed the imposition of penalties; however, it had little option in this case. The Committee is prepared to discuss the guidelines and would welcome suggestions on the conditions rather than a disregard of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1992. This is a significant development. As the second reading speech of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) indicates, the purpose of the Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. This Bill involves significant restructuring of rail institutions, technology management and work practice. I agree that without such initiatives we will be unable to meet the community's current needs, let alone our future needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important transport reform. Transport affects almost every area of Australia's economic and social activity, and it is extremely important to those of us in rural Australia. As a significant immediate cost, efficient transport is vital to the competitiveness of our economy. The test for the Government, and indeed the Parliament, will be to ensure that the full ambit of reforms are proceeded with while not leaving existing transport systems isolated, non-viable or inoperable. In 1989-90 the Industry Commission estimated that a more efficient land transport system alone, including a more efficient rail system, could realise an additional $6 billion in gross domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributable to rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major reforms the industry must overcome is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard. In the main, this is due to the quality of the service that rail delivers. As the Minister's second reading speech states, terminals are inadequate; work and management practices need improvement; and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of our rail network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the Federal Government has positively promoted the revitalisation of the interstate freight rail system, and the coalition parties agree. This is part of a broader set of transport industry objectives within which each of the transport modes can undertake the task to which it is best suited. I emphasise, as the second reading speech emphasises, that it is not a matter of favouring one mode over another. What the Government should be striving for&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;is an integrated rail system that will provide the community with an efficient and competitive land transport system. Therefore, I hope that the Minister and his Government understand what this means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is highly dependent on road transport. It is imperative that no action be taken to impede road transport's operations. That rail can be a success in Australia has been clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth's own railway, the ANR Commission. AN has long practised the commercial approach that will be taken by the National Rail Corporation and its success is clear for all to see. The Industry Commission acknowledged this achievement in its recent rail report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the Minister in taking the opportunity to congratulate AN, its employees and management for the efforts that they have put in since its creation in 1978. Indeed, I expect that the skills and expertise built up by AN will prove to be a valuable asset for the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot, however, say the same about our State systems, which are fraught with outmoded work practices and undercapitalisation; they have a very low morale and are horribly in debt. I understand that the Australian-wide rail system lost $4 billion last year. It is well known in Victoria that the most profitable days that V/Line has are the days on which its employees are, in fact, on strike and the system is not operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth and all mainland States, except South Australia, signed an agreement establishing the National Rail Corporation at the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. This means that, for the first time, interstate railway freight operations will be brought under one management structure. The NRC has been incorporated under the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arms length from government. The directors of the company have to comply with all relevant provisions of the company law, including the obligation to act in the interests of all shareholders. The company has been established for the purpose of conducting interstate and rail freight operations on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major aspects of this agreement indicate that the company has to operate on a strictly commercial basis with a financially viable corporate plan and be subject to the Trade Practices Act. The company will have access to the assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve this commercial viability. It will operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award, which reflects best practice in productivity standards through efficient work and manning practices, determined by the technical capacity of its equipment and commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also have the capacity to contract out activities where that is the most efficient approach. The company will provide access on a commercial basis to the NRC network and to terminal facilities for both private and public sector operators. It will have the capacity to provide services to governments, with the charging for such services being on a strictly commercial basis. The company will not be responsible, financially or in any other way, for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and the transfer of functions and assets to it. It will be subject to all rates, taxes and charges, will not have the shield of the Crown and will be treated as an ordinary incorporated company. Any new rail projects undertaken by the NRC will be subject to normal State and Federal environmental legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a proposal warrants our support and the support of this Parliament. Such a standardised rail system is essential for Australia's economic and social well-being and should be supported. However, there are many concerns that I would like to raise today, particularly as they relate to the State of Victoria, and to my region in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 March a public meeting was held in the city of Horsham and the Chairman of the NRC, Mr Ted Butcher, attended. He gave an honest, blunt and concise explanation of his and NRC's charter. A number of very significant questions were answered. He clearly indicated that Victoria's State network would not be part of the Corporation's plan for a standard gauge national railway. He doubted that the intrastate system would offer a positive rate of return for the Corporation. He also dispelled doubts as to the route, indicating that it would follow the existing Melbourne-Adelaide line and be achieved by shifting lines from broad standard gauge. This, in itself, was a change from the plan the Corporation was originally speaking about in December: that the preferred route would be the most direct route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Butcher responded to many questions concerning the impact on our road transport system. He believed that the new freight system would halve the increase in road transport use. Current figures indicate that 10,000 vehicles travel this road interstate annually, with an increase to 20,000 by the year 2000 if rail is not improved. NRC calculations now suggest that this increase will drop to 15,000 if a new freight system is successful and B-doubles are operated effectively. The Corporation believes therefore that truck numbers will not reduce, but will increase at a slower rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise this Federal Government decision. Its economic statement is strictly a mainline strategy with uniform linkages for capital cities and some crucial regional areas. My concern, however, is for the future of Victoria's domestic network and, particularly, for the bulk freight lines including the Dimboola-Yaapeet line, the Murtoa-Hopetoun line and the Ararat-Portland line. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are important lines, and these lines, and others such as the Mildura and Swan Hill lines, are vital to the maintenance of our State's viability, and to the maintenance of our agricultural and horticultural sectors and all those industries that depend particularly on bulk transport for their operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must know the plans for these lines because we have learnt from bitter experience that any networks lost are not easily replaced and every loss reduces the viability of the total system itself. The two systems under the existing plans are incompatible. Mr Butcher, as Chairman of the Corporation, has a charter to which that Corporation must adhere, but this Parliament, this Government, and appropriate authorities in the States must urgently answer many more questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at rail transport as an integrated system allowing diverse freight and passenger options and not assess the performance of one line or mode of transport directly against the other. The Victorian Government must respond immediately to its plans for the maintenance and upgrading of the State's rail network to mesh in with and complement this new standardised system. The plan must tell us what portion of the line may be duplicated. Will triple lines be an option? What portion can be built by shifting one line? What will be the maximum speed given to the selected route? What, for instance, is to become of the passenger services on the National R<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>ail Corporation line? My preferred option for the three significant freight lines that I have already mentioned&mdash;the Yaapeet-Dimboola, Hopetoun-Murtoa and Ararat-Portland lines&mdash;is that they should be standardised. I believe this is the most simple and sensible proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is extremely important for the future of Australia. It is particularly important for the future of the State of Victoria where, as I have said, the existing network will be incompatible with the new standardised gauge. The harsh reality is that either the State Government standardises the State rail system now incorporating the main Melbourne-Adelaide line or many rural communities now dependent on rail must change holus-bolus over to road transport with all the implications that that brings. It is incomprehensible that a national rail authority, supported by the Federal Government and this Parliament, could embark on the national line without some complementary program to compensate for the resulting disruption in a State lacking the financial capacity for capital works on any scale. I support this legislation, but these questions require an answer, if possible by the Minister but more particularly by the State of Victoria which has a responsibility for ensuring that our rail system is adequate to meet the needs of future generations and future industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate on the legislation to enable the establishment of a National Rail Corporation. I want to say at the outset that almost a century after Federation we still do not have a truly national rail freight system. Rail systems and industrial arrangements have been State based and State controlled. The fact that State rail systems met at State borders has, in the main, been regarded as incidental to our Federation's economic interests. Development of an efficient, competitive interstate rail system has never been a priority of the several State railway systems. The fact that 91 years after Federation we still have three separate gauge systems and a multiplicity of management and organisational systems across the country is clear evidence of this. Anyone who has had to deal with the individual rail fiefdoms and the anachronistic system of State railway commissioners in the past is well aware of the burdens that their style of management, their objectives, their powers and their policies have imposed upon their employees and upon this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Railways have had a proud and loyal history. They have played a great role in the development of our nation, particularly in the earlier part of this century when railways displaced river transport and horse-drawn transport. Since World War II, they have to a large extent taken the transport task away from coastal sea transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Railway personnel&mdash;railway men, railway women&mdash;have a proud history of loyalty to their system and to their organisations. Many have worked for decades in poorly paid, lonely tasks, often unpleasant tasks, with little recognition of the nature of the work that they have to do. They have had little opportunity for training and little opportunity for career advancement, yet they have all been barrelled and lumped together in the definition of the railway system. Certainly there have been sections within the railway systems that have been better paid and better rewarded, but many railway men and women have been poorly paid, and their efforts and their isolation have not been adequately recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past it used to be that many young men in this country aspired to become engine drivers, loco drivers. The loco drivers were the aristocrats of the railway system and in yesteryear they were the equivalent of the Boeing 747 captains of today. They have had a proud involvement with their industry. They feel proud of their industry, and they deserve better treatment than they have received over recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of change it is essential, therefore, that railway men and women be consulted and be involved in the changes that are to take place. If we are to get the best from the railway system, we need to take advantage of the expertise of those people who work at grassroots level, who are actually involved in providing the services, and to ask them for ideas, as we do when we are talking about award restructuring, workplace rearrangements and operational practice changes. The people who do the jobs need to be consulted and involved. Most certainly, when we are talking about a rapid change in the number of positions and the nature of their tasks, the families of those railway men and women need to be involved and consulted. There needs to be a great deal of sensitivity and care for them in respect of the impact upon their lives and their careers when we move to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is due in the main to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement, and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail.</PARA>
<PARA>At this stage, I want to try to remove some of the mythology about the transport task in this country, that rail is good and road is bad, or road is good and rail is bad. It is not a case of one being good and the other bad; it is a case of each complementing the other. Out in the marketplace, in a large share of the transport task rail has a natural advantage and in a large share of it road has a natural advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that 80 per cent of goods transported move distances of less than 100 kilometres. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read a good deal about greater use being made of rail in moving goods from ports. Again the reality is that in Sydney and Melbourne 88 per cent of containers finish up in the metropolitan area, and clearly rail is not suited to that task; it is rubber-tyred transport that performs that short-haul task. So it is not a case of one being good and one being bad&mdash;let us get rid of that mythology&mdash;it is a case of each form of transport performing that task in which it has a natural advantage and for which it is best suited socially, economically and technically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go through a description again of what is involved in the Bill, because the Minister has covered that in his second reading speech, but I do want to mention the financial and industrial objectives of the new National Rail Corporation. It has been given a timetable of breaking even within three years and becoming totally self-supporting after five years. The Minister says the meeting of this target will, in itself, be a major achievement. It certainly will be a major achievement. It is a daunting objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what `break square' or `breaking even' means. I think we need to have that spelt out more clearly. Is it breaking even in respect of operating costs or some proportion of overhead costs, or is it approaching break square in terms of expenditure and revenue? I think that needs to be spelt out so that there are not unrealistic objectives built up and, as this process of change in the establishment of the NRC proceeds, so that we do not find ourselves a few years down the track having it pointed to as not having achieved its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The renegotiation of the industrial arrangements to have an enterprise agreement across the National Rail Corporation is, in itself, also a daunting task. It is an essential task, but a daunting one. There should not be any exaggerated expectations of what is to be achieved. People who will be affected should be involved, should be consulted, about the change that needs to be made. I am heartened and encouraged by the fact that at the top level of the ACTU there is very strong support for this objective. I just want to make the point that the objectives that have been set are very difficult to achieve. I want to see them achieved, but let us not underestimate the magnitude of the difficulties involved in achieving those tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the interstate rail freight deficits run at about $375m a year. That is more than $1m a day. Every day of the year the taxpayers of this country are handing over more than $1m to meet deficits on interstate rail freight. That effectively is a subsidy from taxpayers to commercial interests. It is what I call commercial welfare. That alone, the easing of the burden on taxpayers, is one reason why we have to press on with this objective. There will need to be ongoing vigilance to see that the timetable is adhered to, that the objectives are adhered to and that the organisational arrangements that are essential to this initiative are progressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked to see greater utilisation of the skills of AN. The Minister paid tribute to the achievements of the Australian National Railways Commission. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That rail can be a success in Australia has been clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth's own railway, the Australian National Railways Commission. AN has long practised the commercial approach and will be taken by the National Rail Corporation, and its success is clear for all to see. The Industry Commission acknowledged the achievements in its recent rail report.</PARA>
<PARA>He took the opportunity to congratulate AN, its employees and its management on what they have done since its establishment in 1978. Indeed, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect that the skills and expertise built up by AN will prove to be a valuable asset of the National Rail Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me add to that my congratulations, my commendation, in respect of the achievements of Australian National. It has been a long, hard slog. AN's employees have been involved in a great deal of trauma, as have the communities where services have been withdrawn in South Australia and where changes have been made. It is not easy, whether it be Mount Gambier, Victor Harbor, some of the country towns or wheat towns of South Australia or Port Augusta, Port Pirie or Peterborough. In all of those areas people have given their all to the improvement of Australian National. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that greater opportunity is not being taken to utilise those skills and that commitment. Australian National is the only railway system in this country that has a national ethos. It is the only railway system that has a truly commercial ethos. It is the only railway system that knows what national and interstate rail freight is about, because most of its revenue comes from that activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great difficulty with State railway systems has been that interstate rail freight revenue has been a minor proportion of their total revenue. It is not too late for Australian National to be closely involved and for the successes of Australian National and its expertise to be utilised to a greater extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to pay tribute to the people of Port Augusta. I mentioned Port Pirie and Peterborough. Those three towns in the Iron Triangle, but particularly Port Augusta, sitting astride the north-south, east-west axis of the interstate rail freight system of this country, have made a great effort and placed a great deal of trust in this Government to ensure that they remain a major rail centre. As an individual and as a member of this House, I pay tribute to them for their cooperation and support through the difficult times in the earlier years in helping to get AN to the point where it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I talk about consultation, I am talking about consultation right down to workshop level, to the fellows who work in the foundry, who work on the tools and who sweep the buildings. It is at that level that insecurity and worry for their families about change need to be addressed. It can be addressed; it is not an impossible task. I emphasise that because we owe it to those people in the railway system and in those State railway systems that will be affected by the establishment of the National Rail Corporation to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package announced considerable investment in the railway system. There was the standard gauge connection from Acacia Ridge in Brisbane; an investment of $82m which was long overdue for the upgrading of the Sydney-Brisbane line; and an investment of $110m, almost 20 years overdue, for the upgrading of the Sydney-Melbourne line. The experience and behaviour of governments, industry and State rail systems on the Sydney-Melbourne line is a clear example of what inertia and State interests can do to what is an essential national service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BTE report of 1975 pointed to a very positive cost-benefit result in the upgrading of the Sydney-Melbourne line. It pointed to a possible reduction in journey time of something considerably less than that being forecast now, something approaching seven to eight hours, virtually aiming for a halving of the journey time between Sydney and Melbourne. A halving of the journey time means a doubling of the capacity of that line. That sat on a shelf during the period of the Fraser Government because everybody became distracted with the proposed electrification of the Sydney to Melbourne line. It was a nonsense to begin with and it remained a nonsense, but it took us seven years to get that out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in 1984, as we started trying to get the States thinking nationally about rail freight systems&mdash;we established the national rail freight group, I think in 1985, to try to get orientation towards the national economic interest&mdash;along came the VFT proposal. The VFT was always an indulgence and I would not put a rotten dollar of my money in it, but it served to distract the Government's attention away from what needed to be done, that is, the upgrading of the Sydney-Melbourne line, the most important link in the rail service of this country. So 14 years were lost by distractions with grand schemes rather than getting on with the basic issue that needed to be addressed and carried out, the upgrading of the Sydney-Melbourne line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look also at port investment and at interstate rail investment. Where are the railways going? Where are port movements going? I will look quickly at the figures that are available. We hear a lot said about trucks between Sydney and Melbourne. There will always be trucks between Sydney and Melbourne because there are services&mdash;high value, low volume cargoes&mdash;that are better carried out by trucks. The market will determine that. If we have road, rail and sea, each performing at peak efficiency and each performing the task to which they are best suited, it is then up to the market, through a soundly based pricing or rating system, to determine who gets what share. Each of the three has a natural advantage, particularly road and rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the movement of containers in 1990-91 between the various major capitals, we find that in that period overall some 4.4 million tonnes of goods were moved by containers and that 1.1 million tonnes of containers of shipping origin were moved. Already integrated services are provided, and part of the objective of this exercise is to have an integrated road, rail and sea service. Already there is substantial movement of containers as part of a total shipping journey by rail between our capitals, between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the movement south from New South Wales to Victoria, 74,000 tonnes were moved in containers by rail in 1990-91. On the northbound journey, V/Line to New South Wales, 122,000 tonnes were moved. From Queensland down to New South Wales there was a vast difference. The tonnage of containers for domestic use, land side use, was 256,000 tonnes. But the movement of containers south from Queensland to New South Wales was 236,000 tonnes&mdash;almost a match in the quantity of cargo moving by land as part of an overall sea journey. Similarly, if we look at the other figures&mdash;and I do not have time to go through all of them&mdash;I simply make the point that most container movement by rail is in respect of only a land journey. About the equivalent of a quarter of those figures are journeys of containers as part of an overall shipping movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the ports and I have mentioned the investment in the ports. We hear a lot of talk about land bridging, whether it is east-west land bridging or north-south land bridging from Alice Springs to Darwin, from Darwin to Alice Springs, or to points in the south such as Adelaide or Melbourne. Again, I think that is something that is way in the future. When we talk about land bridging, we are talking about a ship dropping goods off at a port and then the goods continuing east-west by rail. The theory is that all ships eastbound will unload at Fremantle and cargo will go by rail for the rest of the journey, and that all ships westbound will unload in Sydney or Melbourne and cargo will go westward by rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For land bridging to work, it must offer a substantial commercial advantage over existing services. The fact is that it does not. This can be compared with the alternatives in the US, where land bridging ships drop off goods on the west coast of the US which then travel by rail across the US to a major market in the mid-west. There are markets generating in the mid-west going to the east coast of the US. The alternatives are to go down around the Panama Canal, which is a much longer journey, or even via Cape Horn, which is a much, much longer journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not apply in the case of east-west movement of containers in Australia. In fact, the journey distances are about the same. Unless there is a commercial advantage, it will not happen. I do not think it will happen. It ought not happen unless it is soundly based commercially; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>it has to be the right commercial thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story is different for north-south land bridging from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and possibly Adelaide. The upgrading of the port services into Melbourne and Dynon and the road link to the Dynon goods yard will facilitate movement of containers in and out of Melbourne and connection to the rail system. Similarly, southbound Acacia Ridge-Fisherman Islands standard gauge link will mean that there will be the potential for ships to unload at Brisbane and for the containers to then continue the rest of their journey southbound, regardless of where they are going&mdash;Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide&mdash;by rail. That is already happening and it will happen more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have a global shipping service that concentrates on the big 4,000-container vessels going around the world east or west and as Australia's shipping services feed up and down from the major ports, particularly Singapore, that means that the ships which will be visiting Australian ports will be ships of smaller size and poorer configuration which are less efficient. That is the nature of the world market. But it means that, with an upgraded Sydney-Brisbane line and an upgraded Sydney-Melbourne line, the Brisbane rail system will have the potential to play a much more effective role for the right commercial reasons. It will offer better rates, better service or both. That is how it ought to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation has the potential to see that improvement. The National Rail Corporation, if it is properly managed, properly oriented and moves with speed in its establishment and development, will be able to make a substantial addition and improvement to the efficiency not only of our interstate movement of containers, but also of our international movement of containers and bring a considerable economic benefit to this country. For those reasons, I have tried to bring the National Rail Corporation into the national context. It has a very difficult task ahead of it. I wish it well and I commend the Bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is at the table. He was recently in Ballarat, and he knows what a very vibrant city it is and what great potential it has, with a bit of input from everyone across the board: both community and government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), discussed the generalities of this matter in the House yesterday. I do not intend to do that and I make no apologies for being extremely parochial in my comments today. The NRC and the question of Ballarat's future are obviously of enormous relevance and significance to the Ballarat electorate and especially to those in Ballarat. It is of great significance to those many men and women who have served with the railways in my region for many years and to those who wish to retain their jobs, as well as to those who wish to get some of the advantages which may flow from this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another group whom this concerns, and that is the many men and women who travel from Ballarat to Melbourne and return every day. They are people who have seen the light and who wanted to get out of Melbourne. I hope that my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, will excuse me for saying so, but I really cannot blame them for trying to get out of Melbourne and move to the magnificent centre of Ballarat and its districts. I say that somewhat tongue in cheek, but the problems they potentially face under one of the options, or a number of the options, are of great significance to them. That also includes the option of Ballarat-Melbourne via Geelong. There are a number of options in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of the Ballarat National Rail Support Committee, which has been very active in this matter. I will read from the submission put to Mr Ted Butcher, the Chairman, in a document dated 12 February. This submission relates to three matters. Part 1 is `Ballarat Railway Workshops: A Profile', part 2 is `Ballarat Freight/Container Terminal Strategy', and part 3 is `Passenger Rail Services Between Ballarat &amp; Melbourne'. It is impossible for me to provide all honourable members with a copy of this report; therefore, I will quote selected parts from it. Part 1 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ballarat Railway Workshops continues Ballarat's proud tradition of involvement in the manufacture of locomotives and other rolling stock&mdash;a tradition which began in the 1870's when the first steam locomotive was built at the Phoenix Foundry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Phoenix Foundry, which started making machinery for mining companies in 1856, was responsible for the manufacture of 352 steam engines for Victorian Railways. At its peak, the foundry employed 700 men and produced more than 20 different classes of locomotive. However, the subsequent development of the Newport Workshops resulted in the closure of the Phoenix Foundry in 1906.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within 10 years, Newport was struggling to satisfy the demand for engines. This led to calls for the establishment of further workshops elsewhere in Victoria to take the pressure off Newport. In response, the Ballarat City Council offered to make a financial contribution if the Government would consider establishing an engine building factory at Ballarat. Although the Government declined the offer of financial assistance, it did agree to build workshops at Ballarat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Completed in 1917, the Ballarat Workshops opened with 100 men repairing trucks and locomotives. The first steam locomotive was built in 1919 and by 1922, 13 locomotives had been manufactured.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite obviously, our bona fides in relation to rail right throughout Australia are very genuine. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From its inception the Ballarat Workshops has been a major manufacturing centre for Victorian Railways and, more recently, the Public Transport Corporation. In line with developments in rail transport, the main function of the workshops has changed and diversified over its history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the earlier concentration on the manufacture of steam locomotives, it became a major repairer of carriages and wagons in the 1940's. By the 1950's, the Railway Workshops was producing the large bogie type wagons, such as cable carriers and louvre vans. This continued into the early 1980's, when the conversion of purpose built wagons to three-pak container wagons, as well as various other wagon modifications, were added to the types of work undertaken at the Workshops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a review in the early 1980's, strategies were developed to modernise all rail workshops and make them more competitive in the open market. It was decided that the Ballarat Workshops would become the Public Transport Corporation's manufacturing and commercial centre. The emphasis would be on quality.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, quality is something that Ballarat has a very proud history of. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, all the old buildings to be retained were refurbished, and those no longer required were demolished. Some new buildings were erected and an upgrading of plant and equipment was also carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ballarat Workshops is one of the few workshops which meets the Australian Standard (AS3903) on Quality. It is also one of even fewer workshops which has gained Defence Department supply approval. Consequently, tenders for work have been successful with the State Electricity Commission, VicRoads, Clyde Engineering, Comeng, the Australian Army and South Australian Railways.</PARA>
<PARA>A large amount of work is currently being undertaken. It was my privilege and pleasure to be given a tour of the Ballarat North workshops three months ago. On a personal note, although I was unable to come to terms with being called `comrade', I did enjoy my time in the workshops. It is now a very high quality operation. The railway unions in Ballarat, the Ballarat City Council, the Ballarat Regional Board, others and I are anxious to ensure not only that that work continue but also that we get a slice of the action&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;out of the proposals coming through this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister is also aware of our very great desire to participate in that. I am not saying that we should participate simply because it is Ballarat. We are not resting on our laurels; there is no doubt that it is justified on the quality of work we are producing there. I am very proud of the work that is coming from Ballarat. It is imperative that we not only retain that work, but that we also be given the opportunity to tender after the process is finished in due course. I have no doubt that we will tender successfully for that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the Ballarat work force is now down to 280 employees, which is a significant reduction from its peak of some 700 employees during the 1960s. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Workshops continue to be a valuable training ground for the Ballarat workforce. Over the last decade, more than 100 apprentices have been employed across a range of skilled trades; including boilermakers, blacksmiths, electricians, carpenters, fitter and turners, painters and upholsterers. Many successful Ballarat businesses are now run by people who gained their basic training as local Workshop apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA>If I may diverge slightly to another matter, what we have seen in Ballarat over the last 10 or 15 years, regrettably, is a withdrawal of those exceptionally skilled trades men and women that Ballarat was renowned for. I have been told on numerous occasions that if someone from Ballarat applied for a job&mdash;I am sure the Minister would be interested in this&mdash;outside Ballarat, whether he was trained at the workshops or at one of the other large manufacturers, this was really a ready entree to a job anywhere within Australia. The skill levels were so high that one really did not need to sit down and do any sort of test. If a person had been trained in Ballarat, then he had been trained properly and, therefore, would move straight into a position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quite horrific decline that I have seen in my region over the last 15 years has had a dramatic impact. The skill levels of those who have been trained in Ballarat have not in any way reduced but it causes me a great deal of distress to see that the numbers of people being trained are reducing quite significantly. As you may be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am fourth or fifth generation and my two-year old son and family are either fifth or sixth generation&mdash;I have not checked up. I am very close to the region and it breaks my heart to see what is happening. But, in saying that, I still believe that the situation can be addressed with a positive attitude. The sorts of things I am talking about are enormous skill levels, with a very vibrant manufacturing sector. I think that, if we use our brains, make the right decisions and have a commitment right across the board, we can return to that former situation. I now turn to the freight strategy. On this proposal, we state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With adequate facilities, it would be possible to attract all current containers to a road/rail terminal. This would require a terminal located in the outlying area with a gantry facility, as well as three phase power. With three phase power alone, V/Line could attract 3,000 or more containers from McCain Foods. Currently these containers are road freighted ex Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore proposed that the current rail/road container terminal and the fast track small freight terminal at the Ballarat Freightgate in the centre of the city be transferred to the "Redan" line, which is a spur off the main Melbourne-Adelaide line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land required is available and the terminal would complement the siding currently under negotiation with the Mars company for its Australian distribution warehouse.</PARA>
<PARA>The plans are fairly well down the track&mdash;that is perhaps a poor choice of words, given our present debate. The plans are under way and there is a commitment from local municipalities to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen a full copy of the Booz-Allen and Hamilton report to the PTC. The Minister might have a copy that I could obtain from his office in due course. I gather the options canvassed in that report are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.standard gauge Yaapeet, Hopetoun, Portland lines</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">dual gauge west main line Ararat-Dimboola</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">alternative service west grain lines</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.mainline via Geelong, dual gauge west main line Ararat-Dimboola</PARA>
<PARA>My friend and colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and I initially discussed this question on an extremely bumpy ride on the plane coming up on Monday night. We could not eat, we could not have a glass of soda water, so we were actively involved in discussions about this matter. We had further discussions in the corridor yesterday. I know that the honourable member for Corio is as concerned as I am about the final decisions that are made in relation to this matter. I do not mean only the freight question, but also the passenger side and the freight link-ups. They have very long term ramifications for Geelong and Ballarat. If we do not get it right now, I have no doubt that another opportunity will never be presented to us, because the infrastructure costs will be so prohibitive that they would not, in my view, be changed in your lifetime, Mr Deputy Speaker, or my lifetime or the Minister's lifetime. So the decisions we make at this stage in relation to this matter are extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was an active and keen supporter of the decision that was ultimately made by Mr Butcher as to where the route should be. I am not saying that I have necessarily cooled on that option, or that decision, in effect, but I have great concern that if we are potentially going to cut the State in half&mdash;and again this is a matter that the honourable member for Corio and I have discussed&mdash;the long term ramifications of cutting the State in half with grain lines, et cetera, are matters that I do not think can be simply glossed over with the statement, `Well, we will look at that and address it in due course'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PTC report specifically addresses those proposals, but there are still a number of options. I want to ensure that those options maximise and retain as much as possible of that transport infrastructure that country Victoria has relied on for a lot longer than I have been on this earth. I presume that that reliance will be there. I will be an active pursuer of that reliance gaining pace, as opposed to reducing, because, if that infrastructure were to break down, the ramifications for our road network would be fairly disastrous. I do not believe that any government of any political persuasion is going to have the funds to repair or replace that road network. We have to be very careful that the ramifications of the decisions that are made now are looked at extremely carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not at this stage had the opportunity to read in detail the comments made on Monday by the Premier of Victoria in relation to the regional development plans, but for many years Ballarat has been targeted as a growth centre. It is a growth centre that I certainly want to see eventuate. Leaving aside the potential costs of infrastructure that will obviously be associated with an enormously expanded population, there is also the question of relocation to Ballarat. But of equal importance is the opportunity for Ballarat people to live in Ballarat and work in Melbourne. I presume the honourable member for Corio will let me know if I am wrong, but I presume that thousands have accepted the option to travel from Geelong and some of those coastal areas to work in Melbourne. As I said before, obviously the quality of life question would determine that sort of movement away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Ballarat-Melbourne passenger service is put at any risk or, given the pressures of modern day living, if it becomes a non-viable option time-wise, my great concern is that the potential for growth in the Ballarat region is going to be significantly diminished. I know the Minister is well aware of my views on this matter as I have discussed those views with him, as have a large number of others, and he is aware of my concerns and the concerns of others that we retain for Ballarat, as a minimum, an efficient and reliable passenger service, because without that Ballarat will not develop to its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is enormous opportunity for the community of Ballarat to attract a significant population increase by making all those options available to those who are presently crowding themselves into metropolitan Melbourne. Having been down there last Friday and having seen that haze hanging over an otherwise very pretty city, I can understand that they would be pretty anxious to get out of the place, but they will only be anxious to get out if all those things are in place and if it is a viable option, economically, time-wise, quality of life-wise, to move from those areas to Ballarat. In my view, it will only be viable if we can retain a rail network that is delivering those efficiencies, and is delivering them effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have addressed most of the matters I wish to canvass today. I compliment my shadow colleague for the matters that he raised yesterday. I am sure that they have not been lost on the Minister. There is no doubt that if we are going to retain and expand what is a desperately needed rail system throughout this country we have to start doing things a hell of a lot smarter than we have done in the past. It has to be an efficient service that can justify itself economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Butcher has said, he will only make decisions on the basis that they are commercial decisions and they are economically viable. I applaud him for approaching the matter in that manner, and I am sure the Minister is equally keen to see that happen, as is the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon. We cannot carry into the next decade or the next century the inefficiencies that have ravaged the rail systems throughout Australia, both at an Australian and a State level. I accept and support the Bill, but I wish that those very real concerns that I have from my region are taken into consideration when the decisions are made at the end of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill, I express some pleasure at the opportunity to speak on a national initiative in respect to rail services. Last night I heard the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) talking about the fact that it took 10 years for this Government to get around to doing something about the national rail services and the need for corporatisation. The father of the honourable member for Bruce was a member of this Parliament some 40 or 50 years ago. At that stage only one initiative had been taken on rail services since Federation, and that was the building of Transrail by the Fisher Government in about 1910 or 1911. It opened in about 1917. When dealing with our rail problems we need to go beyond that back to the colonies. I suppose our present legacy is a legacy of the interference of the British Colonial Office in decisions which should have been made on the basis of the needs of Australia rather than by someone in Whitehall or wherever he happened to be located.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history is well known. New South Wales decided to build rail services at a certain level; Victoria actually started to build rail services; New South Wales did not build any but changed its mind. The Colonial Office agreed, ordered the Victorians to change again, and did it a third time without New South Wales putting down one sleeper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the third occasion the Victorians said, `I think that's enough. We are spending our money. You're just making decisions on the basis of what you might do'. So we ended up with a piebald rail system; it was inefficient and inappropriate. But this did not really show up as such until 40 or 50 years ago. The transhipping and such were not as important as they are now. We had ports everywhere; we had coastal shipping. The movement of freight on an interstate basis was not necessarily by rail. For the benefit of the honourable member for Bruce, I might say that this Government is the first Labor Government in peacetime since Federation to have been in office for a period longer than four years. If one has to negotiate anything complex with the States, four years is not going to work. But there were some opportunities for the conservative governments had they wished to take them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant move in this direction took place during the period of the Whitlam Government. It sought to take over the State rail services which were then ridden with debt, as they are now; they were inefficient; and in the case of Victoria, and I think all other States for that matter, one has to say that they were not having appropriate money spent on them to modernise and maintain them or to enable them to compete in what was fast developing; that is in the areas of competence and expertise of rail services which were not as pick-up carriers, but rather as bulk long term haulers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also grossly unfair, if not improper, to try to make comparisons, as some do, between rail services in Europe or the United States and Australia, and more particularly between Japan and Australia. I heard someone make a statement on how, in certain circumstances, the European rail services are able to operate with much higher efficiencies and lower losses than Australia can. The Japanese system is always held up as an example. I think that in 150 miles in Japan there are seven cities with over two million people. It can run a passenger service. In fact, air transport is uneconomic. The only two cities in Australia in similar circumstances are 600 miles or 1,000 kilometres apart. There are virtually no large cities in between to provide pick-up and put-down services. There is no comparison between the economics of those sorts of operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the charter of the national rail service is too narrow. I think the original Booz-Allen report relating to the Melbourne-Adelaide standardisation&mdash;and it is arguable whether it is necessary at all, but nevertheless the decision has been made that it shall be built&mdash;was sloppy and incompetent. It took account only of the narrowest view; that is, what would be the outcome if the National Rail Corporation were able to do what it wished and ignored the consequences of what it did? `Ignored the consequences' is the crucial point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has already mentioned the severing of Victoria by the standardisation of the Melbourne-Adelaide line. A lot of the network of rail services in Victoria was built to sell land in Melbourne for land speculators in the 1880s. This is a problem which the Victorian taxpayer has lived with for 100 years. There have been some people in this Parliament, of very recent vintage, whose fortunes were founded on that land speculation and the building of railways. There are three railways lines up into the Mallee, where one would have well done, even in the 1880s. But the land prices were good once the railway line was put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, Victoria is divided by the Melbourne-Adelaide line. It goes north-west through Victoria to Serviceton. All of the services which cart wheat, for instance&mdash;which is the major freight element of rail services in that area&mdash;cross or travel on the proposed standard gauge line for some period. They are all five foot three lines and none of them could be economically changed to a standard gauge line with any prospect whatsoever of commercial viability. The original Booz-Allen report leaves the Victorian Government to bear the total cost of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ballarat has mentioned the Melbourne-Ballarat proposal. In the original Booz-Allen report, the Melbourne-Ballarat proposal would have discontinued all passenger services, commuter services and others between Melbourne and Ballarat. It ignores the extensive and long gradients, and the time taken between points where changeovers can take place. It is a computer model without any actual input into the total traffic. Its viability is based on the elimination of all non-interstate traffic. At the moment, the interstate traffic travelling between Melbourne and Adelaide uses two routes&mdash;not one. The up trains are the ones going down to Melbourne. The up trains would normally go through Ballarat and down through Bacchus Marsh. It is downhill; it is quick; it is easy; and it is shorter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trains which are carrying freight to Adelaide normally travel in the small hours of the morning. They go through Geelong, Maroona and on their way to South Australia. They can carry at least one-third more freight because of the lack of grades, and it is much faster. This is not taken account of in the Booz-Allen report. As the honourable member for Ballarat mentioned, it has not taken account of the fact that there is now a large commuter service provided by the Victorian railways, VicRail, in the areas out of Melbourne where people have chosen to go and live because of the lifestyle effects. From everyone's point of view, it is better that they commute by rail rather than having more buses on the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in fact, the consequences of the Booz-Allen report were to put that traffic which they are eliminating from rail on the road, we would have to restructure almost every major road in northern Victoria, north-western Victoria and the Mallee. There would be no way that wheat traffic could get to Portland or Geelong for shipment overseas. It is a straight barrier. I do not think that is competence. I think that should be drawn attention to. I do not think one can say, `If we take over these lines and to hell with the consequences, it will pay'. That is not a proper consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that Geelong or Ballarat&mdash;and I differ with the honourable member for Ballarat on this&mdash;is going to gain one iota or one cent of commercial activity as a result of these lines passing through. What will happen in Ballarat when the interstate freight goes through&mdash;if there is a guard on it, and there may not be&mdash;is that they may wave to someone on the side of the line, but they certainly will not stop. Similarly, the trains already go through Geelong in the middle of the night, and 99 per cent of people in Geelong do not even know it. There is certainly no commercial benefit. They will not have any effect on the Ballarat workshops, although there are other factors which have been built in largely by the Victorian Government which will give some work to those workshops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that Ballarat, Bendigo and Newport have been important training grounds, as was Telecom until a former Liberal Government decided that in future it should not subsidise the training of apprentices. But those three institutions have trained half of the Victorian apprentices and the best tradesmen in that State over a number of years. It has been a cost to the Victorian railways and the taxpayers of Victoria which has been borne because it had certain benefits to the State, and those benefits will not flow with commercialisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the National Rail Corporation. There are currently three propositions; none of them can be divorced from the need to deal with the problem of moving wheat in Victoria and other freight which comes from Mildura, Maryborough, Hopetoun, Warracknabeal, Echuca and those areas. They all cross the standard gauge line; they all use lines which could not be incorporated in the National Rail Corporation's proposals. It seems to me that one cannot have those lines converted to the standard gauge. Whilst it is nice, it is enormously expensive and there is no justification at this time in our history to spend that sort of money. Certainly, they could not be commercially viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two routes that I understand are now possible. The Victorian Government has given an undertaking that it will finance the conversion to Portland and the conversion from Ballarat-Geelong. I say that on its own Ballarat-Geelong is useless. It would be an absolute waste of money and an incompetent decision. Built into a Geelong-Ballarat-Melbourne loop it probably is a reasonable proposition, although it is further, with no real benefit to the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If those lines are converted, they must add to the cost of carting wheat, and there is no return for it. I think there is little necessity for that. If a separate broad gauge line was provided between Horsham and Ararat, which is a distance of about 90 miles, and if there was a separate broad gauge line between Ballarat and Geelong, we could cater for all the broad gauge lines in western Victoria. There is provision on the Ballarat-Geelong route for a double line. There was a double line between Ballarat and Geelong until 1931, but it was pulled up to save money. Wheat going to Portland and Geelong would be able to feed onto the broad gauge line somewhere between Horsham and Ararat and it could go down the Maroona or the Portland lines to the ports of shipment. That option seems to me to be quite viable. It is not an extensive length of railway line involved. It also opens up the possibility of the movement of the sands to the north of Horsham which have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other proposition is that of Geelong-Ballarat. If a broad gauge line is maintained there, the Maryborough and Swan Hill lines are automatically connected to the port of Geelong, and they have a course of action which will allow them to operate without extensive cost. Because Geelong is a major port and a major bulk port, it should be connected into a standard gauge network. The proposition that the standard gauge line should go from Melbourne through Geelong to Ballarat is the most politically accepted, even though it may not be the most commercially viable. Certainly Melbourne-Ballarat as a direct route would be an incompetent decision, and the cost of it would be enormous. It would cut off the northern and north-western parts of Victoria from Melbourne because none of them have standard gauge facilities which would enable them to join the Melbourne line and utilise that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those areas may have alternatives through Bendigo. But once we put in a standard gauge link which goes through Ballarat and chops out the Ballarat link as well, there is virtually nowhere to go. The trains would have to come down through Geelong and back up to Melbourne, or something like that. I believe the most practical option&mdash;not necessarily the most commercially viable&mdash;is for the Victorian Government and the National Rail Corporation to come to some arrangement with respect to the Geelong-Ballarat link with Melbourne for national freight. It is slightly less in grade, and therefore there would be greater speed, and there is the prospect of greater loads because the Bacchus Marsh bank is one of the worst in Australia. It certainly should not be tolerated on a main line, but we are not about to alter it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if we are going to use that line for the purposes we are now talking about, many of the viaducts would have to be renewed at enormous cost. Anyone who has travelled on trains on the loop out of Bacchus Marsh, as I have, will know that it is awfully slow going, especially on diesels. It takes 50 minutes to get from Bacchus Marsh to Ballan, and that is only about 10 miles. Having said that, I think I should say that there is a real need to pursue a policy whereby rail freight is seen as national freight&mdash;and I do not only mean interstate freight&mdash;where the alternative of rail is adequately available for bulk freight carriage in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot of pie in the sky things about railways overseas. We have heard about how we can hire trains and such. I would like to put something to the Minister that I have been suggesting for a long time. In my maiden speech in this place just over 24 years ago I mentioned the need for a standard gauge link between Geelong and Melbourne. At that stage daily trains were running through to the Ford Motor Co. In my earlier career I had worked at Wodonga, where we pushed trucks in and out of sidings at Albury all day so that they could be transhipped by inland wharfies. It was one of the most wasteful exercises one could imagine. The situation has improved since then, but the transhipping still has to take  place  wherever  the  standard  gauge stops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at these aspects we should also look at other things that the railways can do. In the early 1950s a commissioner of the Commonwealth Railways decided that carrying passengers on the transcontinental line with two or three carriages was a waste of engine power. He took the decision to load fast freight vehicles on the front and to piggyback road vehicles on trains using that route. It was commercially successful. I do not know how long it stayed commercially successful. People could drive onto the transcontinental with a semitrailer at Port Augusta and drive it off at Kalgoorlie. Subsequently the standard gauge went from Kalgoorlie to Perth and that may have made a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously worth considering interstate flat-car trains running express between Melbourne and Sydney carrying semitrailers at a reasonable freight rate. A train could start at Campbellfield or Liverpool, or wherever is more appropriate in Sydney, where trucks could drive on and be bolted down. The drivers could sleep in their cabins or in a carriage at the back, but I think they would want to stay in their cabins. When the train is full with, say, 20 or 30 semitrailers, it could pull out and go to Sydney on a straight through basis. Such a system would take 20 or 30 trucks off the road, and it would save wear and tear for owner-drivers. I do not think it would be much dearer than the cost of petrol and wear and tear on the roads and the transports themselves.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something which I think is viable, and it ought to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is happening and will continue to happen is that the quantity of freight being moved will increase. The use of sea has almost disappeared. The roads cannot be upgraded on a continual basis at a rate which will enable that freight to be safely carried. We only have to look at the bus smashes and the blockages that occur on our highways. The Hume Highway was blocked for seven  hours the other day. According to the Victorian Government, it is proposed to put 100 truck loads of chemicals on the Geelong-Melbourne road every day. It is a road on which it will be extremely dangerous to carry volatile chemicals. If we can utilise the rail system in an efficient and commercially viable way&mdash;and I believe piggybacking trucks is one way&mdash;we will do a service to motorists and to the Australian community. I think it is well worth looking at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill. It is significant that the preceding two speakers, namely, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), and I represent the three largest provincial cities in Victoria. They are cities that have had long  established links with rail for the greater part of its history. The port of Geelong, which is represented by the honourable member for Corio, has played a very significant part in the export of wool and grain and other commodities from the rural sector. I know of the honourable member for Corio's long interest in rail, and I recognise his superior knowledge about a lot of rail activities. I understand that he was employed by the rail organisation in Victoria. I am not sure of its name then; it has had so many name changes in its history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the contribution by my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat. I refer to the role that Bendigo and Ballarat played in the establishment of a rail network. We had the establishment of rail workshops at both Ballarat and Bendigo. Bendigo played a significant part in the dispersal of railway traffic out of the Riverina area, where wool and grain were trafficked down originally by river to the railhead at Echuca and then down through Bendigo and subsequently to Geelong for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what the Government is doing with the establishment of the interstate rail freight service on a commercial basis is very important, and I stress the words `commercial basis'. The Bill before the House sets out the purpose of the establishment of the service, and the agreement is set out in schedule 1 of the Bill. The parties to that agreement agreed that the company would be established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations in Australia on a commercial basis. One of the most important tests for the Government is going to be ensuring that it meets the commercial criteria that other commercial organisations adhere to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of the Bill set out that the company will operate on that strictly commercial basis. It will also have access to the requisite assets that are involved. It will operate under labour agreements that reflect the best international practice in productivity standards, and it will be able to contract activities where appropriate and provide access to its network and facilities to public and private sector operators. It will also be able to provide services to governments on a strictly commercial basis and will not be in any way responsible for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles are set out very clearly in the Bill, and the Bill provides that the National Rail Corporation will be subject to rates, taxes and charges. I am pleased that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is at the table at the moment because I am not sure whether in fact it is indicated that the National Rail Corporation will be subject to local government rates for any enterprise that may be established on land within a local government area. The Minister might respond to that at some time during the debate. Certainly, the objective to perform on a commercial basis should be adhered to, and in fact the Corporation should meet the requirements that would be faced by road operators in similar circumstances where they may have a road users depot established on local government land. Of course, they would pay full local government rates, taxes and charges applicable to the establishment of that depot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact is very important, and quite a few comments were made about that impact particularly as it relates to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The Corporation is expected to have an impact on the deficits of State railway systems and Australian National. The total losses on interstate rail freight were estimated to have amounted to $377m in 1989-90. The National Rail Corporation is supposed to break even within three years and to be fully self-sufficient within five years, which is a notable objective. One can just hope that the Government is able to perform to that timetable and is able to get the National Rail Corporation to operate within that type of financial framework. That will depend greatly, of course, upon the industrial relations negotiations that will be undertaken prior to the establishment of the body itself. I understand that those negotiations are taking place. But the whole key to the establishment of this Corporation largely hinges on the introduction of best practice in productivity standards and satisfactory enterprise agreement awards so that the industrial relations part of it is set out very clearly before we embark upon this project. It would be senseless entering into any agreement which may lead to the sorts of practices that we have seen in the Victorian railway system over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are inefficiencies in the system, and people within the rail system in Victoria are the first to acknowledge some of those inefficiencies. The inefficiencies seem to have become entrenched and have been extremely difficult for any government in the State of Victoria to overcome. We certainly would not want to enter into a situation where they could be prolonged or included in the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. I note that the Minister is listening and agrees that those problems need to be solved for this venture to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the coalition's point of view, this is one of the most important factors in the establishment of the Rail Corporation. It will enable the Corporation to compete and to carry the sorts of freight and commodities that are best able to be carried on rail. Some of those, of course, include bulk commodities such as grain, coal, iron ore and fuel. The practice of using the roll-on roll-off vehicles that we have seen in other countries throughout the world needs to be encouraged here in Australia so that we have the ability to cater for that type of traffic on the freight side of the National Rail Corporation's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corio mentioned the carriage of fuel and chemicals. I believe that rail is very well equipped to handle this type of commodity. Given that the proper procedures are followed, these commodities can be carried very safely. There is always a risk transporting fuel and toxic chemicals from State to State, and it is important that the safety aspects of that carriage be ensured. What better way to do that than to have it carried in bulk and carried on rail where it is free from a lot of the other traffic that perhaps could subject it to risk when carried on road?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But once again, of course, the industrial relations side of it needs to be right, and the commercial practices need to be right so that we have true and open competition between road and rail. There needs to be equality with regard to taxes and land charges so that one group, for example the Rail Corporation, does not have an advantage over the rest of the transport industry in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One item in the Bill, on page 13, causes me a little concern. It reference to the directors who will be appointed to the National Rail Corporation, section 4(4)(a) of the schedule states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . three Directors nominated by the Commonwealth, one being the Chairperson of the Board of Directors and one, as a matter of Commonwealth policy, being a nominee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, not being a member of a union directly associated with operations of the Company . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think that might be the true parliamentary language, but although it says that it is Commonwealth policy the nomination of an Australian Council of Trade Unions representative is in fact Australian Labor Party policy. It just happens to be that that Party is in government, so it has become Government policy. I am not quite sure that it is a matter of Commonwealth policy, and I think that the term is really a bit of a misnomer. I pursue that issue because I believe it is important that the employees who become involved in the National Rail Corporation have the opportunity to take up equity in the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see any provision for it in the way the shareholding is constructed. It may well be that the employees can buy shares on the public market. The Minister may be able to correct me if I have a misunderstanding about whether there  is any provision for employees of the Corporation to have a share in the equity of that organisation. I am of the firm belief that if employees have a stake in the operation, are treated as though they are part of that organisation and have a profit motivation, they will want to do the correct job and be involved with the National Rail Corporation. If the staff want to be involved in the shareholding and the equity of the company, they should have the opportunity to do so. It is similar to what was done with the Commonwealth Bank float where employees were given the opportunity to take up shares. I understand that many of the employees of the Commonwealth Bank decided to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns about what will happen to the intrastate lines. In Victoria particularly the National Rail Corporation will take over some of the major lines, but what will happen to some of the other lines within Victoria? I am particularly concerned about that. I want to receive assurances from the Minister and from the Government that many of those very good lines which service areas such as Bendigo and Ballarat are not interfered with and left out as the poor relation because I understand that V/Line would still have an involvement in the operation of those lines; I am not sure exactly how V/Line will manage them and how it will operate under the charter of the National Rail Corporation. If those lines are operating profitably and carrying freight, it is important that they be kept up to a very high standard. I encourage the National Rail Corporation to take some of those lines over, maintain the standards that are being set for the interstate transmission, and apply those standards intrastate so that they are kept at a high level and provide the sorts of services that the clients and customers would want to see in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined a number of concerns in my contribution, but I want to express another concern: I visited the Bendigo railway workshops at the invitation of Mr Ivan Kitt. I had discussions with the union representatives there. These workshops have gone through an upgrading of their equipment and have very good skills in many areas which are particularly related to the establishment and conduct of the National Rail Corporation and its activities. They are desirous of competing for much of the maintenance work and the new construction work. They particularly have the ability to compete in general engineering, an area in which they have many skills. They also have skills in the construction of rolling stock and its maintenance. They have done some very good projects over the years, which I have had the opportunity to observe. I have also observed the quality of the work these workshops are able to produce. Naturally, that level of expertise would not want to be lost with the establishment of the National Rail Corporation; it would need to be retained. The workshops are keen to compete, and have the ability to compete, for that work. I noted the comments made by the honourable member for Corio indicating that the Victorian State Government had made provision for this. I would be interested to hear what that provision was. Obviously they would have to compete on a commercial basis; they would have to be viable and efficient. I believe that they are and that they have the expertise which has been built up over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that causes me great concern is the fact that much of the existing rolling stock that was already owned in Victoria was sold off by the Victorian Government and then re-leased back by it. I fail to see the economies involved in that. The taxpayers already owned rolling stock&mdash;much of it had been in the ownership of the taxpayer for many years&mdash;and it was sold, purely and simply to prop up an ailing Labor Government in Victoria, and then re-leased&mdash;again at the taxpayers expense. I find that management technique to be especially abhorrent because all it does is place a greater financial burden on the Victorian and Australian taxpayers. One would hope that that exercise is not repeated by the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is at the table and is very interested in this topic. He would be well aware of the Bendigo railway workshops, as he is with the Ballarat railway workshops, and the important role they may be able to play in the future not only in constructing and doing general engineering but also producing rolling stock and providing maintenance for the National Rail Corporation. I commend that to him. I would be interested to see how the provisions that were mentioned by the honourable member for Corio regarding the Victorian State Government's involvement in the matter will ensure that those areas do receive some work. We would want to see it done on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that the employees at Bendigo would respond very well to the challenge. I am sure that the quality of their work would be unsurpassed. As I say, I have expressed a number of the concerns I have. I trust that the Minister will be able to answer them at the appropriate time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), when presenting the second reading speech for the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill represents another major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy.</PARA>
<PARA>One wonders why it has taken nine years for this Government to come to this reform. It was definitely on the back-burner when the Minister and his colleagues were playing footsies with the entrepreneurs in the mid-1980s in this community. It is only now when we are facing the question of economic survival in this country that the Government addresses one of the most important questions in the Australian economy. Important it is. In his speech he quotes the Industry Commission, which estimated that in 1989-90, if proper attention were given to the transport systems in Australia, it could realise an additional $6 billion in gross domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributed to the refurbishment of the rail system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the history of the development of rail in Australia, we see in the latter years&mdash;and certainly since Federation&mdash;one of the darker sides of Australian systems of government: an inability of States to provide a national interest in the formulation of their own regional proposals. As I have said, it has taken a very long time, at this late hour in the economic challenge to Australia, to get States to agree with the Commonwealth to do something about this enormous dereliction of duty in the management of Australian rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone back to a few historical points to help my appreciation of what has occurred. I will read just a few points of past history; there are a few across this great panorama of development of rail in Australia. They indicate, I believe, where we have come from and where we have got to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in Adelaide it was reported that it was not until October 1851 that the Government assumed financial responsibility for the first rail in South Australia. The construction commenced in 1853. In 1856 the broad gauge line was opened as the first steam operated railway in that State. It was from Port Adelaide to Adelaide. After the completion of that line, the northern line to Gawler was constructed in 1857 and extended to Kapunda, a copper mining town, in 1860. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1870s a number of comparatively short narrow gauge railways were constructed&mdash;a horrifying feature, as it turned out, in subsequent readjustments to the rail gauge that were required. The narrow gauge railway from Port Pirie had been extended to Peterborough by 1881 and its further extension to the New South Wales border at Cockburn was authorised in 1884. By 1887 this railway was completed and in 1888 the line beyond Cockburn linked Broken Hill by rail with Port Pirie and Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, whilst one must decry the fact that those different gauges were built, there is no doubt that the railway played an enormous role in the development of the primary industries of Australia. The completion of the line to Broken Hill commenced an ongoing connection between Broken Hill and South Australia and provided the essential link for the export of the ores from Broken Hill. Services commenced to Perth in 1917 following the Commonwealth Railways construction of that line to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked on from that early mention of the development of railway in South Australia to a letter to the South Australian Minister of Transport, Mr Blevins, in 1990 from his Federal counterpart about the closure of the regional passenger services in South Australia. We had come full circle since 1856 until 1991 when the State closed its last passenger service. It did so on the basis that the costings outlined in the Minister's letter indicated how impossible it was to maintain that service. The Blue Lake service, for instance, had a full cost of $3.37m per year and revenue of $O.62m, a cost recovery of 18.4 per cent. Other examples were given on other remaining regional passenger services of a cost recovery of 21.2 per cent and, as low as 16.6 per cent to Silver City. The letter from the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) ended with the paragraph beginning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to authorise AN to close these services by the end of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that was a full circle as far as South Australian passenger railways were concerned. I read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Encyclopedia</EMPHASIS> of another aspect of railway development in Australia <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the presentation of a report on rail standardisation to the Federal Parliament in 1956, a number of projects were conducted with a view to standardising the gauge on the major mainland trunk routes. The longest of these is the 3961 kilometres Sydney-Perth line and, as nearly 68 per cent of this was of standard gauge, the decision to adopt standard as the uniform gauge was taken. A standard gauge line between Wodonga, on the Murray River, and Melbourne, was opened in 1962. Six years later a standard-gauge line reached Kalgoorlie . . . to link with the existing Trans-Australian standard-gauge line from Port Pirie, and the Port Pirie to Broken Hill . . . link was completed. In January 1970 the first freight train crossed the continent, from coast-to-coast, without a break of gauge.</PARA>
<PARA>I read about another development under the heading `Private Railways'. This excerpt goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have the following features in common:  location in the remote Pilbara region of north-western Australia, single-purpose iron ore haulage, single-track diesel operation, very high axle-loads to 35 tonnes, very long trains (up to 240 cars for 30,000 tonnes gross), and very modern technology . . . The traffic density on the Pilbara lines is up to 70 million gross tonnes annually over a single track and their productivity, as measured in haulage cost . . . is believed to be among the lowest of any railway anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA>Another excerpt, going back to July 1975, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Railways became the Australian National Railways. Also in 1975, agreements were reached between the Australian Government and the Tasmanian . . . Government for the transfer of the Tasmanian Railways to the Australian Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will read one last except from this collection. It is from a media release from my Leader, who in February this year drew attention to the losses in the Australian railway system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Victoria the rail system is currently losing over $5 million per day. . . . Sydney's urban line loses $2.5 million per day.</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting point from all of this collection of mismanagement of Australian railways and the failure to take a national view among regional interests is the description of the railways in the Pilbara where, when a specific purpose had to be served and State governments were not involved and industrial relations were not a hindrance, we have a spectacularly successful transport of those essential products overseas for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this establishment of an Australian National Rail Corporation is a movement away from State interests to the national interest. Yet, of course, the two absolutely coincide. We are not separate kingdoms; the success of a National Rail Corporation will be the success of State transport organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways it has been the politics of States that has prevented them from modernising their railways. I know, from personal experience, how difficult it has been for State governments to face the political backlash of closing down inefficient rail services within their own territories. When we consider that many State governments over the years, because of the political process, have survived simply by a majority of one or two, and that one or two can be lost by altering the railway system in particular electorates, we can see how difficult it has been for them to take brave and firm action in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the labour movement has used the rail systems of Australia for some of the most extreme featherbedding in this nation. I think one of the speakers from this side of the House mentioned yesterday that there are still 40 manually operated rail gates in Victoria. Can one think of greater featherbedding in this technological age than to have 40 manually operated rail gates?  It is a ridiculous situation!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have watched the success of Australian National in local areas of South Australia since it has taken over the country rail lines. One watched the spread of efficiency in the manning of the rail stock and, in particular, in the staffing levels on many of the railway stations throughout the State. It may be unfortunate for many local communities that so many local rail stations have been closed. That has been difficult for local towns. However, it has been one of the facts of life that no longer could staffs of two or four or six remain in small country towns to serve a decreasing patronage by railway passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, by the very spread of the political risk as well as its national viewpoint, has been able to move very directly and effectively to remove the featherbedding that used to occur in the South Australian railways. Indeed, Commonwealth Railways&mdash;renamed, as it was in 1975, Australian National&mdash;has shown what can be done when the political incapacity of a State government is broached as it was then by the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other States, as I seem to remember, were all offered the opportunity to purchase their railway systems by the Whitlam Administration. Only South Australia and Tasmania responded. It was unfortunate that the South Australian Government under Mr Don Dunstan squandered the money it got from the Commonwealth in duties, many of which should have been performed in social areas by the Commonwealth in other ways. But that is another matter and is quite subsidiary to the success of the sale or the transfer of ownership of the South Australian railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that the Whitlam Government was not deft enough, if I can use that phrase, and was not cooperative enough to envisage a corporation such as has now been envisaged. It ought not to offend the sensibilities and sense of proprietorship of States about their railway systems. They all have input through the Corporation and, in a sense, they are not selling out, if they take that parochial view, their rail interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflect on the funding of roads in relation to railways. I refer to the excerpt from the Minister's speech in which he referred to the Industry Commission's reference to the increase in domestic product that could be obtained by better management and better funding of road and rail systems. The bulk of the advantage came from the refurbishment of rail systems. One can ask generally why Federal governments have paid so much attention to the funding of roads, yet been so neglectful of addressing the burden of rail. Has it been that rail has been seen simply as unnecessary or ineffective or a sideline operation in the transport question?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Labor Government the motorist in Australia has become a milch cow for taxation. The Minister for Land Transport, who is sitting at the table, would know what dramatic increases there have been in the excise on fuel. I do not have the figure to hand, but I think it was something in the order of 9c or 10c a litre when the Government came to office and now it stands at about 25c. I mention this in relation to overall funding of transport because there is no longer, and there has not been for a long while&mdash;because the Hawke Government and the Keating Government destroyed it&mdash;any relationship between the collection of taxation from fuel and its expenditure on roads. The Government quite destroyed the relationship. As the Minister knows, 6c or 7c from the sale of each litre of fuel is spent on roads. So of the 25c which the Government collects, 19c do not go back to be spent on roads; only 6c or 7c go to roads. It would seem to me that there is no relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government therefore says, `We will have a road program of such and such an amount', which has been inadequate. The Government has not provided what it ought to have provided for the road program. It has simply looked at roads. Until now, nine years into office, it has basically ignored the rail system. One has to ask why it took so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I can go back further than that, and I do not put that wholly on this Government. National governments have ignored the sensibilities and the importance of rail, this Government more than any other, and at a time when it has made an art form of milking the motorist. I do not know that any other taxation has increased so much and with such a dramatic effect in Australia. I suppose it is almost the first priority of this coalition to address this question of the cost of transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister sitting at the table, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), in his very able address in this debate explained fully the attitudes of the coalition in this regard. The taking away of excise&mdash;which is quite the opposite of this Government's implementation of it, which as I said is an art form of taxation&mdash;will revitalise road transport and at the same time will put an even greater emphasis on the need to make rail competitive, because road will be more competitive. Therefore this is an even more urgent proposition under coalition policy than it is for this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I again make reference to what have been the problems with Australian rail. It is intended that the Corporation break even in three years and be self-sufficient in five years. That is enormously rapid progress. I wish it well and I hope it can achieve that, but looking back over its problems I must say that it will require management of the highest order to achieve these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian rail has been caught in a time warp with residues of our development as colonies, with an ineffectual system of Federation to develop a national rail plan and with the States' subservience to their political survival when making decisions to effectively rejuvenate rail. Above all, there has been the industrial featherbedding obtained by the union movement in all the railways of Australia except Australian National. These were the impediments in the round in the past, and for this Corporation to be successful they all have to be broken. Indeed, this has to be a green fields operation. Problems in the national scene, the industrial scene, will all be remedied and rectified so that we will have a new day and we will move away, as I said when I began, from the darker side of Australian politics where our type of federation has prevented the development, for decades, of the essential rail transport that we need. I certainly hope that the Corporation succeeds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;First of all I want to thank all honourable members who have participated in this debate on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1992 and to indicate as well how greatly I have been encouraged by the positive responses that we have heard. There have been differences on matters of detail, but in general there has been a very clear indication of support and a very high level of commitment from both sides of the House, as there should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) referred to the fact that this Government has been in office for nine years. The Australian Labor Party was in office in the postwar period, say, for only the last four years of the 1940s and for only four years in the early 1970s, and it did not come back into government until 1983. That is typical of the period in which the Labor Party has had the opportunity to govern federally since Federation. The honourable member knows, because of his own involvement, particularly in the government of South Australia, that the greater part of this century has seen the Federal Parliament dominated by conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to draw the obvious connections, but I will say on this occasion that the most significant initiatives as far as road and rail transport is concerned have been undertaken by Labor governments. The other major initiative was undertaken by another Labor government during the early 1970s, and it would be derelict on my part and ungracious in the extreme if I did not draw attention to and pay credit to the great vision that Gough Whitlam had about the possibilities of Australian rail. As the honourable member for Boothby indicated, had it not been for the fact that only South Australia and Tasmania responded to that offer, we certainly would not be considering this initiative now. But we are considering it and, as I say, it is of great importance and will become of increasing importance. I appreciate enormously the level of support which has been apparent from honourable members on both sides of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am disappointed that I was not able to be here personally to hear some of the outstanding contributions to the debate, including your own, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you and the other honourable members who participated in the debate that while I was not in the chamber I heard most of it on our internal monitoring system. My responses will indicate that I am very conscious of the points that were raised and of the need for me to respond to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall benefits as far as the Australian community is concerned have been indicated by some of the studies which have been undertaken. This Government's commitment has not just been empty rhetoric: we have backed it with national taxpayers' dollars. Our initial commitment to the National Rail Corporation involved a funding commitment of those national taxpayers' dollars of about $300m. In addition to that, under the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) another $450m was allocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise of course that they are national taxpayers' dollars. I have not heard one person criticise that. Those commitments have been universally endorsed, welcomed and applauded. People know that there is a need for us to re-examine the role of rail as one of the important land transport modes. The rail reform generally has been indicated by the Industry Commission to have the potential to add every year to gross domestic product $4.5 billion of that $6 billion, to which the honourable member for Boothby and other honourable members referred, which could result from reform including the achievement of world-type standards across the whole area of land transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that $4.5 billion could be added to gross domestic product, the annual operating deficit for all rail services&mdash;both freight and passenger, intrastate and interstate, across Australia&mdash;is running at the rate of about $4 billion a year. The national community is becoming increasingly conscious of that and increasingly concerned about it. Governments have a responsibility to respond not only because the national community is concerned, but also because governments should accept the responsibility of doing something about it; and of course we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the National Rail Corporation&mdash;again based on the analysis by the Industry Commission&mdash;has the potential to add, by itself, $1.4 billion every year to gross domestic product. That is a significant benefit and it is something from which no government worth its salt would ever turn away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compliments have been paid from both sides of the House to AN and the way in which it has been able to establish a method of operation which is commercially oriented, efficient, aggressive and successful. I endorse all of those comments. I make the point that since 1983, AN has reduced its call on national taxpayers' dollars by 70 per cent in real terms. That is a very significant improvement. It has shown what a commercially based rail operation is capable of doing. To a very large extent, our willingness as a Commonwealth government to become involved in this area has been underpinned by the success of AN and the fact that it has shown what can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pay tribute to all of the departmental officers who have been involved in this exercise for the advice they have brought to us, the negotiations they have undertaken with officers at State level, and for all of the effort that has gone into what is recognised quite clearly as a difficult exercise: to bring together State systems with all of the inherent safeguards of a Federal system and to get coordination, cooperation and effective operations of the kind that we are now putting into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to respond to a couple of matters before I go on to some more general responses to issues that were raised. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) asked whether or not the National Rail Corporation would be subject to local government rates. The answer is yes; like any other corporation, it will be responsible for all charges and all taxes. It will be treated just the same as any other corporation. The only difference in its structure and its legal responsibilities is the fact that it is owned by governments on behalf of the Australian people and on behalf of the constituencies of the various participating State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is relevant then to one of the questions asked by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). He asked whether the break-even position at the end of the three-year transition period would involve the Corporation in covering all of its costs. The answer is yes: not only operating costs but also any debt servicing and depreciation, and so on. All of the costs attributed to the operation of the National Rail Corporation should be covered by the annual revenue after three years. At the end of the five-year establishment period it should be able to stand on its own feet, funding also its investment programs and so on. As we know, the total investment program&mdash;including our contribution&mdash;will be something like $1.7 billion over 10 years. All Australians will get the benefits of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, how personally delighted I am to have been involved in this process. I do not want to denigrate any governments or any of those people who have had responsibility for this area in the past. It is always very easy for us to look back and say what should have been done. The important thing is what we are doing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was just a matter of three or four years ago that one had to look hard to find anyone on the ground who had any interest in rail or rail reform. They were very thin on the ground. Rail was becoming irrelevant. As has been pointed out, there was that $4 billion in total operating deficit for all of our rail systems each year. It included the annual combined deficit for interstate freight systems of almost $400m. We will knock that out within three years. I expect it to be knocked out because no-one has challenged the methodology upon which those forecasts were based&mdash;including those people who at the present time have the responsibility for the carriage of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to include in my credits the work that was undertaken by Ted Butcher; Vince Graham, who is now the chief executive; all of the board members and all of the people who participated in any way. It really has been an excellent outcome. To a large extent, I suppose it continues the vision of Gough Whitlam. He was a great enthusiast of rail reform&mdash;not in the sense of being a rail buff, as many of us are; but in the sense of being a rail analyst: a person who understands and has always understood the potential of this nation and the things that we can achieve. Gough has continued his interest in this area and I know that he endorses the efforts we are making to continue to pursue the sorts of objectives that he set in place&mdash;even if we do it in a slightly different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other matters have been raised in the debate and I want to clarify as many of those as I have the opportunity to. With the creation of the National Rail Corporation, rail is now clearly entering a new era. It is not more of the same in a different guise. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) pointed out during his contribution, the problem is not one that has appeared since this Labor Government came to power. This Government realised that something had to be done and, as I have said, it has now done it. The National Rail Corporation is the beginning of that new era; it is the new start that rail needs if it is to be an efficient transport operator in the Government's integrated transport strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of honourable members have referred to the need to get the industrial arrangements right. The Government agrees with that absolutely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member understands that we are talking about NRC standard practice identified on the basis of the quality of the capital that we have to work with. The rail unions asked whether or not they should be expected to provide a silk purse with a sow's ear. When they talked about a sow's ear, the honourable member knows that they were talking about the quality of that capital investment and often the quality of management&mdash;the over-manning, the work practices and a lack of commitment on the part of people who are responsible for those services. This has been made perfectly clear: we expect the best to be achieved with the quality of material which is available. Until all of those things are put into place, we will not be making any of those capital commitments. That has been made perfectly clear; there is no question about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing the National Rail Corporation, the Commonwealth and the States agreed that to be successful the Corporation would need the right mix of commercial management, capital investment and a greenfields industrial enterprise award. This award, which is currently being negotiated by the Corporation and the rail unions, will incorporate best practice industrial arrangements which reflect the most efficient work and manning practices, determined by the technical capacity of the equipment and by obvious commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to getting these arrangements right was reiterated in the One Nation statement, which was delivered by the Prime Minister in February. The Government will be seeking firm commitments to a greenfields enterprise award from rail unions and from States to accelerate rail reform in their rail systems. A question was also asked about what are the best practice industrial arrangements which the NRC is required to attain. These are precisely defined in clause B of the recitals to the agreement and are, as a minimum, those identified by the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force in attachment 1 to its report of 21 March 1991.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) pointed out earlier in the debate, it is not just that industrial arrangements need to be right, but also that management practices in the rail industry need to change, and there must be additional investment in rail infrastructure. This Government has supported these initiatives as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new management team is at the helm of this new rail company. In addition, the Government will be injecting capital funds to allow the National Rail Corporation to undertake carefully targeted, high return investments that will improve efficiencies and reduce costs. In addition to the equity the shareholders will be providing, the Prime Minister announced Commonwealth funding for a standard gauge rail network from Brisbane to Perth, including connections to ports. More efficient and reliable rail services will bring wider benefits to the community. This is a key factor in improving our overall competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major projects under that proposal have been indicated. There will be improved intermodal connections to the ports of Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Fremantle. They will increase the efficiency of the interface between road, rail and sea. This will benefit shippers not only by reducing transfer times and costs but also by stimulating greater competition between Australian ports. I assure the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) that a standard gauge railway between Brisbane and Perth is commercial. I am surprised that the doubt was raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it was not for the initiative of the Labor Government, this proposal would not have been undertaken for at least the next few years. However, I expect that improving transit times and the reliability of the rail network will be key commercial goals of the NRC. The NRC will take on the interstate functions and associated assets of the existing rail systems. The remaining functions will remain with the existing rail systems and it will be up to each government to consider what it intends to do with its residual railways. I cannot speak for the Victorian Government, or any other government, but the Commonwealth Government will be considering this matter in relation to Australian National, its prime responsibility, in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate, it was suggested that the capital base for the NRC is inadequate. That is incorrect. Perhaps the cause of confusion is that voting shares are set in the first five years. In this period, voting shares are set at the level agreed by the shareholders and set out in the schedule to the agreement. Cash and assets contributed are reflected by the issue of A convertible shares. At the end of the establishment period, these are converted to ordinary voting shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the NRC's capital program will be complemented by the $454m I have already referred to as arising from the Prime Minister's One Nation statement of 26 February. In addition, the shareholders' agreement allows the shareholders to make additional equity payments should these be required. As this would be done via the corporate plan process, any dispute among shareholders would be settled by the special mechanism set out to resolve disputes over the corporate plan. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable members have referred to concerns that the referral of power by States to the NRC to engage in intrastate trade should be irrevocable. I agree with those honourable members that it would place the Commonwealth in an awkward position if, after referring a power, States were to turn around and revoke it; but that is the nature of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite also referred to the mechanism for resolving disputes, particularly in relation to the transfer of assets to the National Rail Corporation. The point they were trying to make was not perfectly clear to me. I emphasise the fact that the National Rail Corporation is subject to the same laws and commercial practices as is any other company operating in the marketplace; there are no, nor should there be any, special arrangements for the NRC. The mechanism is clearly set out in the shareholders' agreement and all parties have agreed to this process. The process is to try to resolve any disputes, first, by way of conciliation and, if this does not succeed, then by arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern was also expressed about the 49 per cent cap on any individual shareholding. There is in place a mechanism whereby it is possible, as a result of the development of shareholding and arrangements between the participating shareholders, for a single shareholder to acquire more than 50 per cent of the total voting stock with the concurrence of the other partners. The approval of the corporate plan is clearly provided for in the shareholders' agreement and that will be the way in which the Corporation will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Shortland pointed out, the fact is that the Commonwealth policy is not to favour one mode of transport over another, but to encourage each mode to undertake the tasks to which each is best suited. The emphasis in rail is therefore on the long distance carriage of bulk freight with assistance being provided to the National Rail Corporation to carry it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some other particular issues that I would have liked to have responded to, but if honourable members who have participated feel that my response has been inadequate on any of the particular issues that they have raised, I would be more than happy to respond to them personally, directly or by letter. I repeat my appreciation for the way in which people have participated in what has been an historic debate in this Parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> That is a very generous gesture on the part of the shadow Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend says, on occasions the Opposition is capable of being both gracious and generous. I refer to the question of the resolution of disputes. I indicated that the process is to try to resolve any of those disputes, first, by way of conciliation and, if this does not succeed, then by arbitration. The intention was to avoid any lengthy, costly, legalistic or bureaucratic processes and of course that has now been built into the processes that have been agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also referred briefly to the approval of the corporate plan. I went on to say that the approval requires 75 per cent of the vote for the plan to be successfully approved. However, if for some reason during that establishment period one of the shareholders seeks to frustrate the approval process, a deadlock breaking mechanism can be invoked. That mechanism provides that, if the plan is not approved within 30 days, it can be approved if all shareholders, bar one, agree, irrespective of the number of shares each shareholder has. Given the need for shareholders to earn a return on their investment in the National Rail Corporation, it is unlikely that any two members would seek to frustrate a commercially driven corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of privatisation was raised as well. Some people suggested to me in the early stages of this process that the Federal Government was seeking to develop a successful national rail system in order to sell it off to private enterprise. I said that, if private investors came hammering at my door for a share of the action, I would applaud their attempt because that would show that we had been successful. At present there is no way in the world that private investors would seek to have a share of a loss-making operation. But when they start hammering at the doors of future governments to have a share, to be given the opportunity to invest in it, then governments will be able to say that the venture is successful, that it is profitable and that it has a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that includes the question that was raised by the honourable member for Bendigo about whether shares would be available to employees. The answer to that is that some time in the future it is likely that they will be. But again, the same issue applies: would anyone at this stage, apart from governments acting on behalf of the nation, be particularly interested in pursuing it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are about to commence debating the Asian Development Fund Bill. It provides for Australia's contribution to the Asian Development Fund for the period 1992 to 1995 and it amounts to $350m. Out of a total membership of 47 countries, 32 of them being regional, that is, within the Asian region, and 15 non-regional, Australia is the fourth largest donor to the Asian Development Fund and has been an active supporter of it since its creation in 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank was created with the principal objective of encouraging economic growth and development in Asia and the Far East including the South Pacific. To this end, the bank promotes investment in public and private capital for development purposes; it provides loans for the encouragement of growth; it coordinates the economic development plans and policies of its member states; it provides technical assistance to help prepare, finance and implement development projects and programs; and, of course, it cooperates with relevant United Nations agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Asian Development Bank has the objective of assisting all developing countries within its region, it pays special attention to the smaller and the least developed of them. To this end, the bank provides technical assistance to generate more projects for the Asian Development Bank financing, it provides a greater share of funds to less developed countries, it provides loans at highly concessional terms, and it finances local currency expenditures by lending foreign exchange to the recipients concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian Development Fund, as distinct from the bank, was established in 1974 as a means of financing loans on concessional terms to the most needy members. In general, the lower the debt repayment capacity of a country, the greater the need for what they call a soft loan under the Asian Development Fund. Accordingly, countries have been divided into three groups. Group A includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Butuan, Burma, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, India, Kiribati, Laos, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Vanuatu, Vietnam and Western Samoa. Group B includes such countries as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Thailand. Group C includes Fiji, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of Australian development assistance is largely multilateral and it takes the form of contributions to international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank. The second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) indicates that Australia intends to consolidate this approach by increasing its international financial institutions payments as a share of the total aid budget from 8 per cent, as it was in the mid-1980s, to over 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not opposing the commitment of funds to the Asian Development Bank&mdash;and this Bill will obviously have our support&mdash;we are concerned about the increasing proportion of the global aid budget going to development banks at the expense of bilateral and other multilateral aid programs. Multilateral aid agencies, principally banks, have a charter which directs them to promote programs aimed at more directly reducing poverty, narrowing income disparities and creating employment in developing countries. The extensive literature assessing the role and performance of multilateral banks, however, suggests that they have been less than successful in fulfilling that charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of studies have indicated that the multilateral banks have, to a limited extent, been able to direct their programs to the poorest of the poor while numerous others suggest that they have not been able to channel their loans to the lowest income groups. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that members of this Parliament have been raising these matters, particularly in relation to one of the other organisations, the World Bank and its fund, for exactly this reason. Other studies have claimed that multilateral aid programs, in fact, significantly contribute to perpetuating the economic relationships which are in place and which are at the root of so much of the rural poverty that we see not only within our own region but elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Virtually all research, however, indicates that the reorientation of programs of multilateral aid agencies towards poverty alleviation has encountered severe political and organisational constraints and raises questions on how these constraints can be overcome. The Asian Development Bank itself came under severe criticism in the 1980s for emphasising the annual expansion of loan approvals while, at the same time, disregarding developmental, technical and economic aspects of its projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I know that you have taken a good deal of interest in, Mr Deputy Speaker, has noted that there have been occasions when the bank has forgone the scrupulous adherence to the highest standards in its preparation of project appraisals. For the time that I was a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;and we looked at aid questions&mdash;the Asian Development Bank was a matter of some considerable comment and concern. Our ability to influence the bank and its policies was constrained by the fact that very often the representation that we had was at a Treasury level. The aid emphasis was obtained largely on a consultancy basis from Australia's specialised staff in AIDAB. Of course, when it came to looking at matters relating to the staffing of the bank, those countries that had perhaps greater contributions were able to play a disproportionate role in the selection of staff and their management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that members of this Parliament, through the parliamentary committee structure, had some comments to make about those matters and when complaints were made, it was very difficult for Australia to play a role in ensuring that those matters were satisfactorily reviewed. This arises when one is making contributions to agencies in which other countries and their people employed in those organisations also have a role. Wider sensitivities need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The bank's lack of cooperation and response to committee inquiries led to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade noting that Australia demands the highest standards in accountability and disclosure and, if this is not forthcoming, continued support for the bank's management cannot be assumed. That is a matter on which members of this Parliament have had a view and they have put it strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these matters, a panel of experts was established to look into the operations of the bank in the 1990s. I understand that it has made some progress. Relations between Australia and the bank, I am informed, have improved significantly as a result of those efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Asian Development Fund has been able to achieve some of its goals and objectives, Australia should continue to make a significant contribution. Only by doing so will we be able to have more influence over the direction of the bank and priority of its projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that while the Government has been proportionately increasing the amount of aid that is funded through the World Bank and through the Asian Development Bank&mdash;in other words, through the international financial institutions; as I mentioned earlier, with the increase from 8 to 18 per cent&mdash;I understand that Australia's share in relation to the Asian Development Fund and to this particular replenishment is lower in proportionate terms than the replenishments that we have contributed to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, that is a reflection not only of our commitments to the World Bank but also upon Australia's economic circumstances and prospects. In other words, we need to understand that Australia's ability to contribute these very substantial amounts of money&mdash;and we are talking about $350m over a three-year period&mdash;is constrained by our own economic success or otherwise in this country. Our very ability to influence the direction and success of development aid through the bank is more constrained and limited when the contributions that we are making are proportionately diminishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this worsening economic climate and with further reductions to the overall aid budget, Australia has to look at whether, when it is operating through other agencies, the funds that we do have available are best maintained in organisations such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. We also have to ask ourselves whether the contributions between those two organisations&mdash;the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank&mdash;are appropriate. Obviously the World Bank is a larger body in which our influence would be correspondingly smaller than it is in the Asian Development Bank, where we are the fourth largest contributor, as I mentioned. The coalition sees quite clearly that Australia's economic and political future lies in the Asia-Pacific; hence our support for the Asian Development Bank. Our influence over its activities ought to increase in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a moment I will talk about foreign aid, but I do want to take up this question in relation to our influence within this region. This matter has been the subject of very considerable comment in recent days. Honourable members would be aware that the Prime Minister&mdash;who has in the past taken an interest in these matters largely through his involvement as Australia's representative in relation to many of these financial bodies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank&mdash;is only now, through the official visits that he is paying to countries within our own region, taking an interest in these relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern to us that these latter-day interests are developing. We are not critical of their developing but we are critical of the fact that they have been so long coming. In fact, in the past the Prime Minister has spent more time flying over Asia than he has spent in Asia representing Australia's interests, familiarising himself with the situation of the countries within our region and developing relationships with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a new matter for the Opposition. Well before the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) became a member of this Parliament, he had extensively visited the Asia-Pacific region both privately and in the capacity of his previous employment. On assuming the role of Leader of the Opposition in the early 1990s, he paid official visits to eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. By pulling out a copy of the address that he made upon his return from that visit, I reminded myself about the breadth and depth of contact that the Leader of the Opposition had. He met with numerous heads of state: President Aquino in the Philippines; in Singapore, the then head of state, Mr Lee Kuan Yew; in Indonesia, President Suharto; and in Papua New Guinea, Mr Namaliu. In addition, he had discussions with the first Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, in Singapore, and with the Prime Minister of Korea, Mr Kang Young-hoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also met with foreign Ministers in South Korea, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as well as deputy foreign Ministers in Thailand and Malaysia. He had discussions with defence Ministers in Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see that the Leader of the Opposition had a wide range of contacts and associations upon which he was able to draw. On his return, he emphasised the importance of the relationship between economics and foreign policy. In relation to the visit he undertook to China, he was able to talk about not only our relationships but also Australia's interest in human rights issues. He was prepared to take that up in a very forceful way with a good deal of success from the point of view of an Opposition raising these matters rather than the Government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the Leader of the Opposition looked at the wider issue of refugees in Indo-China. He spent a good deal of time assessing the question personally in relation to Cambodia, assessing our ongoing relationship with Vietnam and, of course, assessing the interest that other countries within our region took in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Spelt out very clearly by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;right from the time that he assumed these responsibilities&mdash;was his commitment to this region. The time that he spent in Papua New Guinea, well in advance of the recent particularly important anniversary celebrations, gave him an opportunity to emphasise Australia's&mdash;particularly the coalition's&mdash;strong support for Papua New Guinea and our ongoing commitment to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at that time that the Leader of the Opposition said that we should have a `year of Asia' in Australia. He reiterated the theme of the Opposition's aims to implement policies which would make Australia a major political and economic force in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2000. He emphasised that we had set ourselves this goal because, notwithstanding the importance of our ties with Europe and the Americas, we believe that our future lies in the Asia-Pacific region. He was talking about the maintenance of our traditional friendships and the ongoing task of developing the important relationships within our region. They can complement each other; they are not exclusive. One does not have to terminate one to be able to commence another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinary time for Australia. At the moment, we are seeing an emphasis upon the region&mdash;a new emphasis as far as the Prime Minister is concerned&mdash;that is predicated upon terminating other relationships, abandoning old friendships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter explored&mdash;this has come up in other contexts but it is very relevant to this&mdash;is the respect that countries have for a person who takes his domestic disputes before them. A very good and dear friend of mine&mdash;a migrant from China who has been quite successful in business in Australia&mdash;asked me whether I could obtain for him an Australian flag to hang proudly in his premises. He could not understand why anybody would want to take a family dispute out and exercise it amongst one's neighbours. Yet, we have had the Prime Minister of this country, in the first major visit that he has paid to a country in the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;our nearest neighbour, Indonesia&mdash;taking an Australian domestic situation before it in a way which I do not think countries within our region would ever do with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the point that I really wanted to make in the context of Australia's ability to continue programs of support within this region. One cannot have support in programs of this sort without a strong Australian economy. If one is going to have influence within the region, one cannot expect to have it without a strong economy at home. The Asian Development Bank is a marvellous case study, because the principal country that influences that body is, in fact, Japan. Not so long ago Japan invaded many of the countries within this region; it was an occupying force. The commemoration in Papua New Guinea during the last few days was about our involvement 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has had to develop its influence within this region notwithstanding the impact that that invasion had. It has been able to do so, not because it is an easy path for it to tread&mdash;it is much easier for Australia, which has never been an occupying power&mdash;but because of the force of its own economy. Countries in the region ultimately have to deal with Japan if they are going to be able to get support through programs directly on a bilateral basis or multilaterally through agencies like the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is going to have influence in organisations like the Asian Development Bank&mdash;if it is going to have influence within our own region&mdash;first and foremost, we have to see that we have restored the international competitiveness of our economy. History, our culture, our constitutional structure or our flag will not determine the respect that other nations have for us; the respect they will have for us will be there if we are a strong, internationally competitive economy. That is really the crux of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be one of the economically dynamic countries of Asia, it is not a matter of our trying to coat-tail on their success; it is a matter of our being able to maximise our opportunities through our own success. That has to be achieved by our undertaking the reforms necessary in our own economy to achieve that growth. We need to become an outward looking international economy rather than an inward looking economy, constrained by all of the problems that we are so familiar with: our trade unions and our labour market; the vision of Australian entrepreneurs and Australian management; and the very considerable costs that governments impose on doing business in Australia. All of these matters need to be addressed if we are to restore growth and dynamism to the Australian economy. This will ensure that other countries within our region have respect for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is nothing new. This is a matter about which the Opposition has been talking for a long period. The fact is that under the Hawke Government&mdash;and largely with the current Prime Minister, but then as Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;foreign policy in relation to this region was never given the priority that it deserved. One can go back and look at the situation in relation to Malaysia, where our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) found himself persona non grata. The same problem existed in relation to Fiji. There were problems in relation to the South-Pacific Forum meeting in Vila where the Prime Minister irritated Pacific Island heads as a result of his tactless attempt to twist arms to accept the US proposals for chemical waste disposal. Quite significant problems within our region have been perpetuated by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Opposition, I make it very clear that we do have a commitment to the importance of Australia's foreign aid program to alleviate human suffering and underdevelopment in the world. It is important to focus on the quality of our aid program as well as on its quantity. If I had more time to speak on this matter in this debate, I would cover those aspects in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I mention that it is also important to recognise that Australians ought to have a proper view on human rights issues in relation to development assistance. That is an important question which, if we look at the attitude that Australia has taken recently in relation to China and more recently Indonesia, should be of continuing interest and concern to the Government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this Bill, I draw attention to those matters. We, in the Opposition, support the legislation and will continue to monitor carefully the way in which the funding is provided. We certainly emphasise the importance of bilateral aid as well as the multilateral contributions that are made through organisations like the Asian Development Fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a zero worth having. This is a big O. This is a zero worth having for Australia. It is just another indication of the kind of improving fundamental base which will underpin the forecast economic recovery as outlined by the Prime Minister in his One Nation statement. The CPI figure also supports recent revised official forecasts of reduced inflation in 1991-92 and, most importantly, in 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March quarter CPI of zero per cent means that inflation over the past 12 months is just 1.7 per cent, a slight rise on the 12 months to December because of the negative impact of the CPI figure in the March quarter 12 months ago. The underlying rate, which excludes volatile and seasonal factors, has declined from 3.4 per cent in the December quarter to around 3 per cent for the March quarter. This sets another record low since this series was first constructed in 1971. The consolidation of low inflation and of lower inflation expectations means that inflationary expectations should now be 3 per cent or lower. Of course, this is a further indication of the fundamental basis on which a recovery can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have retail sales continuing to improve, motor vehicle sales have shown steady improvement, even if last month's strong growth is discounted somewhat for the effects of the cut in sales tax. Of course, the housing sector continues to improve as well. In relation to the official inflation estimates, there has now been a revision of the 1991-92 figure, down from the 2 1/4 per cent which was included in One Nation now to 2 per cent for this year. The inflation estimate for 1992-93 has been revised down a full percentage point from 3 1/2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent for that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provides a very important measure of the Government's policy flexibility and it has an implication for monetary policy. Of course, inflation is not the only factor which informs our deliberations and those of the bank in relation to monetary policy. But this provides an opportunity for some relaxation of monetary policy, the extent of which is to be determined in the course of consultations between the Government and the Reserve Bank during the next few days. This will provide an opportunity to return to the people of Australia a dividend for the improved position as far as inflation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition deciding to turn his attention towards employment. As each of these statistics comes out and as each of these indications of progress and success comes about, he is reduced to a more and more constrained field of attack. But how could he possibly attack us on the question of economic performance? When we go back to the period, which the Prime Minister referred to, of nine years ago, we see that the Leader of the Opposition was advising the then Government in relation to economic policy. The only zero that it could find then was a zero that had a one in front of it in relation to inflation and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what happened in relation to inflation in the 12 months before our election. In the period going up to March 1983, we had, in March 1982, inflation of 10.58 per cent; the next quarter, we had inflation of 12.32 per cent; we then had 11.01 per cent; and we had 11.54 per cent in the March quarter of 1983&mdash;the time when there was a change of government. In that quarter&mdash;the quarter where there was 11.54 per cent&mdash;we had unemployment just a touch under 10 per cent, and it rose to 10 per cent just after that. These people on the other side of the House are the ones who were able to achieve that appalling result of double digit inflation coinciding with double digit unemployment. That is the great difference between now and then. We have inflation down to its lowest level since 1971, providing the context in which we can see a return to growth and an improvement in the labour market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is, of course, before many of the major initiatives in the One Nation package are having their impact upon the economy, which will be a beneficial impact. Today, as the Treasurer has said, we have seen a remarkable gain on inflation. We have seen the consolidation of low inflation, by a Labor Government, for the first time in two decades. We have seen this Government do what the conservatives were not able to do, and that is break the back of double digit inflation. These people say they were the party of business, the people who were able to manage the rest of us, but when the oil shocks came along and inflation and wage growth came along, they were unable to do anything about it. As the Treasurer said, they left office with unemployment at levels similar to today's but with inflation at 11.4 per cent instead of, as we have it, at 1.7 per cent&mdash;1.7 per cent, in similar circumstances, to 11.4 per cent. This is a huge national achievement, with an underlying rate of 0.4 per cent for the quarter and 3 per cent for the year&mdash;the lowest rate since statistics were first recorded in 1971. Those low levels have been preserved through the Accord which the Government established and by the operation of monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

He wants to sabotage the inflation rate by the addition of an ideologically, maniacally driven proposal to tax the food and clothing of Australians and their services and to drive the inflation rate back towards double digits.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it really means, and it has been a theme that I have been pushing from this portfolio for some time, is not that we become less reliant on our commodity base but that we do more with it. That is particularly the case in relation to the sugar industry. Reports that have been referred to over recent days demonstrate that there is enormous potential for value adding in the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not going to happen on its own. That is why, quite apart from the broader economic settings that this Government has developed, there are specific programs that can assist industries such as the sugar industry but are not limited to it. Those programs include the marketing skills program; the innovative agricultural marketing program, of which the sugar industry, I might add, has been a recent beneficiary; local government development initiatives that are developed through the office of my colleague the Minister for Local Government; and RIBES, the rural industries business extension service, which was giving to the rural sector what the urban sector had in NIES&mdash;and together with that scheme there was introduced in the last Budget under my submission a business advice for rural areas scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that these are the types of programs that Fightback would abolish in the Opposition's desperate desire to cut back on its government expenditure proposals. Those programs highlight our position when it comes to regional economic development and recognise the need for consultation and working with industry, identifying the impediments to those industries and using programs, such as the ones that I have mentioned, to facilitate genuine development; in other words, they recognise that there is a legitimate proactive role for government in working with industry to get these initiatives going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast where the coalition stands when it comes to regional economic development. Where does it stand in relation to the sugar industry? We had the opportunity to address this in part yesterday. The coalition has not asked a question on it, I might add, despite the furore it has caused within its own ranks. It is locked into a zero tariff position which will be determined by the Industry Commission's report. We already know what the draft report is; we will have to await the outcome of the final report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we outlined in our One Nation statement, the Government will introduce legislation to facilitate the making of enterprise agreements. I believe that through changes to the workplace and particularly through agreements and arrangements which will be encouraged by such agreements, we can enhance productivity growth and improve the pleasure of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise very strongly that it is not the policy of this Government to force employees off awards and into agreements, which is now the real agenda of the Opposition. The honourable member for Bennelong likes to assure people that they will have a choice, under the policies of the coalition, of remaining under awards or entering into so-called voluntary agreements. But the Leader of the Opposition let the truth slip in Perth in January and in New Zealand recently. In Perth he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I could have my way, almost immediately no more wage increases, unless they are negotiated at a workplace by workplace level, all around Australia. No more centralised wage determination. That is the fundamental of the process of change. You can do it.</PARA>
<PARA>He then made it clear in New Zealand when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal coalition is flirting with a plan for swiftly deregulating the labour market by scrapping the awards that provide the real underpinnings of Australia's wage and industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>The piece went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, alluded to a radical change in the coalition's policy and a sharp differentiation from the Government's approach to labour reform during his tour of New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>But every time the Leader of the Opposition steps out of line, the honourable member for Bennelong jumps in with a fix. This time, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our policy is to give people the choice to allow people to go outside the centralised wage system if they wish. If they want to remain within the award system that is okay.</PARA>
<PARA>But at the same time he says that he will abolish centralised wage fixation. The fact is that under this policy, 80 per cent of Australian employees who work under awards would find that they had lost their entitlements to rates of pay, penalty awards, annual leave and working hours. All of the things which have been built up under awards over generations would be just wiped away by such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found the Australian Chamber of Commerce coming out to support this proposal. In a statement, Mr Brent Davis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reported plans by the Federal Opposition to scrap Federal awards are worthy of further debate and should not be dismissed out of hand. While this radical idea has been much discussed within employers' circles and derives from reforms achieved in New Zealand, it is the first time it has been promoted by a senior politician/political leader in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson's big bang approach would certainly destroy one of the major impediments to the necessary quantum shift towards bona fide enterprise bargaining outside the centralised tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Big bang is right. This is the policy setting: in the unlikely consequence of a Hewson government being elected, first of all there would be the addition of five to seven percentage points in the price system to inflation. Overnight the inflation rate would rise towards double digits; overnight the floor under inflation would rise and interest rates would rise with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in his capacity as representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Can the Minister advise the House of the progress the Government has made in bringing about micro-economic reform in road, rail and on the waterfront? What prospects are there for bringing about an effective interface between land and sea transport for the first time in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have that question from the honourable gentleman. I know from experience in the portfolio when I held it that he was a very active man in this area. I understand he has recently been taking some councils and other people interested in regional development in his electorate around the airport, the freeway, rail yards and the waterfront showing them the changes that have been taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is particularly relevant, given the comments being made by the Leader of the Opposition on what is required of Australian statesmen as they visit our neighbours and people further afield. Evidently, what he considers an adequate performance is to present them with a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">!</EMPHASIS> as they sit down and to say, `This is what we intend to do on the waterfront'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was of passing interest that he should have recommended that to the Prime Minister in Indonesia. If he had told the Indonesian President that he thought it was a really terrific idea to put the soldiers in against the Australian watersiders, he might have triggered a memory of when the Indonesians had some reason for considerable gratitude and expressed it to members of the Australian waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of the question goes to the heart of what is micro-economic reform in this country. That is, you can take the process so far with changes in work practices on the waterfront or anywhere else in the transport industry and then you come up to an irreducible minimum. If you are really going to lower costs to people who wish to use those facilities for export, and if you are really going to achieve something for the Australian national economy, you run up against an archaic infrastructure. You cannot get around that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms we have introduced on the waterfront have more than exceeded the targets set in October 1992 when we expected that there would be a cut of one-third in waterfront labour. We have already achieved 40 per cent, and waterfront labour will be halved. The productivity gains have been even greater than anyone had expected. Accordingly, the costs are falling to those who utilise the waterfront. Those reforms will be in place over the next 12 months. Those will be the reforms that are required as far as work practices are concerned on the waterfront. What you then run up against is the fact that you cannot get competition between Australian ports because the infrastructure of our rail transport around the country is archaic and the road-rail interface with the waterfronts is also archaic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement went right to the heart of that. It provided $30m for the standard gauge rail link to Fisherman Islands to enhance the ability of the port of Brisbane to operate land bridging services and hence provide greater competition to southern ports on Pacific basin routes; $20m for the upgrading of Melbourne's Dynon terminal to facilitate the standardisation of the Melbourne-Adelaide railway to allow for improvements to services to Sydney and Brisbane and also to allow the port of Melbourne to compete more effectively with other ports; and $5m for a direct connection between Swanson and Appleton docks and Dynon rail terminal to reduce double handling of containers, reduce cargo handling time and allow the port of Melbourne to compete more effectively with other ports.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend, if you get into office it will be closed with trenches, not with strikes. The statement also provides $8m for the construction of a rail loop at Outer Harbour in Adelaide which will form part of a $100m upgrading of the port. This will provide more competition between ports and involves an innovative approach to reducing delays and costs at the sea-land interface; $13m for improving the Fremantle-Kalgoorlie line to enhance the ability of the port of Fremantle to operate land bridging services to the eastern States; and there are others for the port in Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that anybody who knows anything about the essential elements of micro-economic reform in this country knows that, unless those infrastructure issues are addressed, all promises as far as micro-economic reform and what it might well deliver via the transport sector are concerned are irrelevant, non-attainable. Everybody in the car industry knows this. Everybody in industries that are attempting to export knows that. They know that, when they are presented with options, such as the tariff proposals in the car industry that the Opposition puts forward, and when the Opposition says, `But you will have these other benefits', it is baloney; they know it is nonsense. That is why they are developing this hostility at the inability of the Opposition to understand that it is not going to deliver what it talks about. The Opposition's position on every one of these propositions that I have put forward is to oppose them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a requirement in the future to address further issues. As far as the infrastructure of rail and ports is concerned, this is not going to be the end of the matter. There is absolutely nothing in Fightback which addresses this in terms of enhancing those capacities. All there is in Fightback and in subsequent statements is a decision not to proceed with them and to criticise the Government for doing so. This means that the micro-economic reform position of the Opposition in the transport sector falls flat on its face.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as we saw at the conclusion of Question Time today a monumental exhibition from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country of the contempt in which he holds the Parliament of this country, so it is that over the past few days we have had from a man who has spent 40 years of his life devoted to the broad labour movement in this country the most extraordinary denunciation of the conduct of industrial relations that has ever been delivered by somebody who has held some of the highest positions available in the labour movement. Before I come to the substance of the domination of industrial relations in Australia by the ACTU, and before I come to an analysis of the reasons for Mr Turbet's resignation from the Industrial Relations Commission, let me pick up some words that were uttered by the Prime Minister during Question Time when he rather laboriously, unable to rapidly read a pre-typed answer, tried to denigrate the industrial relations policies of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He tried that old Labor favourite of saying, `If you elect the Liberals you are going to have industrial relations confrontation. You are going to have brother against brother, Australian against Australian, and you are going to divide the country right down the middle'. Not only does that pass rather strange from the lips of a man who has done more over the last weeks to divide this country than any Prime Minister since the end of World War II, but it is also redolent of the fearmongering approach that is adopted by the Australian Labor Party towards anything associated with industrial relations. No matter how scurrilous the claim, no matter how insubstantial the allegations, the clarion call of the Labor Party and the leaders of the labour movement between now and the election campaign will be, `If you elect the Liberals there will be industrial mayhem and confrontation. There will be a wholesale destruction of working conditions', and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing the Labor Party has for sale between now and the next election is fear, loathing and lies. That is all we will get from the Labor Party. From now until the next election there will be no serious putting forward of an alternative policy prescription for this country and there will be no attempt to address the fundamental weaknesses of the Australian economy. There will be lies about our taxation policy; there will be lies about our industrial relations policy; there will be further lies about Australian history. And from now until the next election we will have a campaign of fearmongering and loathing, the like of which we have not yet seen&mdash;all in the name of uniting the Australian nation! After all, the supreme obligation of any Prime Minister of this country is to heal and unite, not to wound and divide. Yet this man has done more to wound and divide the Australian community and he is going to do it in relation to industrial relations, as he has done it in relation to the flag, as he has done it in relation to Australian history, and as he is doing it in relation to the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister talked about confrontation and about industrial mayhem, I was reminded of a discussion that I had in 1977 with the then President of the ACTU. I must say that he was not turned out as well then as he subsequently was as Prime Minister of Australia; nonetheless, there he was as the President of the ACTU. I met him in company with the then head of the Public Service unions, Mr Paul Munro&mdash;who, incidentally, is now a deputy president of the Industrial Relations Commission and a man with whom, I should say, I attended the Sydney University Law School between 1957 and 1960. I am very happy to make his reacquaintance at reunion dinners of students in that particular year. I hold nothing against the man personally; he held a very high union position in this country in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of that meeting was that I, as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, was then responsible for putting into the Parliament section 45D of the Trade Practices Act, which went on to become the most effective weapon available to the business community in Australia against predatory union conduct. I still remember Bob Hawke, as President of the ACTU, jabbing his finger in the air in a very excited way, saying, `Howard, if you go ahead with this, there will be blood in the streets, there will be Australian against Australian, and you will divide the country down the middle'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the warning that Hawke gave. That was the measure of the exaggeration of the then President of the ACTU. I put in the same category the claims made by the Prime Minister today. The reality is that after the next election the ACTU will work with the elected government of this country. It will fulminate and fume and rant and rave between now and the election, but come the verdict of the Australian people installing a coalition government&mdash;as surely as it will at the next election&mdash;those leaders of the ACTU will be knocking on the door of the new Minister for industrial relations on the Monday morning and wanting to sit down and have a discussion with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My response, if I happen to be that Minister, or the response of whoever the Minister will be, will simply be, `Yes, we will deal with you. We will treat you as an important element in Australian society, but we will not invite you in as a member of the Government. We will not hand over to you the administration of industrial relations'. We will not create the sort of thing that Ken Turbet resigned in protest against, and that is an industrial relations system run by the ACTU, of the ACTU and for the ACTU, because that is the industrial relations system that this country has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt in my mind that over the last year we have seen an even greater increase in the power of the ACTU, to the neglect of the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;which, for reasons that I will explain in a moment, is of no great concern to me&mdash;and, importantly, to the denigration of the responsible Minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Bob Hawke was the President of the ACTU, he had a rather endearing description of Bill Kelty, who was a research assistant before he became Secretary. He used to call him the sorcerer's apprentice. I think it can fairly truthfully be said that the apprentice has now become the sorcerer, and far from the Minister becoming the apprentice, I do not think he has even reached the status of being on work experience. If ever there was a devalued, denigrated, irrelevant Minister for industrial relations, it is the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations in this country is run by Bill Kelty and Paul Keating. They are the two who decided a year ago to reject the national wage case decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. My Government friend sitting on the front bench knows as well as I do&mdash;because he does know something about the background of the industrial relations system in this country&mdash;that one of the greatest mistakes the Government ever made in industrial relations in this country was to reject the decision of the full bench a year ago. What the Government was doing was kneecapping its own umpire. It was kneecapping the best friend it had. It was destroying the authority of the self-appointed umpire in the Australian industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not trouble me, because we quite openly want to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. We are quite unashamed about that. We will ask the Parliament of this country to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. We will ask the Parliament of this country to create a situation which effectively abolishes compulsory arbitration. There is no argument about it; there is no secret about it; we are not coy about it. We believe that every worker and every employer in this country should have the right, if they so choose, to make a voluntary arrangement right outside the industrial relations system. We believe in writing a law that will give people an incentive to go outside the system. We will preserve the right, if both parties want to remain within the system, to have their terms and conditions of employment, work practices, hours of work and so forth governed by industrial awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister falsely alleged that workers will have their conditions driven down. They will not. There will be a minimum wage calculated on an hourly rate. There will be minimum requirements regarding such things as annual leave and sick leave. But let me make it abundantly clear to all members of the Government, in case there is any doubt on their side, that we believe that such matters as penalty rates, the length of the working week, overtime, holiday loadings and all of those things that are holding back the needed flexibility in Australia's industrial relations system ought to be matters for negotiation between employers and employees. We do not shy away from that. We do not walk away from it for a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that if 300 overseas tourists arrive in this country at 12 midnight at Tullamarine Airport, they want the same service as that given to 300 foreigners who arrive in this country at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning. But under the ridiculous industrial laws of Australia, it costs about 15 or 20 per cent more to provide those services at 12 midnight than it does at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning. That situation has to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we are witnessing the destruction of the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission within the existing industrial relations system. Whilst that in a sense aids the case of the Opposition, it is taking place in circumstances where power over industrial relations is passing more and more to the ACTU. When Ken Turbet resigned he gave three reasons. Remember that Mr Turbet had been appointed to the Commission in 1977. He was appointed by Tony Street when he was the coalition Minister. Ken Turbet had run one of the largest public sector unions in Australia. He has been a supporter of the labour movement for over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason he gave for resigning was one that would be familiar to all of us and familiar to most Australians&mdash;he did not trust the word of the Government. He said, `I don't trust you'. This is a man of 40 years experience in the labour movement, a man steeped in the tradition of industrial labour. He knows where the bodies are buried. No wonder he wrote to the Minister and said, `I don't trust you. Your word can't be relied upon'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing he complained about was the increasing power of the ACTU. He did not mince words. He said that effectively industrial relations in Australia is run by Kelty and Keating and nobody else, and the idea that it is a consensus is a complete joke. The third thing he complained about was the ignorance of the Minister regarding the constitutional role of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the extraordinary things about the debate initiated by the Prime Minister about our cultural identity is that every so often the Prime Minister says, `The trouble with you blokes over there is that you want to hang onto everything British'. The thing is&mdash;and it occurs in the context of industrial relations&mdash;that we do not want to hang onto everything British; we want to hang onto only those things British that are good and are working, such as a system of constitutional government, a liberal press, the cultural values that we have inherited and are working, and the most comprehensive, evocative language in the world. They are the things we want to hang onto. But I can tell you, brother, that the things British you want to hang onto are the things that are not working&mdash;outdated trade union notions. That is the crazy thing. Every Australian would know that over the last 20 years, anyone who turned on the television set and heard a whingeing shop steward would think not of Belgrade, Rome, Athens or Philadelphia, but of Manchester or Glasgow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Prime Minister not break his cultural cringe to British trade unionism? Why does he not end it? Why does he not understand that we do not want to hang onto things British just because they are British. We want to hang onto things British that are worth preserving. I make no apology for that, and I think we are a better country for having the fortitude and the capacity to pick the good from the bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's problem is that he is locked into a pre-world War I industrial relations system and he is locked into trade union attitudes that owe more to our British connection than to anything else. Can I please ask him: why does he not throw out the bad things British and hang onto the good things British?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an extraordinary contribution from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) which had little, if anything, to do with the supposed subject of the matter of public importance. Anyone listening to this debate should bear in mind at the outset that, if we are talking about industrial relations in this country, then we are talking about one area which is absolutely unarguably an area of great success for this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there has been a marked change in the whole industrial relations environment since this Government came into office. The whole vogue of confrontation, which was the way industrial relations were pursued by the parties, by the Government, in the period until we came into office, was one of massive confrontation. The unions and the employers confronted each other heavily; the Government continually made confrontationist noises and it took confrontationist approaches to the unions. It carried a big stick but got beaten around the head quite often by the trade union movement. It was totally unable to control either industrial relations or the wages outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that has changed since this Government came into office. We have seen a dramatic change in industrial relations. That whole confrontationist approach has gone. That is not to say, of course, that there are no disputes; of course there are disputes, but the basic attitudes of the parties have changed remarkably. There is much more of an air of cooperation in the workplaces of this country now than there has ever been in our history, and it shows up in the industrial dispute figures. There has been a 60 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputation since this Government came into office in terms of working days lost per thousand employees against that experienced under the previous Government. That is a remarkable reduction in industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the wages outcome we see that it has been much lower under this Government. Despite all the confrontation, despite the antagonism, the average wage increase under the Fraser Government was 11.4 per cent; the average wage increase per annum under this Government has been 6.4 per cent, which is remarkably less. The result of that is that we have been able to get costs down compared with what they would have been under the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an inflation rate reduction. Today we have seen an inflation rate of zero for this quarter, an annual rate of 1.7 per cent. A few years ago, in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, we went through a very high level of activity. Normally we would have expected wages to have an absolute blow-out as they did in the early 1980s, but what happened? We had no wages blow-out at all. The wages policy being pursued by this Government and the industrial relations arrangements which were in place were such that it enabled us to have a very good wages outcome, given the level of economic activity. As we have moved into recession, that level of wages outcome has dropped even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing very responsible wages outcomes and greatly reduced levels of industrial disputation enabling a much greater increase in efficiency. Now there is a move to enterprise bargaining, which is a major change in the system of industrial relations in this country, and which has been brought about by agreement between the parties and the Government, with the endorsement, eventually, of the Industrial Relations Commission. This means that we are now moving into an area where industrial relations is being focused much more heavily at the workplace than was ever the case before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is general agreement around the nation that that should happen. Employers and unions have agreed that that is the way things should move. It is the view of both parties in this House. Both the Government and the Opposition agree that that is the way things should go&mdash;although the Opposition wants to take a far more extreme approach. At least industrial relations is moving in the direction of the enterprise level in a quite unambiguous way. That is happening under a system which has been pursued by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, despite all those successes, nothing ever goes entirely smoothly in industrial relations. There have been some difficulties and differences between the Government and the Commission in recent times. Presumably that is the basis for this matter of public importance raised by the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;although he hardly referred to it. That difference between the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission stems essentially from two items: one is the national wage decision of April last year; the other is the salaries of members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that it is indeed unfortunate that we have had those differences. We have had a very harmonious relationship during the period until that time. I will just go quickly to the reason for those differences. The decision in April last year was a great disappointment to this Government, and I would have thought it was also a great disappointment to the Opposition. The Commission refused to move to a system of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time a case was being argued in which most of the unions, most of the employers, most of the States and the Federal Government all said to the Commission, `Let us move to a system of enterprise bargaining', and the Commission said no. That was a great disappointment to all the parties. Subsequent to that decision the Government indicated its disappointment with it. Some reasonably tough things were said, but basically the Government was expressing its disappointment about the Commission's not making a move which was generally seen as the right move to make. The fact that some of the Commission's language in its decision was derogatory to the parties did not help in the reception of its decision, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of last year we had a decision which brought in enterprise bargaining. In a sense, as far as we are concerned, that is behind us. We have now got that decision. We are moving to that system quite rapidly. The Government is pleased that that is happening. Obviously there was a problem which was referred to by Commissioner Turbet in his letter of resignation at about that time and obviously some continuing hurt has been felt by some members of the Commission about comments made at that time by the Government in relation to the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been the matter of salaries. This is an issue which, again, is an unfortunate one that has caused such angst. The House should be aware that this is not an issue of dispute between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition, through its spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong, has made clear that it supports the Government's approach to this issue, which has caused considerable antagonism with the Commission and led to some of the comments made by Commissioner Turbet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Commissioner Turbet said that he could not trust the Government, he was saying that he could not trust the Government because we would not accept the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, a decision which said that the old system of relativities should remain and that we should not change the nexus that existed for decades between the salaries of members of the Commission and the salaries of those in the Federal Court. That meant equality for the presidential members of the Commission and the judges of the Court, with the salary of the commissioners of the Industrial Relations Commission being 70 per cent of that of Federal Court judges. We said that that nexus should be broken, and we were supported by the Opposition. When Commissioner Turbet then criticised us and said that the Government could not be trusted to keep its word because we broke that nexus, the Opposition seized on that and said, `You cannot trust the Government'. But the Opposition supported our decision that brought down that criticism from Commissioner Turbet. What a ridiculous position those opposite are in on this issue!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the decision of the Government to break that nexus was an important one. That decision was taken quite consciously because we believed that it was inappropriate&mdash;at a time when wage and salary earners throughout this country had been through quite a number of years of very tight wages policy and a reduced level of real wages and at a time when we continued to be faced with a very tight wages policy&mdash;for the Remuneration Tribunal to decide in 1990 that there should be a 14 per cent increase in the incomes of the presidential members and commissioners of the Industrial Relations Commission. That was way out of kilter with what members of the work force were getting, the people whose wages are largely set by the members of the Commission. So the Commission would have been setting wages principles which gave wage and salary earners much less than 14 per cent, but would have been getting 14 per cent for its members. We believed that was quite inappropriate and that, therefore, in those circumstances we should change that nexus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set about doing that. It was a long and complicated process and I will not bore the House with the details. Essentially, it meant breaking the Remuneration Tribunal's original decision. Eventually, a committee of review&mdash;the Gleeson Committee&mdash;made recommendations about a new structure. We asked the Remuneration Tribunal to set salaries in accordance with that structure. It refused to do that and said that it wanted the old nexus back. So in those circumstances we felt that we had no alternative but to introduce a Bill into this House which would put in place what the new nexus should be. Essentially, it will give presidential members of the Commission 95 per cent of the salaries of Federal Court judges. It will also mean that in the current circumstances they will be getting a wage increase which is more or less equal to that of the rest of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is an entirely appropriate decision by this Government. It is not easy to break longstanding relationships of salary, but it has happened from time to time in various decisions of the Commission itself. The Commission has to accept that the Government has decided that that is the appropriate way for salaries to be restructured. This continuing hurt and agro that seems to be coming from some quarters of the Commission is really very unfortunate in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this has led to some changes in the Commission. There have been some resignations. We have seen the resignation of Deputy President Russell Peterson, who has gone to the New South Wales Industrial Commission, and now Commissioner Turbet has resigned. Those resignations are unfortunate and the Government regrets that they have occurred. But it in no way means that the Government feels in any way compelled to move away from the decision we made in relation to a proper salary structure for the members of the Commission who, after all, will still receive salaries, as presidential members, in the order of about $135,000&mdash;which is not too bad and is well above that which the vast majority of people in Australia can aspire to. Even the commissioners, who are on 70 per cent of that rate, will receive a quite substantial salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unfair for the Commission to imply&mdash;as it does through Commissioner Turbet's letter, if he is speaking on behalf of others&mdash;that it has been singled out in some way. The Government has rejected decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to a number of other areas&mdash;most particularly in the area of politicians' pay, where the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions have been rejected on several occasions. They have also been rejected in relation to other people, such as vice chancellors and some others who do not come to mind readily. There has certainly been no singling out of the Commission, to have commissioners' salaries rejected whilst others get the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions in full. That is not what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Commission has a continuing and important role to play in Australia's industrial relations system. It has been crucial to the implementation of the accord, for which I believe the Commission deserves considerable praise. It has made its independent decisions and it has seen that the approach through the accord between the Government and the ACTU is likely to bring about very sensible industrial relations outcomes. It has played a very substantial role in enabling those outcomes to be implemented. When it did not do that there were some difficulties between us, but we have now moved to enterprise bargaining, as not only the accord parties but also the employers and the Opposition want. So there is virtually a unanimity of view that that is the way things should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is ironic about Opposition members' comments on this MPI is that in trying to say that the Commission is being harshly dealt with by the Government, they are also in a position of wanting to do great damage to the Commission. Opposition members say that the Commission would continue to exist; but there would be no centralised wage increases, according to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), so those who would stay and try to hang onto award rates would not have much to hang onto, because they would never increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the policy announced by the Opposition shadow Minister, workers can get award rates only if both the employer and the employee agree; otherwise they have to enter into a voluntary agreement. If the Opposition gets into office, there will be very few people on award rates, the Commission will be of complete irrelevance, and far more damage will be done to people on award rates. These people will need defence against the Opposition more than they would ever need defence against any actions of this Government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the great observable facts about this Government is that the more extreme and the more strident its rhetoric, particularly from its leader, the further from reality we can assume the talk will be. For example, we constantly hear from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that it is time we were a more truly independent nation and that we must break away from our colonial past. The reality is that, just as long ago in the real world we stopped tugging the forelock to London, we now dance to the tune of the money markets, because during the Prime Minister's term as Treasurer we were driven so deep into international hock. Now he talks of greater independence, at precisely the same time as we slide into a situation in which the bankers tell us what we can and cannot do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government swears, hand on heart, that it is not out to destroy the integrity and independence of the Industrial Relations Commission, we again need to look very closely at the reality of what really is happening. The Government's actions, as opposed to its words, plainly reflect its determination to ensure that the IRC is a mere rubber stamp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gulf between rhetoric and reality extends to Labor's championing of the ordinary working men and women of this nation. Despite the Government's frequently repeated claims of dedication to the rights and dignity of those people it claims to have a monopoly on representing, the reality is that Labor remains patronising and authoritarian in its attitude towards the Australian people. Not for Government members a commitment towards the sort of workplace choice and freedom that ought to be part and parcel of a nation such as ours! The evidence abounds. Labor appears determined to keep its subjects well and truly under control. It will determine, so far as it is possible, what options are available to Australians in their workplaces and what options are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord process developed by our previous Prime Minister in the early 1980s was supposedly borne of a commitment to consensus&mdash;that was the buzz word we heard a lot of eight, nine and 10 years ago. Employees, unions, industrial tribunals, governments and employers were to negotiate outcomes and arrive at a consensus reflecting what was fair, achievable and appropriate. But, somewhat like the characters in Orwell's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Animal Farm</EMPHASIS>, some players soon found that they were not as equal as other players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the employers discovered that their interests were not always seen as terribly relevant. After all, they simply paid the wages. That was their role, often regardless of whether they really had the capacity to do so or whether it was in the nation's interest. Then some of the smaller unions around the place discovered that they were not particularly wanted either. To that, we can witness the 10,000 minimum membership rule and the whole push associated with that thrust of policy development. There was little concern for the rights of individual employees to either join a union or exercise what ought to be the democratic right not to join a union. The closed shop remains a feature in far too many Australian workplace situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the minimum membership rule, and with that the right to belong to the union of one's choice&mdash;if one wanted to belong&mdash;began to dissipate. The choices started to contract. Where is the freedom in that? Recently, as we have heard today, having dared to show a little independence some 12 months ago, the IRC, of all the players in the barnyard, found that it, too, was seen as less than equal in the new barnyard pecking order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord process is plainly not the animal that it once was. It is now about the political coordination of policy between Mr Kelty and the Prime Minister. There is not much respect for the Commission's independence there, as confirmed by its most recent and unhappy retiree and his recent and, I would have thought, very embarrassing comments on political interference and the domination of its role by both the Government and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While lip-service at least is paid by the Government of the need to devolve industrial relations, the reality is that the Government&mdash;or at least the Prime Minister and the ACTU's Mr Kelty&mdash;believes that it must maintain control. That is what it is all about&mdash;maintaining control. Even if there is to be enterprise bargaining, it must be monitored and controlled: do not trust the workers, they might not actually know what is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a refusal to make the up-front and very necessary changes to the legislation governing the Commission that would allow employers and employees to freely negotiate their own workplace agreements regardless of the desires of those participants at workplace level. The Labor movement, of course, is very keen to obscure the potential benefits to employees of effective and genuine enterprise bargaining. This is to the detriment of employees, productivity, our economic performance and, ultimately, as we are seeing only too clearly now, to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the Government clutching at every indication that things are turning the corner. Today it is inflation. As a farmer, somebody who is involved in a productive exercise&mdash;at least outside this place&mdash;I am very relieved to see that those inflation rates are down. But let us remember Max Walsh's comment to the effect that inflation is always down in a depression. They are his words, not mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The slide in our living standards is confirmed by OECD reports in recent weeks: burgeoning international debt and the tragedy that up to a third of our young people are not able to find jobs. There is a whole group of people out there who are becoming very dissatisfied with the sort of community that we have given them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of all this is that all these considerations are apparently deemed appropriate for the role of a mere back seat in the interests of retaining the position of both the Prime Minister and Mr Kelty. That concern is clearly reflected in the recent brawl over Troubleshooters and the upshot of all that mess. The campaign by the building unions to drive Troubleshooters out of the commercial and industrial sectors of the building industry had nothing to do with union membership because, after all, one cannot get a ticket on a building site without being a member and all its workers had union tickets; it was, in fact, about the right to work as independent contractors on commercial and industrial building sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the unions and for Labor relates not so much to pay levels&mdash;which are apparently quite satisfactory&mdash;or to membership, it appears to lie in the fact that those who work for themselves are a threat to unionism as it operates in Australia today, regardless of whether those people are in fact members of a union. They are hard to organise, after all; they are hard to control; they are capable of working harder and more effectively, and of doing so without regard for union directives. What is more, they might</PARA>
<PARA>expose the reality that subcontractors are often better paid in return for more efficient work practices&mdash;a vitally important principle and one that ought to be clearly established in Australia. It is interesting to note that the national social science survey indicated that 75 per cent of Australians now believe that remuneration ought be based on individual merit and those who work harder and better should be paid more than average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing that some of our more intransigent union leaders appear to want is for Australians to realise that freely negotiated contracts might well achieve better results for employees than unions in conjunction with the Industrial Relations Club, or what is left of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two things at the kernel of the debate on the MPI today: firstly, the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission; and, secondly, the future direction of industrial relations in this country. Let me first dispense with the question of the Commission's independence and the attack which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has launched today on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the composition of the IRC: there are 15 presidential members&mdash;five of them are from the union movement, precisely a third. That is roughly in keeping with the sort of distribution one would find in any industrial tribunal in State or Commonwealth jurisdictions. If we look at the commissioners, other than the presidential members, of which there are 30, we see that the number is larger. There are 13 union representatives amongst the commissioners, but there are 12 employer representatives; in other words, roughly even Steven. The reason for that has to do with the different nature and role of presidential members as distinct from commissioners in the IRC. It is a nonsense to peddle the sort of tripe which the Opposition has in recent days over this matter on the composition of the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that one of the things that was at the hub of this problem over the independence of the Commission was what happened to the pay of the industrial commissioners and the presidential members. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has already dealt with that matter. I would have thought that the honourable member for Bennelong would have had it clearly in mind, given the role which he has played in this place in debates affecting the remuneration of members of this House and senators where we have overturned decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal. He has played a key role in those decisions, overturning the Remuneration Tribunal's determination, with the support of both sides of the House, reducing the remuneration that would otherwise have been made available to members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an improper thing for the Parliament to enter that arena; indeed, the Constitution quite expressly provides that power to this place. Section 72(iii) makes clear the Parliament's authority to determine the remuneration of judges. It is absurd for anybody to suggest that it is not proper for this Parliament to determine the remuneration for members of the Industrial Relations Commission or other similar tribunals. To come into this place and suggest that, because the Parliament exercises that constitutional power it somehow limits the independence of the IRC, is patent nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where the real threat to that independence comes from. The honourable member for Bennelong raised this matter of public importance today. A couple of days ago he put out a press release, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties will not guarantee the security of tenure of future appointments by the Keating Government to the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an attack on the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission, what is? The honourable member has come out and baldly said in advance, `Don't worry about the independence of the Commission. We are going to look at anyone who gets appointed from today on and we might turf him out'. That is the position the honourable member for Bennelong has adopted in public; he is on the record as having said it. Now he turns around and says that because the Parliament exercises its constitutional authority concerning remuneration that the independence of the IRC is threatened. What patent nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has adopted this approach not just with the IRC. Some members might recall that, a few months ago when the Fightback package was released and various analyses were being done, in a doorstop interview the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was questioned about the role of some of the Treasury officials in analysing that package and the role of Tony Cole, the head of Treasury, was raised. On 26 November last year, in answer to one of the journalist's questions during the doorstop interview, the shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Mr Cole and other senior members of the public bureaucracy ought to take very careful note of what I say. Thanks very much.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not much doubt what he was talking about. If that is not an implied threat to the independence of the bureaucracy, the public sector, what is? Yet the honourable member for Bennelong has the gall and the hypocrisy to come in here and raise a matter of public importance built around a letter and a bit of media hype. It really is a sad case of selective morality on the part of the honourable member for Bennelong and those who are supporting the MPI. </PARA>

It is blatantly unfair that the procedures of the House are generally disregarded to our disadvantage in the rulings that you and the Speaker give from time to time in debate in this House.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is a very simple one. The fact is that the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) had informed you that I would be seeking the call. He did what you asked and what you subsequently said that he should have done. He simply went to you and said that I would be seeking the call. It certainly has standing when Mr Deputy Speaker himself said that, if that had been pursued, he would have adhered to that ruling. The blue business sheet has no standing. There is no priority here in the calling of the Clerk, particularly when we wanted to move before this Parliament at this time what is obviously going to be a major motion about the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and one of his Ministers. The very important motion that was to be put before this Parliament concerns the fact that the Prime Minister was unable to answer a question in Parliament today. He got completely flummoxed, panicked and ran out of here like Groucho Marx instead of staying and completing the processes of Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you were obviously aware that we were going to come back into the Parliament and demand that the Prime Minister return to this place to give a full account of the circumstances of that question and the issue at hand&mdash;the behaviour of one of his senior Cabinet Ministers and a matter of great impropriety. The procedures in the House are being abused by your ruling so as to prevent that debate. You are trying to call on the business of the Parliament so that we cannot proceed with the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is for that reason that I am moving dissent. It is indicative of what has become a trend in this place, to the total destruction virtually of the significance of this institution in the eyes of the Australian people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. In so doing, I want to point out the chronological sequence of the events which occurred here this afternoon, because they go to the core of parliamentary democracy. Not only are there the formal requirements of the House as expressed in the Standing Orders; there are also many conventions and courtesies which exist in real terms, which are all about giving people on both sides of the House a fair go. Mr Deputy Speaker, they relate specifically to your ruling this afternoon in calling on the Clerk at an inappropriate time, given all the circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I made my point of order in support of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Perhaps on reflection, Mr Deputy Speaker, you could have avoided this dissent motion by simply giving the call. You deliberately looked down at the time, which made it even worse. You looked down and called the Clerk in the knowledge clearly that you knew that the Leader of the Opposition was jumping up at that time. That is the order of batting. Honourable members need to understand exactly what happened; members of the public need to understand exactly what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) in the House came in and approached your chair in the time available&mdash;and it was a short time. He did not have to do that. But he did approach the chair and said to you that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking a call&mdash;and he need not have said any more than that. He advised you, as a matter of absolute courtesy only, that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call. I think I understand, from what the honourable member for Hume says, that he went on further to say that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking to move a motion. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Fife" NAMEID="CG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr Fife</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `seeking the call'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us keep it at that. That is exactly an extra courtesy which was being afforded by simply signifying that before the House. So you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were informed by a person whose advice you have every reason to respect. He has a particular function on the floor of the House which is denoted by the title of Manager of Opposition Business. You received that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, or shortly thereafter, the fourth speaker on a very important matter of public importance moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and seconded by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) came to the conclusion of his remarks. At that stage, as I said, you looked down and called the Clerk in the knowledge that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call. What we have is a double breach of convention, a double breach of procedure. It is one which I personally find very upsetting. The Opposition was of the view that you might make a much better Speaker than the current Speaker. But I know that I am not allowed to dwell on that path other than to say that this matter was put to you in a very fair way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, you then affirmed that chronology of events. After the honourable member for Hume and I took points of order you advised the House formally that you had been given notice prior to your calling the Clerk that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call. I repeat that: you affirmed to the House, as Deputy Speaker of the House in charge of business at the time in the House, that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call. A further, albeit short, period of time then elapsed before you in fact called the Clerk. Before you did that, the Leader of the Opposition was on his feet. Other members present will verify my eyesight from a couple of metres&mdash;it may not be the best eyesight&mdash;that the Leader of the Opposition was on his feet; he had given notice; and he was properly and legitimately seeking the call to raise an important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have failed in terms of this specific matter&mdash;the subject of this specific, very serious dissent motion. I think it is a good period of time since we have had a dissent motion in the House to a specific ruling. It is one that is not moved lightly. But you have gone too far. We gave you the chance to come back in the interests of the proceedings of this Parliament being kept on an even keel, in the interests of a fair go, and in the interests of merely some 45 minutes or whatever the other item on the blue business sheet might have taken. The item on the blue business sheet, of course, has a limited status before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to put in a second point, which I think is even more serious. We are talking about the Leader of the Opposition, not just a member of the House, seeking the call. Whilst all 148 of us would like to think in a sense that we are equals&mdash;we are certainly all members of this House of Representatives&mdash;there are procedures and longstanding conventions which say that, when the Leader of the Opposition seeks the call, he is given a measure of priority; he is given a measure of courtesy. That is laid down in various practices of the Parliament and, to a lesser extent, admittedly, in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on two counts, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have failed in that the ruling you gave was incorrect and is deserving of the dissent of the House. I appeal to the two Independents, who are not in the chamber at this time. This goes to the core of all that they would have us believe about their service in this House, championing the rights of parliamentary democracy and the rights of people to get a fair hearing. I ask them to come down into the House, listen to this debate and vote accordingly when we get to the voting stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, sir, have breached the courtesy extended to you; you really have. You confirmed to the House that the honourable member for Hume gave you notice with regard to the Leader of the Opposition jumping and, secondly, you have breached the convention associated with the proceedings of the Parliament in failing to give the call to the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I would make is a critical one. I have great respect for the Clerks at the table, and I do not involve them in the debate. To do so would be totally out of order. But I point out that the Clerks of the House are just that: they are the Clerks of the House. They do an enormous amount of work behind the scenes. They give good advice to both sides of the House. They have a proper and functioning role to continue in their work. But they do not take precedence over the Leader of the Opposition. They do not take precedence, for that matter, over the retiring honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott). They do not even take precedence over the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). Well might I choose those two members, because they have both had enough and they are jumping ship. They have announced that they are retiring from the Parliament, along with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I come back to the specific point that the Clerks have their ordained role. There is one fragile moment in the proceedings of the Parliament when in fact the Clerk has an even more elevated role, and that is during the election of the Speaker of the House at the start of each parliamentary term. But equally, I say to members of the House, and members of the gallery who witnessed this chronology of events, that the Clerks are just that&mdash;the Clerks of the House. They do not take precedence over the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I appeal to your sense of fair play and I appeal to the sense of fair play of members on both sides of the House and the Independents. On this occasion there is cause for us to give you the benefit of the time that has elapsed since you made this ruling. If you signify that you are prepared to reverse that ruling in the light of the information which has been presented, we equally would be prepared to withdraw the motion that is before the Chair. Events do happen quite quickly, and human error can occur. It is a genuine appeal, and the whole proceedings of the Parliament would be greatly helped if you took that course of action. I am an optimist; but let me say in black and white terms why, in the absence of that, every member in the House should, on this occasion, vote for this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the courtesies were observed. You, as Deputy Speaker, were advised that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call, and you have confirmed that on the floor of the House. It has been exposed. You have been caught red-handed. On the first count, all courtesies have been observed. Secondly, the absolute convention has been observed inasmuch as the Leader of the Opposition jumped, and jumped ahead of you as Deputy Speaker calling on the Clerk. That was clear cut and was observed by a number of people in this House. The Leader of the Opposition said, `Mr Deputy Speaker'. I concede that a short space of time was involved there. The third point I make is that no Clerk has precedence over any member of the House, and particularly over the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that you recognise the particular priority of the Leader of the Opposition, who sought to move that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) provide a full explanation to the House as to why he has failed to discipline the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) for a clear breach of his responsibilities to disclose his interests and to declare a relevant interest in matters decided by Cabinet. That is a truly relevant matter, given all the proceedings on the floor of the House this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I once again appeal to your good nature and to your past track record&mdash;perhaps not always perfect, nevertheless a track record on which we were prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt&mdash;to recommit this matter. It is within your jurisdiction and your capability, with the indulgence of the House, to recommit this matter in a way that would allow the Leader of the Opposition to proceed with his quite proper motion in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of that, for all the reasons that I have advanced I commend to all members of the House the motion constructively and carefully moved that this ruling be dissented from, because you have made a monumental error. You have confessed that error in as many words. You have much to answer for, and this ruling should be reversed. </PARA>

So I cheerfully withdraw to the shrinking violet. The fact of the matter is that the honourable member came into this place and spent a considerable amount of time disrupting the end of Question Time, which he referred to in terms of the chronology of the presentation of his argument, on the grounds that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had not asked that further questions be placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.

I am glad to see that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is cackling away, to acknowledge himself the ridiculousness of the point he made. The point that is at debate here is this: what is an appropriate order as far as the Speaker is concerned? The fact is that the House is totally within the control of the Speaker. The Speaker can choose to recognise whoever he cares to recognise. Speakers have had that right for hundreds of years and, in the case of this Parliament, for about 90 years. If the Speaker chooses not to recognise somebody on his feet but calls the Clerk to bring on business, that is too bad for the person concerned. That is all there is to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to add a few words to this debate because I think it needs to be understood that the dissent from your ruling revolves around a ruling made by one of your predecessors, Speaker Jenkins. It is important that the House understand that prior to Speaker Jenkins making that ruling it was possible for a motion to suspend Standing Orders to be moved at any time. Speaker Jenkins, on the other hand, decided that it would not be practical or desirable for Standing Orders to be suspended at any time. He determined that it should occur only in intervals between business, other than on matters pertaining to the business before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern about your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that you have put at risk that determination made by Speaker Jenkins. If it should be that you want to change that interpretation&mdash;and that, of course, is up to Mr Speaker's discretion&mdash;it might well be that the ruling you made was correct. But you have not indicated to this House that that is so. Let every member understand that the right to suspend Standing Orders is one that is exercisable by a member rising in his place only in an interval between business. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) rose in his place. It was not necessary but as a matter of courtesy the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) had given you notice. In this particular instance the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;notice having been given, albeit briefly&mdash;rose and, under Speaker Jenkins's ruling, it was imperative that the Leader of the Opposition be called or it would have been impossible for the proceedings of the House to proceed. That is the case under the interpretation that Speaker Jenkins gave to our Standing Orders for the practices required for a suspension of Standing Orders to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I put very strongly to you that it was obligatory for you to have called the Leader of the Opposition in a climate where the only procedure and practice available for a member of this House if he wishes to move a suspension of Standing Orders is for him to do so in an interval between business. That interval was there. You had not called the Clerk. With the Leader of the Opposition standing in his place it was obligatory for you to call him. If it should be as a result of this particular proceeding that the motion is lost, the result is going to be that you or Mr Speaker will have to make another interpretation on Speaker Jenkins's ruling, because it is a sacred right of this place that members have the opportunity to suspend Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there is an equal right of members of the House to negate that suspension. But we are not talking about the negative of the motion; we are talking about the opportunity to speak. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are the temporary custodian of the rights and privileges of every member of this House, and, as that custodian, you and you alone have the obligation to call any member, as a ruling of your predecessor says that it is the only opportunity for him to exercise that right. If you do not pursue that ruling, you are letting down the rights of every member of this chamber; you are denying members the opportunity to exercise the privilege that your predecessor said was theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you have a choice: either you accept that your ruling was wrong and you call the Leader of the Opposition or, if the view that you have asserted is correct, you must then change the interpretation of the Standing Orders that your predecessor has imposed. You cannot have it both ways. There has to be an opportunity for the suspension of Standing Orders. It is one of the sacred rights. It is written into Erskine May and it has been adopted in Pettifer's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, updated in its various forms. Whilst it is up to the Speaker to interpret how it may be exercised, it is up to the House finally to determine whether and in what way there might be an acceptance of that suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that, if you deny the Leader of the Opposition the call, you are going against the text and the intent of the ruling of Mr Speaker Jenkins in this place. That is not acceptable, because no member in this place can accept that you can impose your will in such a way as to deny a member on his feet, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, the right and the opportunity to be called. In that climate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe there is an obligation upon you to allow the Leader of the Opposition to speak and to permit him to move that suspension of Standing Orders. If you do not do so, I call on you to revise that interpretation of Mr Speaker Jenkins and to allow the Leader of the Opposition or any other member of this House to rise at any time to suspend Standing Orders so that that member can intrude on whatever business that particular suspension of Standing Orders might entail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you quite seriously that it is an alternative which you are now called upon to exercise. I put it to you that the result of the division, the equality of the voting, shows that there is considerable concern in this House and that you now have a greater obligation to give the Leader of the Opposition the call than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important issues. They are not matters, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you can just defer or matters on which you might think that some privilege or practice that you might like to impose can perhaps intrude. There is nothing more serious than the matter that the Leader of the Opposition wishes to raise&mdash;that is, the suspicion that a member has not complied with another standing order, that is, the disclosure of a personal as distinct from a public interest. If the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) failed to make those disclosures, he is transgressing in a way that is quite critical&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I raised it is that it goes back to the interpretation of the Standing Orders of this House. It goes back to a matter of a suggested breach of the Standing Orders, which enshrine in both Houses an obligation that if a member has a personal interest, as distinct from any other member of the community, he has an obligation to disclose. We have several standing orders which are really written into the Bible of this place, and that was what I understood the Leader of the Opposition sought to address by suspending Standing Orders. I put it to you that the ruling you made in preventing him from raising that matter is even more serious because of the nature and character of that breach. I seriously say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that unless you accept the right of the Leader of the Opposition to speak, we are all in a very difficult position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), I appeal to my two colleagues who are Independents to consider seriously the matters now before the chamber. They are matters that pertain to their rights as much as to those of anybody else. Should they wish to raise matters by way of motion now that there are two of them, I suggest to them that the decision now being taken by the Chair is one which affects their rights perhaps more than those of anybody else in this place. I suggest to them that it is very much in their interests. Presumably, if they meant those things that have been said, they are also matters which they would want to support in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important that you understand why this motion of dissent from your ruling has been moved. It is because you are denying individuals a right which is there through our Standing Orders, and I trust that you recognise the consequence if that ruling is not changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not hold the House for long. I suggest that this motion arises from a practice which has grown up in recent times in this House <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>of denying the Standing Orders and of manipulating them for the purposes of providing the media with their 6 o'clock news bulletins. The right to the call has never been an absolute right in this House, and it is not an absolute right. It is certain that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has privileges in the House which were largely developed during the time of Mr Speaker Snedden, I might say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that it was not an unusual practice when the Opposition was in government and when the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who has just spoken, was the Leader of the House for members to be denied the call when they were seeking it for the purposes of procedural or other motions. It is the choice of the Chair to determine the business of the House and to determine the manner in which it is conducted. There is some responsibility on the Chair to ensure that the House's business is conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that this is a serious motion. I believe that opportunities for the Leader of the Opposition to move such a motion do occur and are ample to provide him with the flexibility within his rights as a member. I doubt whether there have been more suspensions of Standing Orders in a short space of time than there have been during the period that the present Leader of the Opposition has been Leader of the Opposition. They are part of his normal debating procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a special occasion, as the right honourable member for New England would have us believe; it is part of the daily process of the Opposition in this Parliament, and it is planned and conducted in that way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very much so. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) will be pleased at any rate. On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO redevelopment, North Ryde, New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee involves the redevelopment of a site at North Ryde, New South Wales, for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A review of the North Ryde site was undertaken and a redevelopment strategy proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy involved the identification, staged development and release of certain lands for high technology business park purposes. The proceeds from the staged land release would be used to consolidate CSIRO's activities on the site and to upgrade and replace substandard facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main elements of the proposed strategy are a rationalisation and consolidation of CSIRO's accommodation at North Ryde;  the progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land in up to 11 indicative development lots to create a science and technology park;  the retention of principal CSIRO buildings in good condition to form the nucleus of the redevelopment in the divisional precincts;  the provision for all of CSIRO's anticipated accommodation needs for the foreseeable future in retained existing buildings, upgraded as necessary, and state of the art new buildings; provision of controlled access to the site to address urgent safety issues; an orderly, continuous redevelopment program anticipated to run for some nine years, but programmed to permit on-site research to proceed with little interruption;  and the whole redevelopment to be self-funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in September 1991. The Committee tabled its report on 31 March 1992, recommending the redevelopment at an outturn cost of $91.5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO has noted all of the Committee's recommendations and provides the following comments. Detailed plans for each aspect of the proposal will be provided prior to the commencement of construction and particular attention will be paid to energy efficiency. Discussions are continuing between CSIRO and the relevant State authorities about upgrading public transport facilities to the North Ryde site and, in respect of recommendations 7 to 11, which refer to the possible relocation of the food research laboratory to the Riverina region, the Director of the CSIRO Institute of Animal Production and Processing has commissioned a major review of directions for the CSIRO Division of Food Processing and related research areas in CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review committee will undertake visits to relevant laboratories and meet with interested parties in June, with its report being completed by the end of August. Its report will be considered by the CSIRO board shortly thereafter. The comments of the PWC about relocating the food research laboratory to the Riverina region have been noted by CSIRO and will be considered as an input to the divisional review process. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aspects of the motion which I wish to address concern recommendations 7 to 11 of the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works relating to the possible relocation of the food research laboratory and food processing division of the CSIRO from North Ryde to the Riverina region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was indicated when the Committee's report was presented to the House, I strongly support moving the food research and associated activities of the CSIRO to a rural area and preferably, as the Public Works Committee recommended, to the Riverina region of New South Wales. Accordingly, I am glad to see that, in light of the Committee's report and recommendations, the CSIRO has undertaken a major review of directions for the CSIRO division of food processing and related research areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the statement by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) that the CSIRO board will take into account the Public Works Committee's comments about relocating the food research laboratory to the Riverina when it is considering the final report arising from the current review. It is also entirely appropriate that as part of the review process the CSIRO representatives should meet with the interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I reiterate that I still hold the view that, as the Public Works Committee recommended, the Minister should do everything within his power to ensure that the relocation of the food research laboratory to the Riverina region is approved. Having regard to the Government's responsibilities, I consider that it is perfectly reasonable for the Minister to convey a view to the CSIRO board that, provided there are no significant financial or operational disadvantages to the CSIRO, it should relocate its food research laboratory in an appropriate rural area. If the Government does not make such an assessment and advise the CSIRO of its view, it must accept that it will be seen to be negligent in the discharge of its responsibility to the taxpayers. The Government should insist that the CSIRO take a national view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I  have no doubt that the best long term benefits for the CSIRO would be achieved by relocating the food processing division in the Riverina&mdash;preferably in the Wagga Wagga area where the Charles Sturt University Riverina campus is located. Many people and organisations in Wagga Wagga, Griffith and other parts of the Riverina have devoted a great deal of time and effort to making representations and submissions in support of moving this division of the CSIRO into the region. I hope their expectations will be fulfilled, not just out of sectional interest, but in the best interests of the CSIRO and rural Australia as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about this statement by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) and second the comments of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). The CSIRO has said that it will undertake an investigation into whether the research station should be shifted from Ryde. Along with the honourable member for Hume, I believe it should go to the Riverina, which is one of the major food baskets of Australia. On-line development can be done there and already a number of food processing operations are carried on in the Wagga Wagga, Griffith, Leeton and Narrandera areas. As the honourable member for Hume said, I think it is important not only for our region but also for Australia that the right decision be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of what I want to say has been covered, so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those people who have brought forward the possibility of this research centre being relocated in the Riverina&mdash;namely, the Riverina Development Board and, of course, the various shire and city councils in the area. I ask the Minister to take on board the words of the honourable member for Hume in requesting that this investigation be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Of course, the final decision lies with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works&mdash;and I see that the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), is in the House at the moment&mdash;on its decision on this matter and for coming into our region and bringing the motion into play. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith&mdash;That the Prime Minister provide a full explanation to the House as to why he has failed to discipline the Minister for Transport and Communications for a clear breach of his responsibilities as a Minister to disclose his personal interests.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of urgency that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) be brought back into this Parliament to give a full explanation of the activities of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) in relation to the performance of his duties as a Minister in light of evidence that has been released in the course of the last few days, mostly in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems, on the evidence to hand, that the Minister was the director of radio station 2HD in Newcastle&mdash;an interest which Ministers are required to declare and which he did not declare on his statement of members' interests. Therefore, this raises a host of questions as to the propriety of the Minister's behaviour, as on a number of occasions matters relating to radio stations were considered by Cabinet and by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, I refer to the question that I asked the Prime Minister in this Parliament today and the answer that he gave. This occurred shortly before, in response to the pressure arising from a second question and a potential third question, he ran out of this House&mdash;he did almost a Groucho Marx as he scurried out at a pace I have never seen before&mdash;rather than face the reality of further cross-examination on this matter. In those circumstances, I think it is absolutely essential that he be prepared to come back into this House and answer the questions that have been raised by the activities of the Minister for Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Prime Minister today what disciplinary action he was going to take against the Minister for Transport and Communications for not disclosing his company directorship in radio station 2HD in the Parliamentary Register of Members' Interests. I asked whether there had been a breach of propriety, and why he had not stood down Senator Richardson because of that impropriety. In his answer, the Prime Minister said that a number of honourable members had inadvertently left information off things&mdash;`things' is one of the words he uses all the time; the `thing' in question was the statement of members' interests. He went on to say that the register had periodically written to them and they had corrected it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Richardson wrote to me today saying that he apologised for failing to note his directorship of 2HD on his pecuniary interest form.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that Senator Richardson had gone on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to emphasise that the omission on my part was not motivated by any attempt to conceal knowledge from yourself or the Parliament. My directorship was well known by Cabinet colleagues, the party generally and was a matter of public record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of any circumstance when a conflict of interest may have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on to say that he accepted both the apology and the assurance. Following that, he tabled the letters and the other correspondence referred to. I think that was a deliberate attempt to divert attention from the full extent of the breach that appears to have occurred in relation to the activities of the Minister for Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correspondence focuses on his time since he became the Minister for Transport and Communications on 14 January this year and neglects the period when he was a Cabinet Minister prior to 14 January this year. Indeed, we can go back to 19 January 1988 when that Minister became a Cabinet Minister. But I believe he was a Minister throughout the whole period of the Hawke-Keating governments. In that capacity, he has a clear responsibility to lay down a statement of his particular financial interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of the purpose of the Parliamentary Register of Members' Interests. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the. . . Statement of Registrable Interests form is to place on the public record Members' interests which may conflict, or may be seen to conflict, with their public duty.</PARA>
<PARA>The document says that members are required to record the details of registered directorships of companies by indicating the name and activity of the company. Although senators are not formally required to meet the requirements of that register, Ministers are. Under `Directorships', the explanatory notes say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are reminded that they are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates (e.g. a family farm, business or investments), and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the Ministers' public duty.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that the purpose of the register is to avoid the possible conflict of interest between a Minister's private interests and his or her public duty as a Minister. That requirement exists for all Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport and Communications has been a Minister throughout the Hawke-Keating Government and a Cabinet Minister since 19 January 1988. He clearly has a responsibility under that register to declare all directorships. As we can see from the period in question&mdash;particularly from when he became a director of radio station 2HD on 21 September 1990&mdash;if we check his statement of registrable interests through that period after the appointment was made, he has not at any time declared that directorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the notes about the responsibilities of Ministers, they are required to resign directorships in companies. The Minister for Transport and Communications accepted one while he was a Cabinet Minister and failed to declare it. Subsequent to that date, there has been a number of major debates in the Parliament and in the Cabinet on matters that are of importance to a radio station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990 Cabinet agreed to draft a new Broadcasting Services Bill&mdash;I think that was a Cabinet submission introduced by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)&mdash;which proposed major deregulation of the radio industry, including liberalisation of ownership to allow for more than one radio station in one city. In March 1991 there were new foreign ownership limits in relation to radio and television stations. In July 1991 a new regional radio plan was discussed by Cabinet which was designed to simplify the licensing of regional radio and to allow supplementary licences so that a radio station could take another licence in the same area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) was appointed to the Ministry in July 1987 and to the Cabinet on 19 January 1988. The question that arises is: in the course of his being a Minister&mdash;that is, a Minister administering any portfolio&mdash;did he have commercial interests which, by a decision of the Government, would benefit him personally or his family? He is required, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) detailed, to set down quite clearly the level of interest that he has, or his family has, in the pecuniary interest form.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be family, because when we look at the detail from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, we see that 60 per cent of 2HD is owned by the ALP branch in New South Wales. On 21 September 1990, Graham Richardson became a director of this company. It was not as if he had been a director for a long time and on becoming communications Minister he just forgot to resign. It is much more than that. He actually became a director in September 1990. Today the Australian Securities Commission advises that he is still a director. When this matter was first raised yesterday in the Senate and the detail was provided by the Minister, he wrote a letter of apology to the Prime Minister relating some detail about his resignation, his arrival back in Australia and the six-day delay. That is a smokescreen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue that I come back to is: did he vote as a Minister, or was he involved in decisions of the Government, at any time that would have benefited him and the directorship of 2HD, which he represented? The key issue that I want to focus on is what is known as the Licence Fees Amendment Bill, which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, will well know, because he introduced it into this House. That Bill was the result of the 1991 Budget. That Budget reduced licence fees on radio by $8m across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I asked the Prime Minister: was there a benefit to radio station 2HD? Did Senator Richardson reveal his pecuniary interest in the matter during any Cabinet meetings or Budget discussions? This was a major and necessary concession to the radio industry, but it clearly benefited Senator Richardson and the company of which he was a director. Was he involved? That is the issue because, if he was involved, the benefits that flowed to 2HD flowed to him and flowed to the Labor Party, as owner of this station. That is the centre of the issue: there was $8m; how much flew across to 2HD? That is what we want to know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new permanent repository for Australian Archives, East Burwood, Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee involves the construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria. The proposed facility will provide up-to-date climate controlled, secure storage facilities for permanent value Commonwealth records. It will consist of three main elements, record storage, office accommodation and conservation. The office accommodation and conservation areas will be located in a two-storey configuration fronting a three-level record storage area. The building and site planning will also allow for future expansion of the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in December 1991. The Committee tabled its report on 31 March 1992, recommending construction at a cost of $6.5m at October 1991 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives and Australian Construction Services have noted all the Committee's recommendations and provide the following responses. The Committee felt that there may be insufficient car parking spaces if staffing levels at East Burwood were to increase in future. The staffing levels at East Burwood are based on maximum expected levels when fully operational in the future. However, the site has sufficient scope to expand car parking facilities to cater for additional vehicles should they be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee felt that Archives should proceed with the upgrading of all air-conditioning systems in existing purpose-built repositories. Archives will continue to upgrade all existing air-conditioning systems as part of its ongoing energy management program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the domestic hot water required at the proposed East Burwood facility be provided from solar hot water heaters. The domestic hot water supplied to the new facility will utilise solar energy through solar panels erected on the roof which will be assisted by a small gas booster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the building structure be designed to withstand the effects of an earthquake similar in magnitude to the 1990 Newcastle earthquake. The building structure is inherently suitable to resist earthquake loads and it is expected to survive an event comparable to the Newcastle earthquake with minor damage to cladding, partitions and services, but without any major damage to the structure. I thank the Committee for its report. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition parties do not oppose the motion to have this work done. I would like to make one very brief observation, one that I have made on some of the recommendations from the Committee in the past. While I understand the reason why the Committee recommends that the hot water service include solar panels, I would point out that, even at today's pricing, that is a more expensive option. I believe that it is an option that is not necessarily ruled out at the time of construction and may well be adopted at a later stage. I merely make that observation. I also add that, as this construction work is to be in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), I believe he has some very pertinent comments to make.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Federal member for Bruce, I welcome this motion that will result in the construction of the Australian Archives building in East Burwood. I should tell the House that this is a beautiful part of Melbourne. As one comes along the Burwood Highway heading out towards Ferntree Gully, Springvale Road turns to the right. This Archives construction will be in the middle of that huge block on the corner of Springvale Road and the Burwood Highway, which currently houses Radio Australia, a transmitting station of Aussat and, of course, the Tally Ho Technology Park. As one stands on the block and looks east, one looks out towards the beautiful Dandenong foothills. The city and the town at the bottom of the foothills is appropriately named Ferntree Gully because it is such a beautiful part of Melbourne. This building of two storeys which is to be built there will no doubt have beautiful views out along the Dandenong. I think those people who work there will have a most enjoyable workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) has said that there will be appropriate air-conditioning. I can assure the Minister that, at least for several months of the year, that is certainly needed there. I only wish that I had an appropriate level of air-conditioning in my electoral office, which is several miles down Springvale Road from where the Archives centre will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the economic merits might be of increased or decreased government spending, given an overall level of spending, the centre is to be welcomed because it will create some jobs in my area of Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Installation of fire sprinklers to the International Terminal Building, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>The international terminal at Kingsford-Smith was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Since that time the building has been modified in a number of areas to ensure that public safety is not compromised. Airport terminal buildings are not expressly covered by codes, but need to have appropriate protection. A number of reports have recommended the installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety to the occupants of the building, to protect property as well as other improvements, to provide smoke isolation, an emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation assumed control of Sydney Airport on 1 January 1988. Since that time additional fire exits have been constructed as part of improvements to the international terminal, which was completed in 1989 at a cost of $50m. Smoke isolation measures were also installed on existing stairwells and escalators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation later proceeded with further extensions to provide a new 70,000 square metre terminal and concourse at a cost of $272m. The design of the fire protection measures for the new terminal expansion was based on the assumption that the existing terminal building would have fire sprinklers installed. The works proposed at this time comprise installation of fire sprinklers throughout the existing building, associated building works, the replacement of plasterboard ceilings and ceiling tiles in the customs hall and departures area, and the treatment of asbestos from within the ceiling voids associated with the sprinkler installation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC board has approved funding of $14.6m as an outturn cost for the installation of fire sprinklers in the existing terminal building. It is proposed that these works will commence in June 1992 with completion within 2 1/2 years. In its report the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works agreed to the installation of fire sprinklers to the international terminal building at Kingsford-Smith Airport to meet the current fire safety standards, subject to the following recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation commission a fire safety study to determine whether cost savings can be made in the provision of fire sprinklers. The Federal Airports Corporation has accepted a proposal to undertake a fire safety study by the CSIRO Division of Building Construction and Engineering. This study will proceed without delay. May I say, as one who has visited that fire safety operation of CSIRO, that it is perhaps one of the best state-of-the-art operations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) direct the Federal Airports Corporation to complete an approved master plan for Sydney Airport as a matter of extreme urgency. A draft planning strategy for Sydney Airport was circulated for public comment in August 1990. This public review period closed on 13 November 1991. The FAC is about to commission the consultants SKP/Bechtel to finalise the Sydney Airport planning strategy, based on comments received, as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation thoroughly reassess all aspects of the outturn cost of $14.6m to determine areas of possible cost savings. On receipt of the findings of the CSIRO fire safety study, FAC will take all opportunities to minimise outturn costs. The Committee also recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation take all possible steps to minimise the need for the payment of disability allowances, and advise it on the extent of any such payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC will undertake the timing and staging of the works so as to restrict the extent of any disability allowance and will seek advice from tenants as to the extent of any such payments made. I would like to thank the Committee for its support on this particular motion and the others that have come through to us today, and I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While not opposing this motion, I would like to emphasise a couple of the points that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has drawn to the attention of the Government. I believe these are quite serious, and that the Government ought to be making sure that some action is taken. The first one is the Committee's recommendation that the Federal Airports Corporation commission a fire safety study to determine whether cost savings can be made in the provision of the fire sprinklers. I will come back to this point in a moment. While the Government has said that this has been accepted by the FAC,  the fact remains that the Committee has drawn attention to it as a point of concern and obviously has strong reasons for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the Committee again talks about a master plan as a matter of extreme urgency. This has been raised before. Despite that, there are still some delays, and clearly it is a matter of great concern. If we do not have a master plan, money could be wasted because it might be directed into areas that are not a matter of priority or are not a matter of long term need. It is a matter of grave concern that it has had to be raised yet again. I commend the Committee for having the courage to state that it is a matter of extreme urgency. It does place pressure on the Government, and on the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) in particular, to do a little bit more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again the Committee has come back to the point about cost savings. It is very important that this matter be raised, and the fact that the Committee has alluded to it means that the Committee itself is of the opinion that there probably are cost savings to be made. The onus is now on the Federal Airports Corporation, through pressure from the Government, to actually achieve those savings. I would hope that when the project is complete we will be able to hear about how those savings have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I would like to come back to is the Committee's recommendation that the FAC take all possible steps to minimise the need for payment of disability allowances and to advise it of the extent of any such payments. I think that is another very important point, because questions arise as to who will pay the disability allowances. Is it going to be the users or is it going to be the FAC? Again, the fact that the Committee has alluded to this indicates that it could be potentially quite a serious problem. I believe it behoves the Government to ensure that such a problem does not arise before rather than after the event, when it is too late. With those comments I would like to again support the Public Works Committee in its efforts. As I say, the coalition does not oppose this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Asian Development Fund Bill 1992 is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $350m towards the fifth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. The ADF is the concessional lending arm of the Asian Development Bank. Its resources are directed towards the poorest countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It is important that we contribute to and work towards improving the standard of living of these economies, because not only is it compassionate and sensible to do so, but also, of course, as the economies of these nations and their political and economic stability improve, Australia will become a recipient of bilateral trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asia-Pacific region as a trading region is expanding dramatically for Australia. I think the region accounts for something like 70 per cent of our trade; it is certainly worth something like $19.1 billion, $7.5 billion of which is a surplus in our favour. That is growing at something like 8 per cent per annum. I think that is very exciting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunities that will come through as consumer demand grows and standards of living improve in these nations can never be underestimated. Australia has been a member of the ADF since it was established in 1974 and has participated in the four previous replenishments. The Asian Development Fund Act 1974 authorised Australia's contribution to the establishment of the fund. Further contributions were authorised under the Asian Development Fund Acts of 1976, 1978, 1982 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian contribution of $350m amounts to about 6.5 per cent of the total fifth replenishment value of about $US4.2 billion. The main principle of payment arrangements is that contributions should be paid in instalments in such a manner that at least one payment is made in each of the four calendar years covered by the fifth replenishment, that is, 1992 to 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the financial impact, in accordance with Australian practice, payment will be made in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes which are expected to be encashed over a period of nine years beginning in 1992-93. Funds required for 1992-93 will be provided within the global development assistance allocation. Funds for future years will be found within the global development assistance forward estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that banks can be particularly effective in many areas. In particular, they can encourage macro-economic reform in developing countries, as I said, with the stabilisation of monetary and fiscal policies, flexible exchange rates and debt reduction and management. They can also implement development cooperation activities on a scale that is not possible for Australia as a single donor, particularly for poor groups in countries which fall outside the regional focus of Australia's bilateral aid. Banks can also be particularly effective in stimulating policy reform, for example, with regard to specific cross-cutting issues such as the environment and women in development. They can develop better policy environments by, for example, reforming institutional frameworks and including transparency in policies. Banks can also undertake research functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment is a very important issue with regard to developing countries. One of the things that always concern me is that some multinational companies see an advantage in setting up in Third World countries because the infrastructure costs are much less and because there is not, in many instances, a requirement for the level of pollution controls that we expect and that are accepted in Australia and, indeed, in most of the developed world. Because these countries are keen to have industry, they have in the past in some instances accepted lower standards for themselves to see those jobs and industrial growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always believed that the environment is a global issue. There are people who, while they may be dedicated to the environment in this country and want to stop development here, shut their eyes to development in Third World countries that are actually polluting the environment. Either we have to work, through frameworks such as this Bill recognises, to improve their level of education and understanding so that they ensure that decent pollution controls are in place or we have to develop those industries here under our control so that we can ensure that the global issues of pollution are managed in a sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some countries in South East Asia that are cutting down massive areas of rainforest for industrial development and also for agriculture&mdash;some of which is necessary. But it is interesting to note that often the people who criticise us when we cut down a tree in Australia do not level the same amount of criticism at these countries. Those problems can be resolved only by creating a better economic environment in Third World countries, a better understanding and better cross-referencing of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government directly focuses about 70 per cent of its aid on the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Government recognises that some of the world's poorest people live in the countries where we do not have bilateral development cooperation programs. Providing aid to these countries, whether directly or indirectly, helps meet our objective of being a good international citizen. I think that is important. We can be proud of the role we play in many areas&mdash;Cambodia is one that comes to mind&mdash;certainly ever since the United Nations was formed, and Australia played a leading role, we have been at the forefront in trying to make it a better world. As I said, this Bill contributes in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The multilateral development banks represent a means for Australia to channel funds into the poorest countries, whose populations are mostly in Asia. Other organisations which have a global mandate also focus aid in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I would like to touch on briefly, because time is short, is that of using letters of credit. Australia could stop using promissory notes and use letters of credit, as do some other countries, but there is a problem with this. To make a change to letters of credit would result in Australia having to make payments for existing commitments and the new commitments at the same time. This would substantially increase the share of the development cooperation budget going to the MDBs in the short term and place severe pressure on the bilateral component of the aid program. I think we can justifiably say that the present system of using promissory notes makes sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier in this speech, I think that Australia has a massive role to play in the Asia-Pacific region. We can be proud of the role we are playing. It will need to be increased. I am pleased that the Opposition is supporting this Bill; that is important. Where it is possible for both the Government and the Opposition to be in tune, it is an advantage on the international stage because other countries look at us and take cognisance of what we say. I think we can be very proud of what we have done. Because time is short, I will close on that note. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), because, as he pointed out, the purpose of the Asian Development Fund Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $350m towards the fifth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, in presenting the second reading speech, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) presented background information on the Asian Development Bank and the role it plays as a major international development agency. He noted in that speech that the Asian Development Fund was established in 1974 and that its parent body is the Asian Development Bank. That bank, of course, was established in 1966 with the principal objective of encouraging economic growth and development in Asia and the Far East, including the South Pacific. The Asian Development Bank is a multinational one in character with 47 member states, the majority being from the Asia-Pacific region. It promotes investment of public and private capital for development purposes; provides loans for the encouragement of growth; coordinates the economic and development plans and policies of its member states; provides technical assistance in support of important development projects and programs; and cooperates with relevant United Nations agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Macarthur pointed out, the Asian Development Fund is the concessional arm of the Asian Development Bank and about one-third of the bank's lending is on concessional terms. The contributions to the fund are one of the largest single items in Australia's official overseas development commitment. Australia has been and remains a strong and active supporter of the bank. I believe it is generally acknowledged that the bank is highly regarded in the international capital markets for its responsible and rigorous operational practices in increasingly complex and demanding circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its establishment, the bank has lent about $33 billion for well over a thousand projects. The bulk of this lending has gone into mainstream economic development projects and programs. But in looking at the history of the bank, it is interesting to note the change that has occurred over 26 years in the relative importance of sectoral lending. For example, in the 1960s the major sectors were ranked in the order of transport and communications, finance, agriculture, industry and mining, energy, and social infrastructure. By the late 1980s and early 1990s that order had become agriculture, energy, transport and communications, social infrastructure, finance, and industry and mining. In short, agriculture, energy and social infrastructure have gained in relative importance, while finance, transport and communications, and industry and mining have fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism over recent years of multilateral development banks generally, including the Asian Development Bank, about what might be called their project lending philosophy. It is possible that the bank's altered lending patterns referred to above reflect some success in moving the bank away from an emphasis on lending targets and towards such policy reform areas as structural and social adjustment and, more recently, towards environmentally aware projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of that criticism, it is surprising to me that the bank has not responded more aggressively with evaluation material to support the benefits which come from its lending strategy. For example, the bank does comment in its annual reports on what it calls its post-evaluation policies, but there is surprisingly little information given. What is reported gives the reader the impression that that evaluation is more in terms of whether the project is judged to be a success or failure in terms of its direct benefits. What I would look for, particularly in relation to infrastructure and structural adjustment projects, is not only an assessment of their immediate success and benefit but also a careful analysis of their success within the broader arena of structural adjustment compliance and an assessment of their effectiveness in terms of the bank's broad policy framework. Perhaps this is simply a matter of editorial policy in the bank's annual reports. If this is the case, it is a policy I believe to be regretted, for it is a practice which leaves the reader with a concern that projects which offer immediate, identifiable and apparently significant benefits at the project level might be given some preference over other projects which have less identifiable immediate benefits but offer important increments within a given structural adjustment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that the bank has done considerable work in this area of evaluation, but if it has it is not being properly reflected in its published material. In fact, I believe some concern must be felt that the bank's 1990 annual report not only reported very briefly on its post-evaluation work but gave much of that space to the fact that resource considerations had forced it to alter its policy from one of evaluating all projects and programs to one of selective evaluation. I think there must be some sympathy for the pressures which forced such a decision, but the matter of real moment is that those scarce resources be applied in the most effective manner within a clearly structured policy program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, I believe, growing tension among both donors and borrowers as to the most appropriate lending policies for multilateral development banks. I have seen published reports that the World Bank is suffering a decline in its success rate. Clearly, this is also a factor which must be given careful attention by the Asian Development Bank. In its latest annual report it admitted that only eight, or 30 per cent, of the 27 projects evaluated in 1990 were considered to be successful. The bank correctly acknowledges that one of the disadvantages of selective evaluation is that it tends to direct resources towards those projects which appear to have problems. However, it also acknowledges that its long term overall success rate is only 63 per cent, a figure which suggests that far greater attention needs to be given to research, policy conditionality and project management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the implications of what I am saying could be better understood if I were to point out that what we really face is a situation not only where $37 of every $100 loaned by the bank is unsuccessful by its own criteria, but also where some of the bank's critics would question both the appropriateness of that criterion and its associated policy framework. Some donor countries are clearly concerned about the value which recipient countries are receiving from each loan dollar, and there is some evidence of a growing momentum in favour of change. The strength and direction of that change is for the bank's board to assess, but it seems evident that there will be increasing demands from major donor countries for loans to be conditional on borrowing countries accepting policy reforms and for more evidence that funds are being used effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters which I would expect the bank to be addressing in a highly professional way. Its lending philosophies have been and are being questioned and its policy strategies and effectiveness are in need of careful scrutiny. I believe we are heading into an increasingly complex and uncertain time and this, together with expected fiscal constraints throughout the 1990s, points to a need for the Asian Development Bank to show a responsible and responsive attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur has referred to policy guidelines recently set by the bank, including a focus on poverty alleviation, the role of women, cooperation with non-government organisations, the environment and the development of the private sector. These are sometimes referred to as social sector and cross-cutting programs. It should be noted that their place within the bank's policy framework is not yet agreed on and is still the cause of considerable debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur also suggested that the bank became increasingly concerned in the 1980s about the impact of development projects on the environment. A policy framework has now been established, we are told, which incorporates environmental considerations into every project. That may well be the case, but I can find little in the bank's published material which indicates that it has a sufficient appreciation of the critical and urgent interrelationship between development and the environment and the importance of this for many donor countries. For example, in its latest annual report it offers an administrative note that its environment division has been upgraded to the Office of the Environment, but there is little else by way of comment on environment related content within its project and program lending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Macarthur is correct in saying that the bank is genuinely concerned about environmental matters, it must be assumed that the sensitive nature of environmental guidelines for some borrowers is encouraging the bank to under-report both its efforts and achievements in this field. The bank will be well aware, I am sure, that the development-environment relationship is a matter of importance to Australia as well as to a number of other major donor countries. This subject will inevitably become a matter for increased and urgent attention by the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some grounds for concern about the bank's response to these considerable and admittedly complex pressures but, as I have suggested above, there is some feeling that the bank is not identifying and adjusting quickly enough to the rapidly changing economic and geopolitical circumstances of the 1990s, that its loan quality is not receiving sufficient attention and that its project orientation and lending criteria are no longer totally appropriate to today's circumstances. At the bank's 1986 annual general meeting, Australia's then Acting Treasurer, Chris Hurford, commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that the bank should not sacrifice the quality of its loan projects in order to achieve lending targets is one which we support. Bad projects benefit neither the bank nor the developing countries concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we relate that comment back to the matters that I have already stressed&mdash;the low rate of success of projects, the reduction in evaluation auditing, the slowness of policy reforms and an undue cautiousness in handling environmental considerations&mdash;then we see that the bank has reached a point where a major review of its objectives and operations may be needed. Here I readily admit to a sympathy for the bank at this time of very rapid and complex change. But in such circumstances the obvious need is urgent and effective dialogue to establish agreed policy strategies and lending priorities. What many of us want, in short, is evidence of a commitment to the inevitable process of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can take the House back to 1982, we will recall that the bank's replenishment target for the years 1979 to 1982 was $US2.15 billion and that Australia contributed $A97m or 5.14 per cent of that target. In negotiating for the next period, from 1983 to 1986, the bank recommended the target of $US4.1 billion, a figure which would have maintained its annual lending growth at about 17.5 per cent. Australia supported that target, but international support was not forthcoming and the target was reduced to $US3.2 billion. At this level the bank was able to maintain its lending in real terms, but without any growth. To meet that target, and to give tangible evidence of its support for the bank, Australia was obliged to increase its share to about 7.2 per cent. Negotiations over the next replenishment period, from 1987 to 1990, began in 1985, with Australia among a small group of countries which agreed on a $US4 billion replenishment target in order to maintain real lending levels but again with no provision for growth. In this case, the final agreed target was reduced to $3.6 billion and Australia's pledge of $A410m increased its contribution to a 7.98 per cent share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we debate the present replenishment, Australia now finds itself in the position of being the fifth largest donor overall and the second largest in this region after Japan. But to maintain the existing share contribution of 7.98 per cent, Australia would have to provide $A431m. In fact, as the honourable member for Macarthur has already pointed out, our contribution is to be $A350m, a share of only 6.5 per cent. That, of course, is a very substantial reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, no doubt you will recall that the honourable member for Macarthur referred to the increasingly satisfactory performance of the bank, but reflected on Australia's need to consider its capacity to contribute to future loan commitments. Specifically, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the reduction from our last share was necessitated by our difficult economic and budgetary situation, and our wish to maintain flexibility in the aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA>That latter remark is directed to the current fiscal constraints and a wish to place a greater emphasis on bilateral aid assistance. Of course, the Opposition has some sympathy for this and honourable members will be aware that the Fightback package commits the coalition to an overall reduction in the aid vote, but with increased emphasis on, and attention to, bilateral commitments to improve delivery, greater priority to our regional interests and greater opportunities for Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear is that just as a number of donor countries have previously constrained their contributions to the bank, Australia now finds itself in circumstances where it has similar constraints. Realistically it seems to me to be unlikely that the Asian Development Bank will operate through the 1990s with other than, at best, a maintenance of its lending programs in real terms, and I would be surprised if it achieved that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank must be well aware of these influences and I would expect it to respond accordingly. I believe it has played an important role in fostering economical and social development in the region of immediate interest to Australia and, as I have pointed out, we have given it very considerable support. While Australia will continue to play its part as a significant member of the bank, global, economic and geopolitical circumstances suggest that the bank must now review its present strategies and policies if it is to meet the needs of members into the next century. </PARA>

A $350m contribution represents an appropriate balance that will enable Australia to continue to play a significant role in the Asian Development Bank while, importantly, allowing financial flexibility in the rest of the development cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Australia's contribution is lower than that committed to the fifth replenishment, explanation of that reduction was given to participating members of the fund. Australia's contribution, accounting for about 6.5 per cent of the total replenishment, is still higher than the 6.1 per cent average of Australia's previous contribution to the ADF, and we remain, as other speakers have pointed out, the second largest regional donor in the fund, after Japan. This move to limit the growth of share of ADF in the overall development cooperation budget reflects the need to maintain flexibility, as I mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the role of the Asian Development Bank, a major international development agency owned by the governments of 36 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 16 countries from Europe and North America, it is worth while making reference to the agreement establishing the bank. That agreement, which forms part of the Asian Development Bank Act, expressed the view of the contracting parties at the time in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the importance of closer economic cooperation as a means for achieving the most efficient utilisation of resources and for accelerating the economic development of Asia and the Far East;</PARA>

<PARA>and, further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognising the desirability of promoting the harmonious growth of the economies of the region and the expansion of external trade of the member countries.</PARA>
<PARA>The passage of time since that agreement was forged in 1966 has not altered the basic charter of the bank. In 26 years of operations the bank has become a major catalyst in promoting development of the most populous and fast growing region in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank's principal functions include, firstly, to make loans and equity investments in the economic and social advancement of developing member countries; secondly, to provide technical assistance for the preparation and execution of development projects and programs and advisory services; thirdly, to promote investment of public and private capital for development purposes; and, finally, to respond to requests for assistance in coordinating policies and plans of the member countries. In its operations the bank is also required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or less developed countries and to give priority to regional, subregional and national projects, together with programs which will contribute to the harmonisation of economic growth in the region as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, energy, capital market development, transport and communications, and social infrastructure. Most bank financing is designed to support specific projects; however, the bank also provides program sector and multiprogram loans. The bank actively pursues cofinancing activities with official as well as commercial and credit sources. The bank has also entered into equity operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the history of the Asian Development Bank, it is clear that the bank has played a significant role in the development of the Asia-Pacific region. Up until last year the bank has committed about $37.8 billion in loans and investments for over 1,100 projects. The bank's cumulative commitments have amounted to $655m for about 79 projects. Technical assistance in grants and loans has amounted to $2.7 billion. Cofinancing, which has become an integral part of the bank's operations, has amounted to $10.8 billion, out of which official sources have contributed $7.5 billion and commercial sources have contributed the balance of some $3.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank also has a fine record with sectoral activities. It has financed about 159 irrigation and area development projects, benefiting 28.3 million people; 82 fisheries, livestock and forestry projects; 99 projects for industrial crops, agro-industry and support services; and eight fertiliser projects. In the important area of energy, 178 projects, including 152 power projects, have been funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of transport and communications the following projects have been funded: 46 projects in the ports and shipping sector for the construction, rehabilitation, modernisation and expansion of port facilities; 81 projects for the rehabilitation, maintenance and construction of primary, secondary and feeder roads; seven railway projects to increase freight capacity by about 70 million tonnes; and 14 telecommunication projects to improve and extend services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as social infrastructure is concerned, funding is being made available for the installation of water supply and sanitation projects, benefiting more than 85 million people throughout the region. Funding is also being made available for 51 education projects involving the establishment, as well as the rehabilitation and expansion, of primary, secondary and tertiary education and training institutions, together with a variety of urban infrastructure facilities. Of course, not all projects have been successful. However, with the careful monitoring of the projects and programs, the success rate continues to improve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension I was indicating the enormous contribution that Australia makes to this region as far as aid is concerned. I indicated that Australia focuses some 70 per cent of its aid in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Government recognises that some of the world's poorest people live in the countries where we do not have bilateral development cooperation programs. Providing aid to these countries whether directly or indirectly helps to meet our objective of being what can be referred to as a good international citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The multilateral development banks represent a means for Australia to channel funds into the poorest countries whose populations are mostly in Asia. Other organisations which have a global mandate also focus aid in the Asia-Pacific region. The ADF focuses most of its lending on the poorest countries. As mentioned in the second reading speech, about 60 per cent of ADF funds are committed to projects in the Bangladesh and Pakistan areas where the average per capita income was $US180 and $US360, respectively, in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our aid enables us to contribute to areas and in ways that we could not as a bilateral donor; for instance, policy dialogue in Papua New Guinea. Maintaining a share to the MDBs at about 12 to 14 per cent would still enable generous bilateral programs to be maintained with countries in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has strongly encouraged the ADB to: firstly, give more attention to activities in the South Pacific area, for example, prepare economic reports for a number of individual island economies; secondly, continue concessional lending to PNG, most recently at 3.19 per cent of the ADB commitments in 1991, which is up from some 1.3 per cent in 1990; thirdly, expand the activities of its South Pacific regional office in Vanuatu&mdash;in April 1991 additional ADB responsibilities were transferred to that region; fourthly, to support efforts by the region to help itself and set its own agenda. In other words, this Bill reinforces the Asia-Pacific focus squarely and unequivocally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks today by making reference to some specific areas within the region. I will refer to India and China first. I understand that access to ADB for both India and China was supported by all donor countries, with the exception of the United States. Australia argued against separate treatment for India and China both being eligible under ADB criteria for ADF funding and noted that Australia would consider additional funding over the course of ADF6 if India-China access was accepted. Once again, this was rejected by the United States, and access to both India and China was denied. India and China continue to have access to the ADB loans on non-concessional terms&mdash;a position that I trust will be reversed in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning finally to Papua New Guinea, Australia supports the lead agency role of the ADB in Papua New Guinea. However, in the agricultural, transport and health sectors some concern must be expressed that the banks have not given sufficient attention to sector development projects which would require the ADB to take a more active and substantial role in both program design and monitoring performance. It is important that we look at collaborating more closely with the ADB and these sectors in sector studies and co-financing programs and projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the shortcomings and flaws that have been shown to exist in the implementation of the projects and programs funded by the ADB in Papua New Guinea, it is imperative that ADB activities continue in our nearest neighbour both to complement and support our bilateral aid to that country. As we continue to see the increasing importance of the development of our region and acknowledge the critical role played by the Asian Development Bank and its Asian Development Fund, it is timely that the Government sees fit to make a significant contribution to the sixth replenishment not only to confirm our support for the poorest developing countries in the region but also, most importantly, to allow the necessary programs to be implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my comments today on what is being said about the Asian Development Bank, which I recall I last spoke about in this House some 20 years ago, in August 1972. The Bill we have before us is to authorise a contribution by Australia of some $A350m towards the fifth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund, ADF6. This Bill, together with previous commitments to the international financial institutions, will add to the already substantial proportion of the global aid program committed to the international financial institutions in the years 1992-93 onwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian Development Fund is the concessional lending arm of the Asian Development Bank which was established in 1974. It should be emphasised that the ADB provides roughly one-third of its loans on concessional terms. It is worth recalling that the basic role of international development banks is to supplement and add to the flow of aid going to developing countries from government sources. The banks have available to them large amounts of capital from donor governments which is not paid in but callable and thus serves as a guarantee for the borrowing activities on the capital markets of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a point that is not often understood. The banks then re-lend the amounts that they have borrowed to the developing countries at relatively low rates of interest. The developing countries themselves either do not have access to these markets or else would have to pay far higher rates of interest; this is known as a soft loan. International development banks thus add substantially to the amounts of capital available to the poorer countries of the world for development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB was established in 1966 with the principal objective of encouraging economic growth and development in Asia. The ADB promotes investment in the Asian regions of public and private capital for development purposes. It provides loans for the encouragement of growth, coordinates the economic development plans and policies of its member states and provides technical assistance to help prepare, finance and implement development projects and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is owned by the governments of 36 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 16 countries from Europe and North America. Its resources are mainly directed towards the poorest countries of the Asia-Pacific region. It is the only regional development bank to which Australia belongs and as such is a symbol of our commitment to the Asia-Pacific region and an expression of our desire and ability to be a good neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a member of ADF since its establishment and has participated in the four previous replenishments. As with the World Bank, Australia has been a strong and consistent supporter of the ADB and ADF. Our Asian Development Fund Act 1974 authorises Australia's contributions to the establishment of the fund, and further contributions were authorised under the ADB Fund Acts of 1976, 1978, 1982 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between ADF3 of 1979-82 and ADF4 of 1983-86, Australia increased its share of ADF funding from 5.14 per cent to 7.10 per cent, or by approximately 40 per cent. This enlarged contribution was initiated by the coalition Government under Malcolm Fraser and continued under the current Labor Government. This change was a reflection of our growing interest in the Asia-Pacific region not only in terms of development assistance but also in terms of foreign policy and trade perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is currently the second largest regional donor to the ADF after Japan, and is the fourth largest overall. Australia's share of ADF6 is, in fact&mdash;and this should be noted&mdash;lower than its share of ADF5. It is fair to say that this reflects our large existing commitments to the World Bank and our current economic circumstances and prospects. I shall not take the time of the House to discuss this part of my speech further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the inception of ADF our share of funds has, however, averaged around 6.1 per cent. As a major shareholder and contributor to the bank, therefore, Australia plays a significant role in formulating the bank's policies. All Australian Governments must remain vigilant to see that Australians occupy significant positions in the bank's staffing arrangements and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the intervening 20 years since I last spoke on  similar legislation in this House, I have visited the Asian Development Bank as I have had close friends who have worked there. It certainly is a very specialised expert group of people who work for ADB. I believe the great trauma is that, despite our large contributions, our staffing positions are nowhere near as senior as they should be. I think that I heard one of my colleagues, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), say earlier that this was because Treasury men were running it. A close friend of mine who was there as a director was in fact a trade department man. So it has not always been Treasury, even if that is the case now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have to be more serious about seeing that Australians have positions of control and authority within the bank. What is not realised anywhere near enough is the degree to which expert consultancies are used by ADB. This is an area where we must continue to see that Australian consultancy firms&mdash;particularly in the engineering field&mdash;are utilised. It may sound simple but it is something that has to be constantly looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to both the Minister in charge of this Bill and his advisers that this is something that has to be examined closely. Far too often we see some of the larger countries taking over as if they half own it. I will not name the nations I have in mind, but they are there and have to be watched. We have to see that we promote Australians to these positions. It is not just a case of getting chaps senior jobs; it is a matter of ensuring that Australian experts are used as experts for the developing countries in Asia. Far too often this is ignored. As I said earlier, I say again to the appropriate people: do something about it. Do not sit back and let the other countries take over, which I suspect they have done. That was certainly happening some few years ago and I strongly suspect that it is still happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with Australia's overall policy standards, ADB is being encouraged to pay greater attention to issues such as the alleviation of poverty rather than having an all-out focus on economic growth. Far from being concerned only with international finance and capital markets, the bank has developed a good reputation in assisting small scale enterprises by local populations. It now systematically looks at the alleviation of poverty as one of its main objectives in framing its strategies to assist development in member countries. Australia also encourages the bank to look at more lending for infrastructure projects, including primary education and health. This trend away from traditional infrastructure projects is similar to the pattern found in the World Bank's policy, and has to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second objective of the bank's policy formulation is the role of women in development. For example, the ADF supports a program in Bangladesh known as the rural women employment creation project. This aims to assist women in rural areas by facilitating their access to credit and generally raising their awareness levels about what sort of assistance is available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important consideration and relatively recent development in bank policy which Australia, together with other donor countries, has encouraged is the consideration of any negative environmental consequences that the bank might unwittingly promote through the use of its funds. Goodness knows where it is putting some of its funds for the development of the southern Asian region. Very strong environmental considerations need to be brought to bear in this area. However, it has started and one must be pleased about that. For example, for projects that have a significant impact on the environment the ADB releases environmental impact assessment statements at least four months before the project goes to the executive board for consideration. It is in this particular role that we should be seeing Australians coming to the fore, especially with the history and record of Australian consultants in this area as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), mentioned, Australia has consistently supported the incorporation of India and China within the aid framework of the ADF. However, I understand that no consensus was reached at the last set of negotiations on the ADF and so these funds remain inaccessible to China and India. Australia will continue to lobby for the incorporation of these two countries to access ADF funding, but not at the expense of the smaller traditional recipients on a bipartisan basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which Australia has consistently sought to promote within the auspices of the ADF has been the continued high level of assistance to smaller Pacific Island countries and Papua New Guinea. It is probably worth reminding the House once again that, although Papua New Guinea is now a member of the ADB in its own right, at the time of its accession to the bank Australia agreed to stand behind Papua New Guinea's obligations until such a time that it was able to take over its own responsibilities. It is perhaps appropriate that I should mention this as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently visited Papua New Guinea, where he had some interesting things to say about economic development in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB is now taking a leading role in Papua New Guinea in agricultural, road, port and health projects. The promotion of business and economic cooperation at a regional level is one area in which the ADB has played a significant and beneficial role for Australia. I believe that these links are indispensable in promoting a greater sense of community among the nations of the region, and have assisted Australia to come to terms with itself as a fully-fledged partner within the Asia-Pacific group of nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes within the region and the domestic situations of certain member nations of the ADF are perhaps worth mentioning at this point. While Australia has had constraints due to domestic budgetary pressures to take into account, other players in the field have, in contrast, markedly improved their own economic situations. We will inevitably see a movement away from the traditional spheres of influence such as the United States of America, and a move towards a greater influence by the Asian nations themselves with regard to the direction of policy formulation within the ADB. I am thinking particularly of Taiwan and Japan. A recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not surprisingly in a world hungry for investment capital, Taiwan's cash hoard is attracting overseas suitors and multiplying Taipei's opportunities for dollar diplomacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Asian Development Bank successfully raised $100 million in Taipei&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, $US100m&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as part of a $300 million dragon bond issue. Says the Bank's Treasurer Tomoo Hayakawa: `For the past 25 years our major capital markets were Tokyo, New York, London, Frankfurt and Zurich'. But now this is where the money is.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, it is in Taipei. I think that this should be taken into account by all Australian politicians and Australian advisers. The significance of Taipei must not be understated as far as Australia is concerned. If we are going to play a part in this neck of the woods, the rim of the Pacific, we have to be much more realistic about our associations and relationships with Taipei. It is good to know that we now have an air service going between the two places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also remind honourable members that Japan has a substantial economic and trading relationship with countries of the Asia-Pacific. In 1990, 32 per cent of Japan's exports were destined for the United States; 14 per cent to the newly industrialised economies, such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore; 7 per cent to other ASEAN countries; 2 per cent to China; and 2 per cent to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, 23 per cent of Japan's imports were sourced from the US, 7 per cent from the NEIS, 10 per cent from the rest of ASEAN, and 5 per cent each from China and Australia. That takes care of half of Japan's imports. Japan's direct investment in Asia&mdash;approximately $US7 billion in 1990&mdash;has been necessary for the continued development of regional countries. These statistics, therefore, are obvious indicators of Japan's crucial economic importance to the region. It is not just a case of buying properties on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Asian nations have been critical of Japan for focussing on Japanese interests and seeing them only in terms of markets, low cost labour and an abundance of natural resources. The belief is widely held that Japan has been unwilling to transfer technology and management skills as part of its investment. I come back yet again to the need to ensure that Australian expertise in the field of consultancy is pushed very strongly. I cannot feel more strongly about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this Japanese investment is substantial and important is illustrated by figures for investment in the ASEAN countries. Figures published recently by the Asian Development Bank indicate that Japanese investment constitutes 45 per cent of foreign investment in Thailand, 27 per cent in Malaysia, 20 per cent in the Philippines, and 16 per cent in Indonesia&mdash;making it the largest investor in all four of these countries which are vital to Australia. These are indeed sobering figures. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 13 April it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developing Asia will continue to be the fastest growing region in the world, underlining its importance as an investment and export market for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be that for a few years, most of the economic dynamism in the world will be concentrated in developing countries in Asia and the Middle East, and to some extent in Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA>Greg Earl's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Malaysia is projected to be the region's growth leader with an 8.5% increase in gross domestic product which is down slightly on the past two years but may pose inflation and current account problems. The region's other growth leaders will be Thailand with an 8.5% increase, China with 7.8%, Taiwan 7.5% and South Korea with 7.3%.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the good figures for inflation which came out today, it is interesting to see where Australia stands when compared with those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I have just mentioned should be extremely significant for Australians&mdash;governments, traders, tourist industry folk and members of this Parliament&mdash;for we must realise that our future depends on the success of the ADB region to overcome poverty, protect its environment and keep up with tourist development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB is a sound institution to help achieve these goals and I strongly support the Bill, with the regret that bad local circumstances in Australia have meant a lower contribution this time around. I wish the ADB great success. It has a history of strong expert knowledge and dedicated people have worked for it. My great regret is that there has not been a greater contribution by Australian citizens in Manila where it is based. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join in this debate on the Asian Development Fund Bill because I think it is important legislation. It relates to the role that we as a country can play in helping other nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back only seven or eight days to an occasion in my office in Rockhampton. I received a phone call from one of my constituents from the central highlands. This person was quite irate to start with. He was very upset and concerned generally about a decision he had just heard of that the Australian Government was going to assist Vietnam with a contribution of $100m in aid. He said&mdash;and I had heard it many times before&mdash;that charity begins at home. This brought back to me something of the division that exists in the attitudes across this country as to what role we ought to play when it comes to assisting developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be associated with this legislation. Whilst the previous speakers have pointed out that our contribution this time around will fall to $350m from some $430m, it is still a significant contribution and it will be money well spent. It is being spent through an organisation which has proved itself to be a very efficient and effective vehicle for delivering developmental assistance to the poorest developing nations in our own region and throughout South East Asia and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to tell the story and explain it to Australian people because, like my constituent who said that charity begins at home and expressed concern about the money that we were giving by way of aid to Vietnam, there are hundreds of thousands of other Australians who do not understand why we, as a country of only 17 million people, are playing our role in helping other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those at one end who say that we, as part of the Western developed world, have a moral obligation to help those countries who are in difficulty: those who are disadvantaged and those who are developing. There are others who say, `Look, let's not give away everything we've got; there's got to be a balance'. I think that is the position that most Australians take. It is certainly the position I take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take a very parochial position. I believe the aid we give ought to go, in the main, to our region. I know that we ought to take an international position, in that we need to accept that there are countries throughout the planet which are in difficulty. But I think we need to say that we can do more and we can be more effective if our assistance goes to the local region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I strongly support the Asian Development Fund. I know that the Asian Development Fund has contributors from all around the world&mdash;they come from Austria, Italy, Germany and so on. Some 52 nations are members of the Asian Development Bank and they contribute to its lending arm, the Asian Development Fund. I know that they are not being parochial in their attitude when they also contribute considerable moneys&mdash;in fact, millions of dollars&mdash;to the South East Asian area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think it is proper that that is where we target. I think there is much to be gained as we increase our aid in this area. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who said not so long ago that we are locked into a course. In fact, I was given a copy of his speech. He made the comment that we were on this course and that there was no turning back. He was talking about our move to Asia. He was not suggesting that we throw off our culture and our heritage to break away from or cast aside what we are; he was simply saying that we must adopt a new direction. I think this has been happening, it is just that the Prime Minister is giving a higher priority and greater importance to it. It is proper that he does so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to maintain our cultural independence, but we need to broaden our understanding of those around us. Often a myopic view&mdash;a very narrow view and a blind position&mdash;is taken by people who have never left their home towns. I say that, in reality, there are people in this country who have never gone more than 20 or 30 kilometres from the place where they were born. They do not understand that the world is a big place and that we have world responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is changing. In 1990, some 50,000 Australia students were studying Japanese. In two years, that has grown to 100,000 students studying Japanese. There is also a growing awareness economically. We have 120 Australian companies which are now heavily involved in Indonesia. Australian companies are playing a role in the coalmining and goldmining industries which make us the dominant nation as foreign investors in that country. We see that our role in the Philippines, in Papua New Guinea, in Indonesia particularly, and throughout the Asian areas is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I had the privilege of going to the Chinese Embassy for dinner. I was quite surprised when the Ambassador explained in some detail the growth in our trade with China.

I think he sums up what we have to be about and explains why we need to be part of the Asian Development Bank and support the concessional funding that comes from the Asian Development Fund. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a time of great opportunity for Australia. It is a time when Australians have a chance to grasp the prosperity, self-confidence and independence in an interdependent world that earlier Australians in expansive times had hoped for their country. . . The North-East Asian economies are more closely complementary to Australia in their resource endowments and in the commodity composition of their trade than any other economies on earth. . . In economic terms, Australia's horizons are being widened rapidly by the sustained growth close to our northern shores, of economies that need, uniquely, the goods and services that we have the chance to produce well, and that possess resources that we need most for our development.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums up the reality, as Malcolm Fraser would have put it so long ago: the reality is that Australia will gain enormously by building those bridges and establishing our credibility and bona fides with our neighbours to the north. It is vitally important that we do not just talk about these things but are in there doing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We gain greatly, because as we give moneys through the Development Bank&mdash;and those moneys are lent in concessional loans to the many different developing nations for the some 63 different projects that are being pursued at the moment&mdash;it is our industry and our entrepreneurs that are able to provide products and services. There is an economic gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge those Australians who have concerns about the amount of money we give in overseas aid to understand that ultimately we are the beneficiaries. The world benefits most in that we have a better and a healthier world and we start redressing the sorts of poverty that exist. Poverty reduction has to be placed on the top of the agenda in this world of ours. But we gain not just in moral and human terms, but also in economic terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago I had the privilege of being part of a delegation to Indonesia. Whilst we were there, we were talking to some very senior Ministers, as well as the President of Indonesia, and it was pointed out to us in a number of discussions that in that year the Japanese had given $2,000m in aid to Indonesia. That is an enormous amount of money. It is well known that the Japanese have a policy that they go in with their aid and follow with their trade. That is not a bad cliche to run, in some ways. We can gain from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come a long way from the days when Bill Hayden was foreign Minister. When we took over Government in 1983, I think the trade-aid link was only about 25 or 30 per cent. In those days, the trade-aid link with the USA, Russia and Japan was something like 70 per cent. We have now lifted that, and we are gaining enormously as we go into these countries with our aid support. We also gain significantly when, through a vehicle such as the Asian Development Bank, we are willing to give some $350m to ensure that this money goes to upgrade and enhance the quality of life of the people who live there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that there are some 1.7 billion people in this economic zone. It is a zone in which productivity has been growing above world levels and world averages. It is a zone in which it is all happening, and in which there is an excitement. Those who have had the privilege to visit will understand what I say. It is no wonder that the Western world is pouring so much money into this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the ADF lent $1.35 billion. Fortunately for us, some 5 per cent, or $70m, of that went into the Pacific area. We must gain, because it supplements what we ourselves are doing. It means that those around us are gaining: they are having infrastructure built&mdash;be it in health, education or in general areas of industry. That improves their quality of life, their purchasing power and, ultimately, their demand for products that we produce. This is the point Ross Garnaut has made: we are well-placed geographically and we are well-placed in resource terms to meet the needs of those nations around us. Therefore, it is important that we establish our bona fides well and that we do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some figures for the last financial year as to what we are contributing in terms of aid. The USA provided 21 per cent of all the money under this scheme. Japan contributed an enormous 35 per cent. We are only a small nation, yet we contributed 6 per cent. I think that is quite significant. I accept that it is down from the previous 7.13 per cent figure, but this $350m will be a major part of the financial resources that these nations need to draw upon to build up their infrastructure to become developed nations rather than developing nations. It is so important that we play our role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note from the figures in material that the Parliamentary Library gave me and that the Minister assisted me with that since the development fund began in 1974, the South Pacific region, our nearest neighbour in those terms and the region which we have a special link with, has received $413m in assistance. We must remember that this is money given interest free with only a one per cent service charge. I think that is considerable. That has meant enormous advantages and leaps forward for our own region. When we add to that the assistance that has now gone to PNG, the Philippines, Indonesia and to those in our near north, we see that our region is benefiting. </PARA>

It is because of that $1.3 billion that has been poured in there over these many years that Asia, South East Asia and the north-east Asian areas are booming in economic terms. Even if it sounds like a broken record, we need to tell those doubters over and over again, `Yes, we understand why we need to give special preference to our own in this country, but we also need to take a worldwide point of view and, more importantly, we need to take a regional point of view'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the bank itself has changed its environmental unit into a full time office. I note that there are more environmental assessments and impact studies now being carried out. It is because Australia is playing its part in saying to these nations, `We want you to develop. We want you to produce. But you must also preserve for the future, and that means preserving your environment'. It is being achieved because Australia, as a contributor, is able to encourage those nations around us to recognise their environmental responsibilities. </PARA>

That is how we achieve political stability in our region&mdash;not by huge armies, not by the might and force of some nation, but by the friendship, trust, cooperation and partnership that is the product of this sort of involvement, an involvement through a joint bank that takes up the causes of those who are the needy, not the greedy. </PARA>

That is what this Bill is about; it is about giving $350m that belongs to the people of Australia to other people. But we are giving it because we know their need is very important.

However, to begin, can I say that I find the whole nature and character of debate in this Parliament something that increasingly concerns me.</PARA></TALK.START>

We pretend that this House in some way has some influence on Government policy. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who has the prime say in the field, is of course in another place.

I think it is a pity, because this is an area of prime responsibility at a time of economic malaise in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our Fightback program we have committed ourselves to reducing our expenditure in the foreign aid field. We have done it on the basis of the best figures that are available to us. The best figures at the moment are provided in what is called the `Green Book'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an expenditure which is going to allow the Asian Development Bank to provide its allocation of funds, as I understand it, to its lending authority over the period from 1992 to 1995.

Let us have a look at our multilateral aid programs. Honourable members will be interested to know just how many there are. Under the heading `International financial institutions' the Australian Government advanced funds of $70m in 1991 to the Asian Development Fund and this year the estimate is nearly $50m; the International Development Association last year was advanced $108.5m and this year the estimate is $109.5m; and the International Fund for Agriculture Development was advanced $2.5m and this year the estimate is $2.8m. In other words, the Asian Development Fund received $70m last year. Presumably, there is a forward commitment, but there is nothing in the second reading speech which allows us to see, other than from the estimate of $49.9m, whether, as I would presume, some part of the funds which are allocated in this Bill will be added to them.

The second reading speech of the representative Minister does not tell us any of the detail. The statistics in the `Green Book' show that we are apparently going to have $49.9m, but nothing tells us how much is really going to be provided and whether that $49.9m has taken into account the additional allocation or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the multilateral aid programs, we see 10 under the `United Nations' title. We then have a general item `Commonwealth Organisations'. The total for the United Nations is $72.5m. Let us put that in perspective: the Asian Development Fund is one of a group of international financial institutions which are allocated $162.2m. There are 10 instrumentalities under the United Nations, and the total is about half of that at $72.5m. I do not know what `Commonwealth Organisations' includes, because we are not given the benefit of any explanation. They are allocated $12.2m. Then we have four `International Research, Environment and Development Organisations', which receive nearly $20m, or $19.6m. Of the total estimate of $1,313.9m for this current year, $266.5m will be allocated to international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that Australia is extraordinarily generous. The speaker who preceded me, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), told us how much money had been spent in Indonesia. Australia has been a very generous contributor to international aid projects over the years. Frankly, whether it is the Asian Development Bank or any of these other funds, I am a bit sceptical about whether we have really received our value for the dollar. There are two bases for saying that: one is this pretty bland statement about success rates of ADB loans, and the other is that we do not really get our fair return in terms of the way in which the ADB fund or any of these other financial institution funds are allocated. Sure, we have a representative on the board and we have a governor, and we participate in all those funds, but things are pretty crook in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether many people in the electorate of Wills really feel that the employment rate is particularly satisfactory. They are not unique. We could go around Australia at the moment and look at some of the areas where the Victorian Labor Government decided it was going to spend money. Its success rate was probably about the same as that of the ADB. The State Bank of South Australia has not been too hot with its record of successful loans, either. And we could go to Western Australia and look at its record of preferred loans. Are we really getting value for the taxpayers' money in allocating so much to these Development Bank funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the record of our bilateral programs. My trouble is that we seem to be always giving with very little return. Sure, we are now contributing a lot more in our region, and I think that is good, but unfortunately in this latest `Green Book' the statistics do not go very far back. They do give us a record of expenditure from 1987-88 to 1991-92 estimates. There is little doubt that we are now spending a big percentage of our aid programs in Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific and South East Asia, and I think that is good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that we are, however, still maintaining programs in Africa and we are maintaining a number of these international aid programs that make me wonder what we get out of them. I am all in favour of helping women, but we provide a considerable grant to the United Nations Development Fund for Women. We provide a considerable grant of money to the United Nations environment program and the United Nations fund for population activities. We provide significant funds to a range of things such as academic research seminar support. I can tell honourable members that there are a few people around the place who would love to go on academic research seminar support. I do not know quite what it means. We have a range of programs that are too vague, too imprecise, with a success rate that is not sufficiently identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to provide money, as we have, of this order, we really deserve a little more analysis from the Government of what percentage of the ADB's funds is spent on administration. There is none of that here. We like to think that the aid we contribute is actually going to help people, but the Minister representing the Minister representing the Minister has not really told us what percentage of this $350m that we are spending is providing the administrative staff. I will always remember the period when I was President of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations some years ago. I was horrified to learn that approximately 40 per cent of the FAO staff is permanently based in Rome. I am not too sure what the ADB's record is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the second biggest regional contributor, and the ADB is a very important agency as far as Australia is concerned. It is a pretty appalling effort by the Government to produce a bland statement saying, `We are going to give you this money', without identifying what proportion of the money is going to administration and to what degree something serious will be done about evaluating the success of these projects and making sure that these rather obtuse comments about the partial success of loans that have been made to date are going to be improved for the future. </PARA>

A lot of our multilateral programs are in areas where they could properly be given more serious review.

I think they are too top-heavy by far in administrative support. The assessment of individual projects seems to me to be based more on a product of a heart on the sleeve attitude than on a hard economic approach.

In the context of an Australian aid budget that has been declining in real terms, the Government has sought to limit Australia's contribution to 6.5 per cent of the total of the fifth replenishment of the fund. This means that Australia will remain the second largest donor in the region to the fund, after Japan, and the fourth largest donor overall. However, it also means that an increasing proportion of Australia's official development assistance will be channelled through multilateral development banks at the expense of direct bilateral assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), the share of the overseas aid program going to international financial institutions could rise by over 18 per cent by 1994-95, compared with a share of around 8 per cent in the mid-1980s. Contributions to the ADF are one of the single largest items in Australia's foreign aid program. This is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs, as the Government appears to have acknowledged in the Parliamentary Secretary's second reading speech. However, having acknowledged the problem, the Government has not acted upon it by slashing Australia's contribution to the ADF or to any of other international financial institutions to which we regularly contribute. The reason for this is fairly clear. The Government does not want to compromise Australia's position of influence within the Asian Development Bank, which is considerably greater than the almost non-existent role that we play in other international financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Australia's contribution to, and participation in, the ADB is not worth while and should be scaled down accordingly. I would like to do this by challenging some of the more absurd claims made by the Parliamentary Secretary in his second reading speech about the Asian Development Fund. The Parliamentary Secretary began with the claim that `participation in the ADF has been an efficient means of achieving aid delivery to the poorest countries of the Asia-Pacific region' and that the ADB complements our bilateral aid in the South Pacific. I think it is now well established that the most efficient way of delivering aid, whether comprised of official or unofficial funds, is through many of the non-government organisations, the NGOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next most efficient means of foreign aid delivery is bilateral aid, although there are a host of difficulties with such official development assistance, which I will come to later. But by far the least efficient means of foreign aid delivery is through multilateral development banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a number of criticisms of foreign aid delivered in this way. It should be noted, however, that many of these criticisms are equally applicable to bilateral development assistance at a government to government level. What makes bilateral aid preferable to multilateral aid is that Australia exercises a greater degree of control over these funds. Moreover, such bilateral aid is not consumed by the bloated bureaucracies of the multilateral development banks that seem too often to put their own interests ahead of those of aid recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I hope to make apparent, these banks become ends in themselves and Australia has been caught in this trap in its agreement to such a large contribution to the latest replenishment. If Australia is to have a foreign aid budget, it should be channelled through NGOs to the greatest extent possible. Domestically, we have come to realise that the provision of welfare, whether funded by government or privately, is usually best done through private sector voluntary agencies. We need to come to the same realisation in the case of official foreign development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, through the Parliamentary Secretary, claims that the ADB `has become a major catalyst in promoting the development of the most populous and fast growing region in the world today', thereby implying that the massive economic growth in our region is attributable in some measure to the ADB. A moment's reflection should make it readily apparent that the massive economic growth in our region is due principally to private domestic capital formation and foreign direct investment from private sector sources. The significance of this is that it is frequently argued that foreign aid is essential to capital formation which, in turn, is essential to wealth creation. In fact, capital formation is the result of economic growth, not its precursor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic development of the West was not underpinned by foreign aid, nor has the bulk of the economic development in our region owed itself to foreign aid. In fact, Asian-Pacific governments and businesses can readily borrow funds, both domestically and internationally, from private sector sources, assuming always that the projects for which they are seeking support are productive and the country concerned does not have an overly restricted foreign investment regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution of the concessional finance that is disbursed by the ADF to the economic development of our region is thus limited to the savings made by borrowing from the ADF, rather than from private sector sources, with the difference being paid for by Western taxpayers. The contribution of such foreign aid to economic development is therefore minimal. Moreover, it may well be that these savings do not offset the costs involved by some of this capital being lost to the bureaucracies involved in administering the donor's aid program, as well as by the recipient government's administrative excesses. Many, even most, of the recipient governments to which we dispense foreign aid in this way are notorious for the misallocation of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that we are about to face a world capital shortage which will make the development task of developing countries more difficult. But, at the same time, Western governments preside over the misallocation of billions of dollars annually to multilateral development banks and bilateral aid programs forcing up the cost of private capital to developing countries. Any benefits arising from the concessional lending of bodies, such as ADF, are largely illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private investors in developing countries pay for such concessional lending through higher borrowing costs, and Western taxpayers foot the bill for concessional lending by Western governments and multilateral agencies. The net effect is a transfer of wealth from Western taxpayers to aid bureaucracies in recipient and donor countries, as well as bureaucracies of the international financial institutions. The ADB is no exception to these bureaucratic excesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to an article written for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Triple A</EMPHASIS> magazine a few years ago, `The lifestyle for ADB staff is good; they are seen locally as the fat cats, earning tax-free salaries in US dollars, driving smart cars&mdash;the bank has more than 300 Mercedes&mdash;which are out of the car park by 5 p.m'. The article quotes another observer as saying, `The ADB offers a nice life for people who are not necessarily geniuses'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Creating more powerful governments and aid bureaucracies is the end result of foreign aid, with the possible exception of those official funds channelled through NGOs. Needless to say, many of these recipient governments follow policies entirely antithetical to economic development. While in the Western world we are attempting to dispense with the dead hand of government in our lives, in the case of the developing world we are actively promoting it. An excellent example of this is found in the case of the ADB's grants to the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year the ADB approved a technical assistance grant of $600,000 to the People's Republic of China to `strengthen the State Planning Commission' of that country. According to the bank, `The main objective of the technical assistance is to strengthen the institutional capabilities of the State Planning Commission in indirect management of the national economy, through macro-economic planning, coordination, supervision and regulation'. So much for promoting the free market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was only one of a number of ADB grants to foreign states regulatory authorities in the centrally planned economies of China, Laos and Vietnam over the past 12 months or so. How the strengthening of state regulatory authorities in centrally planned economies is designed to foster economic development in the Asia-Pacific region escapes me entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary noted that `development of the private sector is also a major policy aim of the bank and the ADF'. This is now a common line spun by international financial institutions, by which they pay lip-service to the market, but with little of the substance in terms of their lending practices. Again, there is a double standard in comparison with our own practices domestically. In Australia, government support of the private sector is known as `picking winners' and is rightly frowned upon, yet we actively promote this same process in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were really interested in the development of the private sector in developing countries, we would facilitate its access to foreign direct investment from private sources by having the ADB and other international financial institutions pull out of international capital markets. If anything, concessional lending by the ADB encourages the recipient countries to maintain restrictive foreign investment regimes so that their governments can maintain control of the bulk of the foreign investment activities in their countries and obtain investment on concessional terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is being said that the shortage of capital is the main justification for foreign aid, yet this very aid helps to ensure these capital shortages. Peter Bauer, a leading critic of foreign aid, has rightly observed: `It diminishes the people of the Third World to suggest that, although they crave for material progress, unlike the West they cannot achieve it without external subsidies'. It does diminish those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a major goal of the ADF is poverty alleviation rather than economic development as such. This is a worthy goal, but the ADF pursues it in a counterproductive way. The first thing to note is that ADF lending is aimed at the poorest countries. Generally speaking, only countries with a GNP per capita under $US860 are eligible for ADF funds. In this way, lending by the likes of the ADF and the International Development Agency actually serves to reward poverty in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADF assistance to governments in developing countries ignores the fact that it is often those very same governments that are responsible for the impoverished state of their people. While lending to NGOs is an effective way of bypassing the destructive policies of these governments, lending to the governments themselves is effectively a pat on the back for their policies and may even assist them in pursuing those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to conceive how official development assistance can help alleviate poverty in countries with governments that systematically impoverish their people in the quest for political and economic control. These governments also often maintain large military establishments, further underlining their own lack of commitment to poverty alleviation. Official development assistance should follow political and economic liberalisation rather than precede it, if it is to have any hope of achieving meaningful poverty alleviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of eastern Europe, Western governments have mostly ensured that foreign aid has followed rather than preceded economic and political liberalisation, although even here it could be said that we have been too forthcoming, which is one of the main criticisms that has been made of the ADB's cousin, the European Bank For Reconstruction and Development. But in the case of both the IDA and the ADF, only the weakest and most inconsequential reforms are required to secure access to funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the ADF6 negotiations, Australia argued for Vietnam and China to be given access to ADF funds. It would be difficult to argue that either of those countries is sufficiently committed to economic and political liberalisation to justify the resumption of ADF assistance. Fortunately, a consensus could not be reached on admitting China, and Vietnam is still excluded from receiving funds. It would appear that one of the motivations behind granting access to China and India is the need to find new recipients of ADF funds. Economic growth in the region has been so strong that there is a decreasing demand for ADF funds generally, and project lending in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the ADF continues to expand its lending activities, at the expense of the quality of its lending program. Indeed, the ADB has gone so far as to consider granting full membership to the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other Commonwealth of Independent States members in central Asia, on the grounds of some weak link to the Asia-Pacific region, and despite the fact that these countries will be eligible for EBRD lending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank needs to move towards providing assistance for the development of regional capital markets and providing governments with advice on such issues as privatisation and deregulation rather than continuing with the expansion of unnecessary project lending. Such moves are being resisted by the management of the bank, since a new focus for its activities would require new skills, which would in turn require staff changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in the quality of ADF lending has led to accusations of project assessments being falsified by ADB staff to show returns where none in fact exist. The Parliamentary Secretary put forward two particularly silly arguments in favour of our continuing subvention of the ADF. The first is that, `As a major shareholder of the bank, Australia plays a significant role in formulating the bank's policies'. It is true that Australia plays a far more prominent role in the ADF than in other multilateral development banks where the same argument is used, but with very little truth. It should be obvious that the argument is an entirely circular one. It is silly to argue that we should contribute to the bank because this then allows us to play a greater role in the bank&mdash;one naturally follows from the other. Playing a role in the bank is entirely incidental to the issue of whether and to what extent we should be contributing funds at all, which is surely the more important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this way that the ADB and bodies like it become ends in themselves rather than the means to achieve what should be the carefully considered goal of maximising the value of our foreign aid expenditures. It is pointless boasting about our role in the ADB if that institution is a fundamentally inferior way of delivering aid. To quote Peter Bauer once again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign aid consists of inter-governmental wealth transfers. To describe these transfers as development aid disarms criticism, obscures issues and prejudges results. It has helped bring about an axiomatic support for this policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The other particularly silly argument put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary was that `the ADB provides a significant source of procurement for Australian business'. Australian goods and services bought with our official development assistance funds are simply given away by the Australian Government, and constitute a transfer from Australian taxpayers to the Australian businesses which benefit from this procurement. We are hardly better off as a result of that process. In fact, we are worse off to the extent that not all foreign aid is returned to Australia in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary is really saying that we should be grateful for any of the funds that come back our way, even if they do go towards lining the pockets of select Australian businesses in a rather arbitrary way. Any benefits Australian business may derive from our foreign aid program are purely incidental to the question of whether such assistance should be provided at all, and ignores the costs involved in providing such assistance which, by definition, must outweigh any such incidental benefits. With such a high and increasing proportion of Australia's official development assistance being chewed up by the multilateral development banks, Australia should conduct a detailed examination of its role in these and other international financial institutions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speeches such as the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) do this Parliament proud. It was an extremely interesting and well considered speech. People may or may not agree with it all, but it certainly was a very thoughtful contribution to the debate. I am only sorry that, when people do talk about the activities of the Federal Parliament, they hear much more about the ravings and rantings of Jack Lang and others who, throughout history, have been expelled from the Australian Labor Party, rather than the very valuable contributions such as the one we have heard from the honourable member for Curtin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As every other speaker in the debate has said, the Asian Development Fund Bill authorises a contribution of $350m to the fifth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund, ADF6, which will be used to provide loans on soft terms to qualifying Asian Development Bank member states. The Bill, together with previous commitments to the international financial institutions, will add to the already substantial proportion of the global aid program of Australia committed to IFIs, as they are sometimes called&mdash;international financial institutions&mdash;in the years from 1992-93 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the ADF, the projection in the Bill does not show substantial draw downs until 1996-97. Interestingly, the share of ADF6 taken by Australia is lower than ADF5, reflecting both the large existing commitments by Australia to the World Bank and Australia's economic circumstances and its prospects. As others have said in this debate, we on this side of the chamber do not oppose this Bill but we make the point that the level of support Australia can give must be constrained by its own economic circumstances and that, as I have mentioned, is why our share of ADF6 is lower than our share of ADF5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin made the point that an increasing proportion of our global aid budget is going to development banks at the expense of bilateral and other multilateral aid programs. That comment demonstrates that this is a difficult issue of balance to which we have to give a great deal of thought. I am glad that the commitment in this case goes to the ADF, a bank within our own region, because we on this side of the House very strongly hold the view that a greater proportion of Australia's aid Budget should be directed to our own region rather than to other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect, on the one hand, on the rhetoric we have had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in recent weeks about the need for Australia to concentrate on its own region and to integrate more successfully within its own region and, on the other hand, on the fact that through the life of the Hawke-Keating Government the focus of the Government's aid effort has been as much extra-regional as intra-regional. The debate that we had some years ago about aid, for example, to the southern African states outside South Africa reflected the concern on our side of the House that we were not putting enough emphasis on our own region. For the Labor Party to have put so much emphasis on aid in parts of the world outside our region and to try to take on the weighty responsibilities of resolving problems in southern Africa and in Central America does not sit comfortably with the latest hot wind coming from the other side of the House on the need for regional integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill really raises the broader question of the different methods which can be used to obtain economic growth in developing countries which desperately need to get out of the cycle of poverty and achieve significant rates of growth. I think all of us in this Parliament are very committed to helping developing countries in our region&mdash;and of course outside our region&mdash;to achieve greater rates of growth where they are struggling, where they have zero growth or, in some cases, even less than that. But just providing aid in one form or another is not going to be the fundamental solution to the economic problems of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that too much of the debate in this country&mdash;what used to be described as the North-South debate&mdash;focuses on the need to provide increasing quantities of aid to try to resolve development problems in developing countries rather than on a range of other much more important methods which can be used to encourage growth. This is one of my last speeches as the shadow Minister for trade, so I really want to take the opportunity to make this point. I believe fundamentally that the greatest prospect of achieving economic growth in developing countries is to open the markets of the world generally to liberalise international trade so that those countries have the opportunity to find markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me as one of the cruelest post-war ironies that First World countries, the Europeans in particular, continue with the policies of agricultural protectionism to the extent that they ban altogether imports of many agricultural products from countries whose very survival and any prospect of economic growth is going to depend on gaining access for raw materials and agricultural products which they have available to them. I really think that is one of the cruelest ironies of the post Second World War world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great shame that in the general debate on development and these sorts of issues, such as the role of development banks, and in the broader debate about international trade, the case for developing countries is one that is so seldom put. It used to be part of the international agenda a decade or so ago when developing countries were arguing, admittedly not always very consistently, for something that used to be described as the new international economic order, and they operated as what was called the group of 77. But that agenda has just disappeared from international economic debate, very much to the convenience of the European Community, let me say, and significantly at the expense of developing countries, particularly those which are agriculturally dependent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to have a look at some of the data here. The World Bank has estimated that agriculture accounts for about 35 per cent of the gross domestic product for low-income developing countries, and between 10 and 15 per cent for middle-income developing countries. Food production on average employs up to 70 per cent of the work forces of low-income developing countries. It is really worth reflecting on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1965 agriculture accounted for 17 per cent of the GDP, on average, of the world's most indebted nations but it fell to 10 per cent in 1988. That happened not because people have stopped eating but because there is less incentive or capacity to produce food domestically. There is less incentive to do so because so many of those countries have simply been crowded out of international markets. So much of the aid program and so much of the work and contribution of development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank that we are debating this evening, are simply compensation for the utterly immoral agricultural protectionist policies of the European Community, to the largest extent, and some countries over and above the European Community. That is a case we need to argue in Australia. The Cairns Group needs to argue and the developing countries themselves need to argue much more vehemently than they have done in years gone by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not claiming that a lack of access to international markets is the only reason why a lot of developing countries, including developing countries in our own region, suffer from starvation and famine and very substantial humanitarian problems of that kind. That is not the case. In many instances, the problems relate to the lack of facilities to distribute food efficiently and also to the domestic economic policies of many developing countries. That has been particularly true in post-colonial Africa, but it has also been true in some of the developing countries in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their capacity to improve the quality of their agricultural production and to upgrade the productivity of crops, livestock and so on, has been inhibited in many cases by land distribution issues. The fact that governments have decided to nationalise land and that collectives have been created in order to administer land, rather than land being owned by individuals and run on traditional capitalist private enterprise principles, is one of the reasons that those countries have enormous economic difficulties. It is a part of the debate which we do not hear very much about any more today and that is a very great shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was glad to hear the honourable member for Curtin in his interesting speech refer to the work of Professor Peter Bauer, who used to be at the London School of Economics. Peter Bauer was one of the very few and great advocates of the cause of liberalising international trade and reforming domestic economic policies, providing for private ownership of land and competition to ensure that those countries worked their way out of their poverty. The first great aspect of achieving growth in developing countries lies in those two areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not walking away from the fact that development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, and the Asian Development Fund and bilateral and multilateral aid of other forms, can also play a very important part in helping countries establish the appropriate economic structure. Again, people will talk a lot about assistance with infrastructure, which is part of the work that the Asian Development Bank funds, but it is important that developed countries provide assistance in a lot of less tangible ways. For example, developed countries can assist developing countries in constructing efficient, modern taxation systems. One very good illustration is the International Monetary Fund and the OECD which have urged developing countries around the world to introduce an indirect tax system known as a goods and services tax. Those sorts of organisations and developed countries which have introduced modern indirect tax systems should be able to assist developing countries in setting up those systems. A lot of that work has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a growing proportion of developing countries, as well as just about all developed countries, have a goods and services tax system. A lot of assistance has been given by developed countries to help establish that system. They are not only establishing a proper and modern indirect tax system but are also assisting developing countries with establishing proper methods of accounting for government and private enterprise, and ensuring that there is a proper structure for competition policy within those countries as well. Then those countries can turn their backs on the old monopoly business situation which has characterised so many of them and move towards a competitive marketplace which, in turn, will create prosperity for consumers as well as producers and employees of those businesses. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just make the point that in the Philippines the refineries and, in particular, the sugar mills tend to be owned by a very small handful of oligopolists who exploit oligopoly rents at the expense of not only consumers of that product but also an efficient industry. I think that is profoundly regrettable. Again, my point is that developed countries, in assisting developing countries, can help them establish competitive industries and break away from the old style&mdash;usually left wing driven, but not exclusively&mdash;monopolies and oligopolies that have characterised those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the issue of straight-out aid and the sort of assistance that the Asian Development Bank can provide. The Asian Development Bank lent about $9 billion in the last fiscal year, and others have described how that money was lent. I think that can be a very effective form of aid. As I mentioned earlier, there is no doubt that that sort of assistance can help with the creation of appropriate infrastructure, giving those countries an opportunity to establish a structure for a more modern economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say it is important that, since soft loans are being provided in these cases&mdash;certainly as far as this legislation is concerned&mdash;those loans must go into investments which will yield a net return. Too often, in terms of aid policy, soft loan lending and, indeed, finance that comes from taxpayers' money in a range of other areas, that investment goes into projects which offer, if you like, a gross benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly clear that if a new road or whatever is built, some benefit comes from that. It is rather like the argument about the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. There is no doubt that if the railway were built, there would be a gross benefit from it. However, the question that must always be asked is not whether there is a gross benefit, but whether there is a net benefit and whether the costs really make that investment worth while or whether it would have been better to have put that money into some other sort of investment which would have yielded a bigger return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate, particularly with public sector infrastructure investment, that it is very hard to measure the net benefit or disbenefit that comes from that investment. Where money, albeit a soft loan, is provided by a bank, I suppose it is implicit that there will be at least some significant return because over time that loan has to be repaid. However, if it is a soft loan, there is clearly an element of subsidy and the net benefit, as a result of that, is all the harder to measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members really want an illustration of how to waste resources, not just in developed countries but, as the tone of my whole speech suggests, in developing countries, they should invest in just about anything that politicians happen to think is pretty or might help them to get re-elected and worry only about the gross benefits, not the net benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that nowadays people talk with great disdain about economic rationalism. People who criticise economic rationalism, by their own definition, are economic irrationalists. They measure only the gross benefits and never look to see whether there is a net benefit at all. That is the difference between an economic irrationalist and an economic rationalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to help developing countries, there is no point doing things which are irrational. There is no point pouring money in&mdash;however we pour it in&mdash;in a way that achieves nothing but a net cost, both to the country that is providing the assistance and, maybe in the longer term, to the recipient of that aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me finish on the point of humanitarian aid. Right at the beginning of this speech, I said that once money allocated to a development bank, such as the Asian Development Bank, is drawn down out of an aid budget, it is ultimately spent on that project rather than on other forms of aid. That has to be weighed up against what I think is the most valuable and important type of aid: humanitarian aid. When individuals within a country simply cannot obtain sustenance, we have a humanitarian responsibility to give those people assistance. I reckon that I speak on behalf of all 17 million people in this country when I say that none of us would want to deny humanitarian assistance to people in countries which are in very real need. </PARA>

Let us also ensure that, in future, the debate on assistance to developing countries is raised to a new level, which includes a debate about liberalising international trade and ensuring that domestic economic policies in developing countries are of assistance to the people within those countries, not just to monopolists and special interest groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Asian Development Fund Bill is to authorise a contribution of $350m towards the fifth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, who told us during his second reading speech that the contributions to the ADF was one of the largest single items in Australia's official development cooperation program. As such, the size of the payments can have a significant impact on other components of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps worth briefly reminding the House what the Asian Development Fund is all about. The ADF is the concessional lending arm of the Asian Development Bank. The ADB has&mdash;I have read various numbers ranging from 47 to just over 50&mdash;around 50 member countries from the Asia-Pacific region as well as from western Europe and North America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB really has four functions: firstly, to make loans to, and equity investments in, developing country members of the bank; secondly, to provide technical assistance for development projects and programs; thirdly, to promote investment of public and private capital for development purposes; and, fourthly, to assist in the coordination of development policies and plans of member countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loans from the ADF are available only to the least developed members of the bank at highly concessional rates. ADF loans are interest free, but carry a one per cent per annum service charge. Repayment periods range from 35 to 40 years. Other loans from the bank come from its ordinary capital resources and all developing member countries are eligible. The interest rate for OCR loans is currently 6.58 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF is funded through the bank's special funds. Special funds come mainly from contributions made by member countries. The special funds for the ADF have been replenished five times since the establishment of the ADF in 1973, and the sixth replenishment this year will total some $US4.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the case for humanitarian assistance is clear and I think the case for our assistance is clear. For economic and environmental reasons, it is important that Australia support the activities of the ADF to provide assistance to the poorer developing countries. It is not done just to make us feel warm and comfortable; it is really done for very practical, if not hard-headed, reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps when we talk about the Asian area a lot of thinking is going on in Australia about `think Australia', and about the importance to Australia of Asia and our links to it at the present time. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has, of course, just come back from an overseas trip to Asia. In the Fightback program, which the coalition put forward before Christmas, there is significant reference to our future needing to be tied in with Asia. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made many trips to Asia in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, as a nation we are changing our emphasis. Having gone from a dependence on Europe to a heavy dependence on the United States, we are now increasingly changing our direction towards Asia. Perhaps a lot of that thinking tends to be in terms of a warm glow about the opportunities. It is a warm glow about: `It's going to be the second biggest retail market in the world in the next 10 or 15 years' and, `Look at those wonderful commercial opportunities. Look at the five Asian tigers. Look at the way that Japan has developed economically and how powerful it is'. Those are all very true statements, but I think there are also very real concerns about what is going to go on in Asia in the next few years. If those concerns are not addressed, they are not just going to be disastrous for the people of Asian countries but they are going to rebound on us as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps a sobering thought to remember that there are two billion very poor people in this world and another four billion in the poor category&mdash;that is six billion who are officially deemed to be poor or very poor&mdash;and 70 per cent of that number is in Asian countries. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s, the cities of Asia will grow by a further 500 million people. That is equivalent to the population of the United States and Europe combined. That growing population, of course, is not always affluent. In fact, the vast majority are poor people&mdash;they are not the rich ones&mdash;and so they bring a lot of problems with them in terms of sheer numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the pressure on food production is quite horrendous, particularly when one looks at things like rice, which is the staple diet in many of the countries in Asia. There are a lot of problems with producing rice these days. In many of the intensive care areas one will see that, in fact, productivity is going backwards, for reasons that are not well understood, and a lot of research work is having to be undertaken at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge cities that are developing, of course, are gobbling up good agricultural land. The increased population is putting pressure on health services and on housing and education needs. There is often political instability. The over farming of much of the arable land is causing increased salinity and alkalinity. There is, as I said before, a noticeable decline in rice yield in intensive farm areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of that, if not all of that, often seems very remote to people here in Australia. But I put it to the House that, if there is no solution to many of those problems, there will be an explosion in economic and political terms onto the rest of the world. It will be bad for us in an investment sense, but it will also generate environmental and political refugees who will start to look in our direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who spoke before me and who should be congratulated on his recent elevation to the shadow Cabinet, made the point about the United States-Europe trade wars. I will not go into that again, but I think it is a significant factor that we should not overlook. Of course, as many of these countries do maintain their existing poverty or even get poorer, particularly in the rural areas, it drives people into the large cities which worsens the problems of overcrowding, living space, services and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that, just this week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Julian Cribb is doing a series on the global food crisis. Yesterday he wrote a very effective article, I thought, in terms of Asia in particular and I would commend it to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for the sorts of reasons that I have mentioned that the coalition has said very clearly in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document that our aid program will be structured, taking into account a number of criteria. The program will be concentrated within our own area, the Asia-Pacific region, which reflects our foreign policy and trade priorities. There will be increased emphasis on alleviating poverty and on the delivery of services through non-government organisations. Preference will be given to bilateral aid and the provision of Australian goods and services. Aid will not be applied in ways which support repressive governments or given to those with excessive military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of all of that is that we need to be stronger economically to be able to make a bigger contribution, and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mayo, dwelt on that at some length. We need to put our aid where we can influence some of the decisions to ensure that it does actually the good that we want it to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Australia is a very attractive country and has a good climate, although in Canberra it is slightly invigorating at the present time. We have plenty of space and a good standard of living. For many migrants this is a country that has `opportunity'. I speak as a migrant. I came here as a migrant, as many others have, and it is a tremendous country of opportunity. At the moment we might be arguing about our immigration levels, but if there are problems in Asia on an ongoing basis on a large scale, there will be pressure there to look in our direction. It is in Australia's self-interest to make sure that Asia avoids the catastrophe scenario. If Asia does well, then we will gain; but if it has a lot of problems and goes downhill, then inevitably we will lose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money for the Asian Development Fund must be committed. Australia has a history of support. Although historically that fund has had a number of management and accountability problems, those are gradually being addressed. There have also been control problems and issues about where the funds are directed. Perhaps there has been an increasing shift in emphasis over the years in the type of project being undertaken. For example, I understand that there is an increasing importance on the environment, women in development and poverty alleviation in the assessment of projects. Like all organisations, it does have its inefficiencies. We should support it, but we need to look more critically at bilateral aid as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look not only at better targeting in a country sense, or which country we pick, but also at the type of project and method of delivery. We should consider not only the social or short term economic facts but also some of the longer term factors that are relevant in terms of giving aid. For example, earlier I was talking about the problems with food, saying that the rice yield in intensively cultivated areas is going down. It seems to me that some of our aid needs to be given in technical assistance to investigate some of those problems that can have widespread long term benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I tabled in this place the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into genetic engineering. It seems to me that Australia has growing expertise and abilities in this area and we can look at giving some real practical aid&mdash;not only dollars but real skills&mdash;to help our neighbours to the north with some of those problems. There are many outstanding features and discoveries in the agricultural field that are on the way that I am sure will be very useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I served in the forces in Asia more than 30 years ago and saw some of the basic lifestyles enjoyed&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;by many of the people in the Asian countries at that time. Looking at it through European eyes, we probably took the view that many of the Asian countries had lots of character and local colour. However, it really was not so good for the indigenous people at all. That is not necessarily the case in many of those countries now and many have advanced tremendously. Nevertheless, there are far too many people who are living in really appalling circumstances because of the increasing population. Pressures are applied simply through better communications: however poor a country is, people have television screens; they have a window to the outside world to see how good it can be. Therefore, they are all looking for a better standard of living and their expectations are raised. Lifting themselves out of poverty&mdash;and often ignorance, unfortunately&mdash;is obviously very difficult and our help is needed. Careful targeting is required. We have a responsibility to provide that help because it is in our interests as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I will take a few minutes to remind honourable members of the size and scope of the problem that is on the nation's doorstep. Bangladesh, a country which I think we all understand is riven by natural disasters and appalling poverty, has a population in excess of 100 million people. China has over one billion people. We are all aware of such things as the political problems, the communist influence and whether it will crack, the impact of what is going to happen to Hong Kong, and the economic development. It has tremendous problems. Some of its remoter regions are still living in the Middle Ages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India, with its caste system and endemic poverty in so many areas, has over 800 million people. Indonesia, our nearest neighbour, has over 180 million people spread over many islands over a two million square kilometre area. The logistics of getting around that area are frightening. Pakistan, which is surrounded by countries either at war or on the verge of war, has over 100 million people. How does it improve its economic lot in that situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Philippines, where I suggest corruption is reasonably endemic and political instability is never far from the surface, has over 60 million people. Then we have the beautiful little island of Sri Lanka<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>, which has been torn asunder by civil war. It has a small population&mdash;not quite 20 million people&mdash;but it is still a heck of a lot more than Australia's population. Thailand has 60 million people. Perhaps it is relevant to mention Thailand, because at the moment we are recalling the days of the Burma-Thailand railway in another sense and from another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked up some figures for the amount of annual income per person for 1989 in Australia, which were the latest figures I could get. The average income per head is just over $15,000 in this country. The annual per head income in India is $301. That is 2 per cent of what it is here. In Sri Lanka it is $390 per head for a whole year. That is 2 1/2 per cent of our figure. In Indonesia it is $473. That is just 3 per cent of our figure. In Thailand, people do very well. The figure is $1,130. That is still only 7 1/2 per cent of what we get in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the middle of the worst recession in 60 years in this country, those figures still make us look pretty good and remind us of our responsibilities to help our less fortunate neighbours. It is a daunting picture. The Asian Development Fund is one mechanism for helping. I commend it to the House. Having approved it, I think it is important that we remember that we should not sleep easy in our beds, because the problems of Asia are only just beginning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all the participants in this debate this afternoon and this evening: the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), from the Opposition side, and those three amigos from Queensland, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), from the Government side. Each of them made a contribution worthy of some comment, principally for what they had to say, and also in terms of providing the opportunity to clarify one or two points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going to that, I will briefly reiterate the main benefits arising from Australia's contribution to the Asian Development Fund, because I think they got lost in some of the contributions this evening. Firstly, the Asian Development Bank is the largest regional multinational agency delivering concessional finance to the poorest countries in the Asia-Pacific area. Australia, as the fourth largest donor and the second largest regional donor, has been able to have a significant influence on the activities of the bank in a number of important areas. I think that is quite significant. For example, the bank is now playing a much larger role in the Pacific island countries, our neighbours in this region&mdash;as has been stated by a number of honourable members on the other side&mdash;which we are so concerned about. The bank plays a lead role in aid coordination and policy dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, contributing to the ADF complements the rest of our development cooperation programs. The bank has become involved in a number of areas where we have a limited capacity under the bilateral program. It can implement much larger infrastructure projects as well as negotiate policy changes as a condition for the approval of the loans. Again, I think that is appropriate. It can provide loans in sectors that Australia would support but where we do not have a comparative advantage. I think those two very important points need to be made. However, there are others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB supports programs in a number of very poor Asian countries where we do not have a significant bilateral program. There was conjecture about bilateral versus multilateral programming and so on; I use by way of example Bangladesh and Pakistan. This is an effective means of achieving our humanitarian objectives, and I am sure no-one in this House would object to that. The proposed contribution, in fact, represents an appropriate balance between maintaining a significant influence in the bank and efficiently achieving the priorities of Australia's bilateral aid programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, a number of comments were made by honourable members on both sides of this House and I would briefly like to touch on those. The three Government members, of course, gave a fairly clear and erudite explanation as to the reasons behind the passage of this legislation this evening. They clearly also demonstrated their understanding of the aid program and the dimension of the aid difficulties facing Australia, but so, too, did a number of the honourable members from the Opposition and I think that shows the degree to which this issue enjoys bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some misunderstandings, and I would very briefly like to go to those in summing up this Bill tonight. Firstly, in respect of replenishment sizes, the honourable member for Warringah spoke at some length about the fact that the replenishment sizes were only just maintaining the same level of real lending. I would like to point out that, with great respect to the honourable gentleman, he is somewhat mistaken. There has recently been a change in policy by the ADB and the board of directors agreed that repayments from existing loans could be used to finance new loans. In the past, of course, these repayments were accumulated. These funds are now drawn down for new loans and the ADF has an additional $US1.5 billion available for new commitments plus the $US4.2 billion funded by donors under the ADF6 replenishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Warringah was also somewhat critical about the reporting of the ADB project performance. In fact, again, he is mistaken because the ADB has changed its policy with regard to evaluation activities and will now have a more comprehensive coverage of all its projects and programs&mdash;and I am sure honourable members on both sides of the House will find that an appropriate change in policy. The bank's post-evaluation system has been very useful in terms of identifying the reasons for past failures. In particular, it appears that projects in new sectors with new executing agencies have more problems than other projects. The honourable member, in fact, commenced his speech by commending the change in the sectoral focus of the ADF lending. It is, therefore, only reasonable to expect that there may be an initial decline in performance while both the ADB and the recipient agencies gain the necessary experience to implement projects very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member was also somewhat critical about the reporting on the performance of structural adjustment program loans. I would like to clarify the situation for his benefit. The bank's program lending only began in 1977 with fairly modest aims. Given that evaluations can only be meaningfully assessed some time after the completion of the project, there is not a great number of projects to draw on. Nevertheless, of the first nine program loans approved, six were rated as generally successful and the other three were rated as partially successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, a key lesson that is coming out of evaluating program loans is that policy reforms must have broad based support and commitment from within the country itself. To achieve lasting change and to sustain the desired policy directions, a long term continuing commitment by the bank through a series of programs may be required rather than just a single operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member for Warringah was somewhat critical about the bank's approach to environmental concerns and the protection of its projects. The bank has recognised that its programs should reflect careful environmental planning and management, something which, I think, in this day and age, all members of this House should support. Environmental policy framework was in fact adopted in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of measures have now been enacted including: the identification of high priority environmental projects, environmental impact assessment statements on projects with significant environmental impacts themselves and, of course, enhancement of environmental planning capabilities in recipient countries. All those measures represent a change in the way in which the bank approaches this particular issue. Unfortunately, it was an issue with which the honourable member for Warringah was seemingly not conversant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commenced his contribution by saying that the Minister responsible for this legislation was not in the House. As the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for introducing the second reading speech, I inform him that I listened very carefully and watched every sentence pass his lips on the television while I was preparing to come to the chamber tonight. I have also sat in on the other contributions, so I am fully apprised of what he had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member was supportive of the Bill but expressed a number of concerns. He was critical of the Government for not taking the House seriously, as I have mentioned. I think we have dealt with that particular issue. He was also critical of the bank's assessment categories labelled `generally successful', `partially successful' and `unsuccessful'. He wondered what each of those categories meant. The categories are based on calculated economic internal rates of return and use a number of indicators in this assessment and, therefore, provide an appropriate way in which to assess the level of contribution and the way in which the projects are being successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England was critical of just about every aspect of the aid program. He was into multilateral aid and bilateral aid. I am not sure whether he could quite work out which part of aid he was into. I am pleased that the new shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), is in the chamber listening to this debate. He is following a very difficult act, which I will come to in a moment. The right honourable member for New England also said that something like 85 per cent of Australian aid returns to Australia for procurement of goods and services&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order!  The Parliamentary Secretary does not need the assistance of honourable members on my left. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The right honourable member also asked how much money would be used for administrative costs, which I was about to elaborate on for the benefit of those opposite. The answer is none. The ADB's costs are paid for by a one per cent administrative fee on loans. Again, I would have thought that would have been known. He was also somewhat confused about how much is being paid to the ADB. As was stated in the second reading speech, payments will be made over the years 1997-98 and the years 2000-01. It will average something like $83m a year compared with the payment of $49.5m made since 1990-91. Therefore, the reason for saying that there has been a decrease somewhat escapes me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) also commented, in somewhat negative terms, on the fact that Treasury officers have been the Australian representatives of the bank. They were a little critical of that fact. I am pleased that the honourable member for Dundas is with us tonight. The present Australian executive director of the bank's board is from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, AIDAB, which of course is the Government's overseas aid agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inadequate level of senior Australian appointments to the bank is a matter of concern to those on the other side. Australian representatives on the bank's board have played a significant role in successfully encouraging the ADB to adapt more transparent staff selection procedures. As a result, it is much more certain that the best person for the job will be selected in future. I think we would all agree that is an appropriate mechanism to put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned about the rhetoric from the honourable member for Curtin. It was almost a complete misrepresentation of the role of the Asian Development Bank. There is no doubt that the needs of the poorest countries in our region greatly exceed the funds provided by donors, but to say that the ADF is looking for new recipients to use up the funds is somewhat nonsensical. For example, Vietnam is not receiving funds only because it has not yet paid off its arrears to the IMF. Vietnam is making great efforts to comply with the demands of its creditors and is very deserving of assistance from the multilateral development banks. Cambodia, to which the honourable member referred, is also a very needy recipient. I am pleased to say that the ADB's board of directors recently approved a technical assistance project to Cambodia. China has the largest number of poor people but is making great efforts in improving its economic performance. The reason for its exclusion was its creditworthiness; it had nothing to do with any other issue. It does not make sense to penalise a country for performing well; the needs are still very great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo informed the House that he was making his farewell speech in his role as shadow spokesman for trade. He actually made some points with which I fully concur. The irony of the post-war era is that EC protection keeps out the agricultural exports of developing countries&mdash;hence, many of the countries in our region&mdash;while giving huge amounts of aid to those same countries. We fully endorse that. That is why we are so active in the Uruguay Round of negotiations. We are concerned because those subsidies and the role being played by European countries hurt not only developing countries in our region but also Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member for Aston, in a very cogent and well argued case, clearly reminded us all of the size of the problem in developing countries in our near region. Clearly, he was concerned about ensuring that the importance of our Asian neighbours was recognised by this House and that Australia must have a responsibility for helping those less fortunate countries in our near region. This was clearly demonstrated by his reference to yearly income receipts of Australia compared to those of people in many Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, I think the range of issues canvassed tonight were appropriate. I am pleased that those on the other side of the House have chosen to support this legislation. I wish it speedy passage through the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before the House the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill 1992, which seeks to make certain amendments to the principal Act of 1990, which bears a similar title to the Bill under present consideration. Although we have concerns with some aspects of the Bill, and with respect to one of those concerns we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage, at the end of the day we will not be opposing passage of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 October 1990 the House debated the 1990 legislation, which sought to give effect to the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which was entered into in 1988. The 1990 legislation was designed to put in place at the Federal level the legislative framework needed for Australia to proceed with ratification of the convention. The basic thrust of the 1990 Act, which is yet to become law, was to extend Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes relating to drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, and relevantly, subsection 5(1) of the principal Act preserves the division of responsibilities between, on the one hand, the Federal Government and, on the other, State and Territory governments. However, the Bill, for reasons which I will explain in a moment, seeks to alter that division. That is one of the concerns that we have with the Bill, which in due course I will elaborate on. Before addressing the concerns that the Opposition has with the Bill, it is appropriate that I give a very brief outline of the Bill, because it is so long since it was last before this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has five elements. First, the Bill inserts into the principal Act a definition of `serious State drug offence'. Secondly, the definition of `dealing in drugs', as presently found in section 6 of the Act, is to be widened. Thirdly, the Bill will amend the Act to provide that, where knowledge is an element of an offence under the Act, such knowledge may be proved by way of inference from the circumstances surrounding the conduct giving rise to the relevant prosecution. Fourthly, the Bill once enacted will create additional offences under the Act of converting, concealing or acquiring property derived from a serious State drug offence. Finally, provision is made for regulations that may prescribe the States and Territories to which the amendments as contained within the Bill will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that the Opposition has with the Bill are threefold: firstly, the impact that the amendments may have on the division of Federal-State responsibilities in the area of drug offences; secondly, the definition of `serious State drug offence', and in particular the reference to the threshold requirement that such offences must carry a minimum penalty of 12 months imprisonment; thirdly, the introduction of an objective test for the requisite fault element for an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to consider the question of Federal-State responsibilities. At the time the 1990 legislation was debated the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said that the Government was concerned to respect the traditional division of responsibilities in the area of drug offences. The Attorney also said that the Government would not ratify the convention until consultations with the States and Territories were concluded. In this regard it was envisaged that ratification would not take place until all States and Territories had passed legislation dealing with the confiscation of assets and money laundering in the context of State or Territory drug offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Federal Government has now chosen to rely on the external affairs power and the convention to fill the gaps found in some State and Territory jurisdictions in this area. I note that in his second reading speech the Attorney did not say whether or not the States and Territories have agreed to the passing of legislation&mdash;which we now find before the House&mdash;that will enable ratification to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I fully appreciate and support the obvious importance of Australia doing what it can to tackle the drug problem, both at an international and domestic level, it is important that the traditional Federal division of power and responsibility not be usurped. Accordingly, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) to advise the House what attitude the States and Territories have with respect to the amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the Bill seeks to insert into the Act a definition of `serious State drug offence'. In essence, a serious State drug offence is defined as involving conduct that is prohibited by the provisions of section 6 of the Act where such conduct constitutes an offence against State or Territory laws punishable on conviction by imprisonment for at least 12 months. The amendments, once they become law, will have the effect of invoking the additional offences, as contained within this Bill, of converting, concealing or acquiring property derived from a serious State drug offence. I note that the new Federal offences attract, on conviction, a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty we have with these provisions is that, having regard to existing State and Territory legislation, the threshold requirement of 12 months imprisonment may be too low. In this regard, there are a myriad of State or Territory drug offences carrying terms of imprisonment above 12 months which, generally speaking, may not be considered to constitute `serious' drug offences. In other statutes, such as the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, a `serious' criminal offence is defined as involving a threshold requirement that such offences attract penalties involving imprisonment for a minimum of seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the fact that the attitude of the States and Territories to the amending legislation is unknown, there may be a concern that the 12-month requirement is far too low. Again, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify this on behalf of the Attorney and advise what discussions there have been in selecting and identifying State and Territory drug offences which ought to form the basis for the invocation of the new Federal offences contained within the Bill. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) may now be interested in this, being a distinguished member of the Victorian Bar. Proposed section 8A provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"8A.(1) If a particular knowledge, intent or purpose is an element of an offence against this Act, that knowledge, intent or purpose may be inferred from objective factual circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(2) Subsection (1) is not intended to exclude or limit any other way of proving knowledge, intent or purpose as an element of an offence for the purposes of a prosecution.".</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very real risk that these provisions may alter the burden traditionally placed upon the prosecution to establish the mental element needed to secure a conviction for a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to trace this point through. I reiterate that we are not opposing the Bill. We may oppose this clause because of the alteration in the burden of proof. The provisions of proposed section 8A reproduce the terms of article 3.3 of the convention. However Australia would not be obliged to adopt word for word the tests set out in article 3.3. In the first place, the convention provides that the implementation of its provisions is subject to `constitutional principles and the basic concepts of the legal systems' of signatories to the convention. Secondly, on a number of occasions the High Court has held that, in passing legislation pursuant to the external affairs power, parliament need not slavishly reproduce the terms of the relevant convention in the form of a code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 8A may introduce into our criminal law an objective test for the establishment of an accused's state of mind. This is contrary to a very long line of authorities. It is very well recognised that establishing the requisite mental element for any offence is in theory well nigh impossible for, as Chief Justice Brian said as far back as the fifteenth century, `The devil does not know man's intention'. Nonetheless, despite these difficulties, our common law has insisted that the relevant test of guilt involves establishing the actual state of mind of the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, the law is not concerned with the state of mind of some hypothetical or reasonable person. In contrast, proposed section 8A appears to be primarily concerned with the question of whether a reasonable person would foresee the natural consequences of his or her conduct. As a matter of</PARA>
<PARA>principle, this is erroneous.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, in the 1952 decision of Stapleton v. the Queen, Sir Owen Dixon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the maxim or statement that a man is presumed to intend the reasonable consequences of his act is seldom helpful and always dangerous. For it either does no more than state a self evident proposition of fact or it produces an illegitimate transfer of the burden of proof of a real issue of intent to the person denying the allegation.</PARA>
<PARA>In a similar vein, Sir Garfield Barwick, in the 1971 decision of Pemble v. the Queen, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although what the jury think a reasonable man might have foreseen is a legitimate step in reasoning towards a conclusion as to the accused's actual state of mind, a firm emphasis on the latter as the fact to be found by the jury is necessary to ensure that they do not make the mistake of treating what they think a reasonable man's reaction would be in the circumstances as decisive of the accused's state of mind.</PARA>
<PARA>Although it may be somewhat trite to observe that a jury may always draw inferences as to an accused's state of mind, what proposed section 8A fails to do is state the qualifications to the reasoning process that a properly directed jury should undertake when drawing such inferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, I refer the House to the judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court in the 1988 decision of Pereira v. the Director of Public Prosecutions in which it is said that although the necessary mental element may be inferred from the circumstances, there are three qualifications. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, in such cases the question remains one of actual knowledge. It is never the case that something less than knowledge may be treated as satisfying a requirement of actual knowledge. Secondly, the question is that of the knowledge of the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused, although, of course, that may not be an irrelevant consideration. Finally, where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that proposed section 8A does not embody these qualifications, there may be an argument that parliament, having turned its mind to the issue, decided to displace its application. In my view, and in the Opposition's view, this would be a most undesirable consequence. For these reasons, as I indicate, at the committee stage we will seek to amend to delete proposed section 8A so that the position at common law may be preserved and protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that the provisions of proposed section 8A would appear contrary to the recommendations made by the Committee for the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, in its interim report of July 1990. In that report, the Gibbs Committee recommended that the minimum fault element for a criminal offence should be recklessness. In this regard, the requisite fault element for a criminal offence can be comprised of knowledge, intention, recklessness and negligence. It would seem that the test found in proposed section 8A may be akin to the objective test of negligence. This may mean that a prosecution would only have to prove that the accused ought to have known of the consequences of his or her conduct and the prosecution would not have to establish actual knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the proposed test may affect the well recognised defence that, in cases of strict liability, it may be a circumstance of exculpation that the accused had an honest and reasonable belief which, if true, would have rendered his or her actions innocent. Given that the net cast by the provisions of the principal Act in terms of offences relating to dealings with drugs is extremely wide, it is in our view wholly inappropriate, as the Gibbs Committee recognised, that the requisite mental element for such offences be anything less than reckless. </PARA>

We added to them the Southern Cross on a blue background, from 1851, and that represented part of our heritage.

That is in stark contrast to the National Party's position in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party members in Queensland have made it very clear that they are protectionists and do not support these sorts of policies. Mr Borbidge said that if he cannot convince the coalition to rethink this issue, the Queensland Nationals might have to reconsider their support for Fightback. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herbert River Express</EMPHASIS> of 28 April 1992 made the following reference to Mr Bob Katter, one of the candidates for the National Party in Queensland, who comes out with some real pearls of wisdom:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Katter instanced the failure of the oil companies to lower prices in line with a drop in the World price and said it was unlikely CSR would easily give up profits realised through the `Fightback' package and pass them back to growers (through the Division Of Sugar Monies), as suggested by Senator Macdonald.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the National Party candidate does not have much faith in the comments that have been made by Senator Macdonald. Interestingly, Mr Howard Hobbs, the shadow Minister for lands in Queensland, said in response to an interview question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe there needs to be assistance to keep industry on the road to recovery and so, quite obviously, we do have some problems with regard to the total Fightback package as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Queensland we certainly aren't doing that. We've always believed that we need to have a certain amount of protection and we have unashamedly in this policy launch put it as a policy of protection because we believe that the people out there need some assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>He later added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We really just cannot get down to having zero tariff barriers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite evident from these comments that the National Party in Queensland does not agree with the honourable member for Maranoa or the Federal Leader of the National Party and will run its own agenda once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that the National Party has a challenge: whether it wants to lie down and politically disappear or try to restore some of its pride and stand up. If it does wish to restore some of its pride, it has to change its position and leadership. Interestingly enough, if we look at some of the other comments that have come out of the sugar debate over the last few weeks, we find Senator Boswell saying, `We are going to stand by the sugar industry'. Senator O'Chee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party position in Queensland is totally unified. We are opposed to the Federal Government's cutting of tariffs and we are going to fight it all the way, and we ask for a little bit of support.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Boswell said the same. Tonight in the Senate when an opportunity to debate this matter was brought on by the Democrats, what happened to Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee? Not only did they not participate in the debate; they did not even participate in the vote. They ratted and they ran away. </PARA>

Every time he gets up, he criticises the National Party. I think he doth protest too much; he might be a closet National Party member. I might have a talk to him a bit later because every time he opens his mouth he attacks the National Party. All honourable members here would know that; they would hear it in his adjournment speech every night. The honourable member for Hinkler keeps attacking the National Party. If he wants to join the National Party I will send him along a little piece of paper; he can sign up; pay the amount of money and join the National Party. He should not keep on attacking us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is something psychological about this. I think that he really loves us, but he loves to attack us also. We will have to watch the honourable member for Hinkler. I am going to get out all the recordings of the Parliament to see how many times he has attacked the National Party. It is a real worry to me. I am worried about the honourable member and I think he ought to go and get checked out about this. It is a real worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in this place we were talking about the big zero for inflation. The zero that the honourable member for Hinkler and his Leader should be worried about is not the one zero for inflation, but the six zeros that come behind the figure one and that represent the one million unemployed in Australia today. That is what we should be worried about. Those opposite can talk all they like about the zeroes in inflation, but that is not helping those people who are standing on the dole queues, standing in line at the soup kitchens, because they cannot afford to buy the things they should be able to buy which are affected by zero inflation, or not affected by zero inflation&mdash;whatever you like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about the national debt. Let us talk about the divisiveness of the Leader of the honourable member for Hinkler. Today I heard the honourable member for Hinkler give a speech in which he said that our trade with Asia is increasing by 80 per cent per annum. Yet today in this place we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say, `Look, we don't know about our identity. We have to trade with Asia. We have to get rid of the Australian flag because we have to orientate ourselves with Asia and we cannot do that while we have the Union Jack on our flag'. Why we cannot do so, I do not know, but this is part of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program I heard the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) say that our trade with Asia is increasing at a dramatic rate. Yet we hear the Prime Minister say, `We have to be orientated towards Asia if we want to do any good'. Someone is wrong. It is a little bit like this argument about the National Party which we hear all the time from the honourable member for Hinkler. I think the Prime Minister ought to get checked out too, because I just cannot follow the logic of the argument. Needless to say, Mr Speaker, that is not what I really got up to speak about tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to talk about early intervention and, in particular, the reading recovery program. Reading recovery is a school-based early intervention program. It provides a second opportunity for children in year 1 who, after a year at school, have not established effective reading and writing processes. This is a program which is something extra for six-year-olds. Each child has an individual program designed by a trained reading recovery teacher in response to the particular needs of the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take this opportunity to tell honourable members a little about this excellent extra learning program. Reading recovery was first trialled in New Zealand between 1976 and 1979. Initially it was a trial and error procedure, although based on thorough research and observation, with follow-up research with the children in 1981. It is now regarded as an established, triangulated program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reading recovery scheme currently operates in New Zealand, where it is a national program for the lowest 20 per cent of all six-year-olds. It has been operating in Victoria since 1984 and has involved some 17 tutors, 550 teachers and 4,700-odd students. It has also been operating in the ACT since 1987, and commenced in New South Wales last year. Overseas countries also have reading recovery programs: Ohio in the United States of America since 1985; Canada since 1989 in six out of the 10 provinces; and last year it was taken up by the Surrey Local Education Authority in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is okay to talk about programs such as this, but what about the results? In New Zealand only one per cent of children require further support; in Canberra there has already been a success rate of some 96 per cent. It has, of course, meant quite dramatic changes in teacher training and classroom practices. Trainee tutors undertake a specific training course in a tertiary institution. In Victoria this two-year training course comprises both theoretical and practical components. The trainee tutors attend lectures, in-service sessions and participate in daily teaching of individual children. Once trained, the tutors have the responsibility of guiding the professional development of the teachers in reading recovery teacher in-service programs and the administration of reading recovery in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experienced infant and junior primary teachers participate in a 12-month teacher in-service program conducted by a reading recovery tutor. This involves attending fortnightly in-service programs as well as daily teaching in their own schools of children in a reading recovery program. The teachers develop an awareness, through observation, of the children's reading and writing behaviour and gain an insight into their own teaching practices. This increased awareness enables teachers to understand the children's problem or problems and to assist in the rapid development of children's reading and writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been clearly demonstrated that reading recovery is very effective indeed and that it enables students, in an average range of 12 to 20 weeks, to make rapid progress in their reading and writing skills. In fact, the great majority of children within this program change from being ineffective readers to active, independent problem solvers, and are able to meet the challenge of reading and writing full-on in both the classroom and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this program been such a success? It has enabled early detection of reading difficulties&mdash;which usually result in writing difficulties&mdash;and rectification of this, thus enabling the child to participate fully and effectively in the classroom. The program for the early detection of reading difficulties has given our educators an awareness of what is really needed to effect real change. It has enabled strategy orchestration and observation and reinforcement by teachers. It has been found to be a self-improving system which allows children to aim for independence. The acquisition of literacy involves some of the most complex forms of learning. Even the best schools with the best teachers will have some children who will require something extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now well documented that failure to achieve literacy in primary schools makes school learning difficult and frustrating and creates employment and lifelong problems. As we would all be aware, poor self-esteem and personal and social behaviour problems are often the result. Ninety-five per cent of the prison population in this country is functionally illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this House many times, and I say it again, that education is an investment in the future, and prevention costs less than the cure. I commend those involved in the reading recovery program and wish them every success. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the will of the people is clearly expressed in an election, as happened in Wills, it should not be frustrated by an artificial interpretation of the Constitution. Section 44(iv) of the Constitution says that a person who holds any office of profit under the Crown is incapable of being chosen or sitting as a senator or member of this House. It goes back to the early days of English parliamentary democracy when it was feared that the King might buy the loyalty of parliamentarians with patronage. Today there are obvious problems with this provision of the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only Australian court decisions on the point are old ones which apply in the States. They give little guidance to candidates for election to the Federal Parliament. People standing for election to this Parliament are presumed to immediately know the answers to such arcane questions as: what is an office of profit? When is it under the Crown? Does `chosen' mean `elected'? I think it does. I ask why public servants are advised by the Electoral Commission to resign before they nominate as candidates rather than before the declaration of the poll, which seems to be the only moment when they could be chosen. These uncertainties are further complicated by the Federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem concerns the purposes sought to be achieved by the office of profit provision. As it has been interpreted, some of these purposes are not desirable ones. Members of parliament obviously should not have the right to draw two salaries from public sources, nor should they, by virtue of continuing to hold some Public Service post, be placed in a position to influence executive government which goes beyond their role as a parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the office of profit provision is currently applied makes it a bar to Commonwealth and State public servants standing for parliament. This is because the Electoral Commission makes candidates at the time they nominate declare that they are not disqualified from entering parliament by section 44 of the Constitution. Public servants running for parliament are therefore forced to resign their jobs and gamble their livelihood on the election result. People in private employment do not have to do this. To make matters worse, different States impose different rules when their public servants unsuccessfully stand for election and then try to get their old jobs back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the increasing politicisation of the Public Service, the risk is also increasing that public servants who unsuccessfully stand for election will find themselves out in the cold. There is also a double standard. Parliamentary staff have a cosy arrangement. They stand for parliament with a firm understanding that their job will be there afterwards if they are unsuccessful. In practice, it is one rule for the politicians and their retinues and another rule for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of profit provision in the Constitution discourages public servants from standing for parliament. That is against the principles of democracy and it attacks the democratic right of several million Australians. I think it comes down to what is meant by the word `chosen'. As it is used in section 44, it should mean that one cannot be elected or sit in parliament while holding an office of profit. That would allow anyone to nominate as a candidate, to stand for election and, if elected, to take their seat in parliament provided they resign their Public Service position prior to the official declaration of the poll. This interpretation of section 44(iv) still protects the public revenue. It also prevents parliamentarians from holding a Public Service position and exerting undue influence on executive government. There could be acceptable circumstances in which a parliamentarian can hold some additional position in government such as membership of an advisory board or a rank in the Army Reserve. I have seen the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Peter Collins, wearing a naval uniform. I assume that he must hold some office under the Crown which allows him to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs made recommendations which would have cleared up this whole murky area. Both major parties have been in government since 1981. They both had the opportunity to do something about it and they did nothing. They are happy to keep millions of Australians from participating in the democratic process. It suits them to throw obstacles in the path of people such as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) when they stand for election to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us would know that very recently we had a major Christian celebration&mdash;the celebration of Easter. I was delighted to find that in Logan City, a city of 130,000, on Good Friday we had close to 1,500 to 2,000 people turn out for the Passion Play, although as some members of the minister's fraternal pointed out probably more people turned up for the free lunch afterwards. However, that may be a little unkind and perhaps not quite in the spirit of Easter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the Passion Play is a reminder of a part of our European heritage, not specifically British. In fact, the Passion Play comes from Oberammergau and other places. Very many of the participants in the Easter celebrations were from all parts of the world. During the week prior to Easter we had a very large celebration for the end of Ramadan. For those people who may not know, Ramadan is a very sacred time for the Muslim community. Those people fast from sunrise to sunset and pray quite seriously. With the end of Ramadan comes an enormous feasting festival which comprises two or three days of eating, with children wearing new clothes, and an enormous amount of joy. Most of the Muslims in our community look to a whole range of places within the Middle East, the Far East or, now, the Near East, depending upon where they come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as those celebrations, the New Year has been celebrated by a very different group of people in our community&mdash;the Cambodian Buddhists. They, too, found within our community a cause for rejoicing. In fact, hundreds of people turned out for what was a fantastic day. A very special group of Buddhist monks came to our city from Sydney and, indeed, a very special Buddha was brought to the celebration for the occasion. Very many of those people would experience joy in the celebrations not only from having escaped from the horror camps of the killing fields but also from living in Australia and experiencing those things Australian. Their Buddhist celebrations are very much a part of Australia, as are the Muslim and Christian celebrations of Easter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period has also been finalised in terms of religious celebrations by the Coptic Christian and Orthodox Easter. That has been marked by a whole range of very large communities in our cities and towns throughout Australia, with great eating, great festivals and great religious celebrations. A very large Romanian group also celebrated widely. It was great for the economy. There were all sorts of new clothes and lots of eating and festivities. Similarly with all our Coptic Christian friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply highlight these facts to show what Australian society is about. It is about the Christians celebrating Easter, about Muslims celebrating the end of Ramadan, about the Khmer Buddhists celebrating the New Year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one of the most amazing amalgams of the celebrations was at a Vietnamese wedding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several measures are available of the international competitiveness of Australian industry. The most commonly used measures are based on indices of unit labour costs (ULC) and prices (CPI and GDP deflators) in Australia relative to our four major import sources (USA, Japan, UK, and Germany) adjusted for exchange rate changes. The following table shows the three indices over the period 1985-86 to 1990-91. A fall in the index implies an improvement in Australia's competitiveness.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quantitative measures of competitiveness are subject to certain limitations as they make no allowance for other factors affecting competitiveness such as product quality and service reliability. In addition, comparisons are very much affected by the starting point chosen for the purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. On these measures, between 1985-86 and 1989-90 Australia's competitiveness vis a vis our major trading partners deteriorated by:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">14.4 per cent in CPI terms;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">11.8 per cent in ULC terms; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">13.2 per cent in GDP terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. These movements in the competitive indices must be placed in context. The substantial depreciation in the exchange rate significantly improved Australia's competitiveness in the two years to 1985-86. The subsequent upswing in the $A exchange rate, in particular between July 1987 and February 1989, when the $A increased by 14 per cent on a trade weighted basis, was an important contributor to the erosion in competitiveness in this period. In the case of the ULC based measure, this deterioration has compounded by a continued steady increase in Australia's wages relative to movements in trading partner countries, as well as slower growth in Australia's productivity performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Since 1989-90, all three measures have indicated an improvement in competitiveness, reflecting the small $A depreciation during the year and lower domestic prices and wages growth relative to overseas. Overall, since 1982-83 Australia's international competitiveness has improved by around 18 per cent on all three measures.</PARA>

The former ratio would be meaningless, while the latter would give a broad indication of currency of aircrew to an informed observer who is concerned about safety.

This strategy includes minimising the amount of sediment runoff during rainfall, the installation of gross pollutant traps to catch litter and coarse sediment, use of water pollution control ponds upstream of large urban lakes or the river, and the provision of a high quality sewerage and sewage treatment system. The sewage treatment plants reduce the phosphorus in effluent to very low levels. In addition, the ACT Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning has directed that an Environmental Audit of the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre be conducted to assess the nature, extent and potential impact of all pollutants associated with its operation. This Audit will include the level of nitrates discharged into the Murray-Darling system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The Australian Film Finance Corporation Pty Ltd (FFC) invested in the production of a one hour television documentary entitled "Sacred Sex". The FFC did not provide additional funds for the production of the feature film; (a) $205,474 and (b) the television documentary fulfilled the eligibility criteria under Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and Australian content criteria, market appeal and investment requirements of the FFC. The latter requires that the producer achieves some form of private sector participation. In this case the producer sold the documentary to the ABC, to IKON (Netherlands) and to television NZ. Film Australia Pty Ltd, as the sales agent for the rest of the world has sold the program to North and South America and is negotiating European sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes; the television production was certified by the delegate of the Minister as meeting the Australian content criteria set out under Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; the production entity is entirely Australian owned, the director and the writer are Australian, the bulk of the funding was Australian and all creative control was in Australian hands giving the program an Australian perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The FFC does not make an independent assessment of the artistic merit of projects. It relies on the judgment of broadcasters, distributors and other experts in the marketplace, whose decisions to pre-purchase or invest in the program will have taken artistic merit into account. The FFC invests in "qualifying Australian films" under Division 1OBA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The FFC makes its assessment on the basis of the track record of the producer, the financial deal the producer has put together, whether the proposed budget is appropriate to the script and the potential returns to the FFC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The producer/director and co-producer/ researcher of the documentary "Sacred Sex" had previously produced and directed the documentary "Rajneesh&mdash;Spiritual Terrorist" in which the FFC had invested. The FFC is unaware of any connection beyond this. (a) Yes (b) AS part of the assessment procedures of the above project and (c) the project fulfilled the criteria outlined at (3). It would be inappropriate for the FFC to make decisions based on the religious affiliations of the applicants.</PARA>
