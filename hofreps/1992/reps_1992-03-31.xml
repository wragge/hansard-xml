In fact, in the late 1980s when Australia had demand running at more than twice product growth, when GNE was running at 9 1/2 per cent and GDP was running at about 4 per cent, we saw demand spill into imports. We could not produce more than about 4 to 4 1/2 per cent GDP. I might say that that is after 30 years of coalition government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, guys, I can understand your groaning because it is something to groan about. All the economies around us can do 6 to 8 per cent without spilling into imports. But the most we can do is what our capital stock would allow us; that is, to produce 4 per cent before all the demand spills into imports. We have been about trying to lift that productive capacity and rebuild the capital stock through the 1980s, which fell apart from about 1965 until the early 1980s. Apart from the mineral boom, which was investment in mining, in the rest of the economy, and certainly at the elaborate transformation of product, investment fell to pieces. So we could run the place at about 4 per cent per year, and that was about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his question. I am delighted to be able to respond because what has happened to manufacturing industry in the last 10 years is little short of spectacular.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that we have been assiduously engaged in a trade liberalisation strategy which is about not only ensuring that manufacturing industry in Australia has the capacity to compete on the Australian market, but also that it has an export orientation, an interest and an incentive to export and earn export dollars, export income, for Australia. This is a highly respectable strategy for us to be adopting. It is a strategy which has been urged not only upon us but also upon others interested in trade liberalisation by the World Bank. It is one which not only involves a restructuring of industry assistance, such as tariffs and quotas, but also involves providing support more directly for exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Prime Minister's most recent statement we provided some additional resources for Austrade; some additional resources for the development import finance facility to allow for the export particularly of capital equipment; extra support for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation; and increased support for the export access scheme. That is on top of the ongoing support which is provided through the export market development grants scheme which, in its own way, has been very helpful to exporters as they promote their exports and as they develop their export opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland asked me what has happened in the last 10 years. I think it is interesting to compare what has happened in the last five years with what happened in the five years leading up to the assumption of government by the Australian Labor Party. We find that in the last five years of the former Government manufactured exports were growing at just 4.2 per cent per year, whereas in the last five years they have grown to 7.2 per cent&mdash;almost a doubling of manufactured exports as a result of the success of our policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, if we look at the area of sophisticated manufactured exports we find that under the old regime, that tired old regime which scrounged its way through the 1970s and into the early 1980s, export growth was 5 1/2 per cent, whereas under us in the last five years it has been growing at 15 per cent&mdash;three times as much as the annual growth of exports of sophisticated manufactured goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important change, and it is one which will continue in the future so long as there is the kind of appropriate support and the appropriate supportive policies that are necessary to continue that change. The Opposition, of course, pretends to be interested in manufacturing industry as it rips to zero every tariff and every other support mechanism in sight. Not only that, it is intent on ripping to bits those programs which also support our exporters more directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that micro-economic change will make all the difference. In the two pages of the 800 devoted to micro-economic change, the Opposition holds out the prospect that here is the answer for Australian exporters, particularly manufacturing exporters. The honourable member for Barker may have got it right when he said&mdash;I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By `micro-economic reform', what the Hughes Committee and others . . . mean is, enabling things to be done better . . . through eliminating waste and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>listen to this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">making use of our resources, both human and cattle.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way in which he intends that we should make better use of and provide better opportunities for our exporters. In even more illuminating fashion, he went on to say that by 1995 there will be little need for an export market development grant scheme or others like it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a hidden part of the consumption tax package of the Opposition. Nowhere has it said that it would eliminate these programs. But, of course, the honourable member for Barker has let the cat out of the bag. Here is another half a billion dollars worth of programs which the Opposition intends to get rid of because it says that Australian exporters will not need them by 1995, as a result of the implementation of two pages of policy, out of the 800. It is not surprising. We have had, since Federation&mdash;</PARA>

I draw your attention to a ruling given by your predecessor on 12 February 1986 which led to a Minister being asked to curtail an answer. Indeed, the Prime Minister of the day was asked to sit down because of the length of his answer to a question. I draw your attention to the fact that we have had just two questions in 12 minutes. This answer has now been rolling for some seven minutes, with the prospect of it rolling further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry&mdash;inflation. The fact is that in 1988-89, in the height of the boom&mdash;when demand was running at twice the capacity of the economy<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS> to produce; when there were shortages of labour; when pressure was on the accord and the inflation rate; and when employers were offering 12 to 15 per cent wage settlements&mdash;had those tax cuts not been there, instead of coming through this recessionary period from a peak of about 6 or 7 per cent inflation, we would have begun at about 11 or 12 per cent. Instead of being at 1 1/2 per cent now, we would more likely be at about 7 per cent. That is what the tax cuts of 1989 did. They broke the inflationary cycle in Australia for the first time in 20 years. They proved that we could go through a period of high growth and high demand without busting the wages system and without wages breaking out. That is what the effect was in 1988-89.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing now with our tax cuts is again providing a climate which is conducive to reasonable and moderate wage settlements to keep the inflation rate down, whereas the tax cuts of the Opposition are paid in lieu of the GST. We have the same tax rates as you in that middle range from $20,000 to $40,000 with no 15 per cent GST. As a result, it will provide a much better wages climate for low inflation. In the maintenance of low inflation, which all of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> forecasts have, we will have interest rates lower in nominal terms than we have had for 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the assertion of Senator Walsh, that rates will go back into high double digits, basically has no basis to it. How can it if the inflation rate remains low? Off an inflation rate of 3 per cent-odd, to go back to double digit interest rates, we would need real rates of interest of 8 or 9 per cent. There is no point and no reason why Australians should be burdened by such rates. Therefore, I see no basis to the argument. Even in 1989, when we paid tax cuts worth $6 billion, we still produced a surplus of $8 billion; it was the greatest surplus in our history; it was one of the only three or four surpluses produced by this Government in our history. So that is the principal fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh's view of the world is essentially gloomy. It is that we should be producing surpluses forever. Let me make this point: if we produce surpluses for the next four or five years and we bring all of the Commonwealth Government securities back into Treasury&mdash;in other words, there are no Commonwealth securities on offer&mdash;what will the Commonwealth do with its surpluses? Will it start buying CBD towers in the capital cities? Will it start buying assets? What will it do with its surplus? Opposition members say that we should then sell them all, because the Opposition is into privatisation. The fact is that all of these things are exaggerations on the part of Senator Walsh and the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there is nothing wrong with handing back tax cuts of the variety that the Government intends, to produce a climate to keep the inflation rate low and, with it, lower interest rates. The only way Australia will get lower interest rates is with a low, underlying inflation rate. We have proven that we are the only party in national politics which can produce low inflation and keep it there.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was attempting to say that, in the context of the introduction of a goods and services tax, the assumption of a reduction in real wages is a quite crucial one. But subsequent studies have shown that, if this assumption does not hold&mdash;that is, if money wages move up with the increased inflation&mdash;then the economic outcomes will be quite disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such study was conducted by the same Dr Murphy who modelled scenario C. He showed that if wage increases were obtained to compensate for the inflationary effects of the GST then GDP would be 4 per cent lower in five years time than it would be otherwise. In making that calculation, he was using only part of the package&mdash;that is, a 3 per cent inflation impact not the more like 5 per cent figure. If he had included the rest of the package, obviously he would have had an even greater fall in GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, the study by Dr Michael Porter and Andrew Chisholm shows that if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflation stemming from a GST, then GDP actually declines. So the wage behaviour in the context of a GST is clearly quite crucial to the economic outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is most unlikely that the wage and salary earners will act benignly in the face of a large inflationary surge stemming from the GST and just accept reduced real wages. Firstly, this is because the compensation package is far from adequate. We have already shown, through the Treasury analysis of the distributional effects of the GST, that something like 70 to 80 per cent of wage and salary earners would be worse off under the package. In those circumstances, they would not sit by and idly cop it sweet; they would take strong action for compensating wage increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the ACTU, which has some say in wages policy in this country in deciding how unions pursue their claims, has said that following the release of the Opposition package there would be further wage claims. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 25 November last year, in which Mr Kelty said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unions would continue to base their wage claims on the movement in the Consumer Price Index seeking wage rises to maintain workers' real living standards and compensate for the effect of the GST on prices.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that the union movement, in its first look at this, was concerned to make sure that real wages were maintained and it would adjust wage claims according to the GST effect on prices. What it has seen since, from the distributional analysis, would not have changed that view very much, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Opposition parties would have no mechanism for restraining any wage claims other than to contract the economy further by severely tightening monetary policy. Of course, if it did that we would have more economic contraction and higher unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, complete deregulation of the labour market, which of course is the thing that those opposite hold up as some sort of saviour, would do absolutely nothing in these circumstances to restrain wage claims. If there is complete deregulation, what is to stop people making wage claims to catch up for the inflation impost of the GST. You have no accord and there would be no trade union agreement, as there is at present, to keep wage increases to a level which would give us a price outcome comparable to that of our major trading partners, or less. All that would be lost with the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason at all to believe the Opposition assumption that there would be a reduction in real wages; that there would simply be an acceptance in the context of the GST by those who make wage claims and that they would not pursue higher wage claims. In those circumstances, the effects on GDP and unemployment would be quite disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one impact that would certainly come from this proposal, and that is industrial disputation. With the additional wage claims would undoubtedly come some resistance from employers. We would be back to the old system of high levels of industrial disputation. The 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes under this Government would be a thing of the past. In other words, under your package, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> would mean that everybody starts fighting and we all go backwards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to advice from the National Food Authority and other expert bodies, an Australian family of two adults and two young children would require about 35 megajoules or about 8,000 kilo-calories of food energy per day, which would include about 142 grams of protein from items such as meat or from 3,200 milligrams of calcium such as in milk.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the House may have noticed reports, citing the Real Estate Institute of Australia, that in the December quarter 1991 the national affordability ratio was at its best level since the March quarter 1988. The report confirmed the results of the Commonwealth Bank-Housing Industry Association index, which showed affordability at its highest level for over three years. These improvements in affordability result largely from cuts in official interest rates flowing through into substantial reductions in mortgage interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant improvement in affordability has underpinned the recovery in the housing sector. That recovery is now very well established. Housing starts have risen for three consecutive quarters and are at their highest levels since September 1989. The major contributor to this growth has been the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leading indicators create a picture of further growth in the March quarter 1992. Dwelling approvals for the three months to February are up 3.7 per cent, despite the fall of 7.4 per cent for February reported today. The fall in February was due to a sharp decline in public and other private approvals after very strong growth in the preceding two months. Private houses, which represent around three-quarters of the total approvals, rose by 4.7 per cent. That is consistent with the Government strategy, which was to bring forward public sector approvals and commencements in the course of last year when the recession was very strong, and that allows us now, as private sector approvals are getting much stronger, to begin the process of winding back the contribution being made by the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reports from builders and lenders also add to our confidence in the upward trend in the housing sector. A. V. Jennings, Australia's largest home builder, claimed a sales record in February 1992, beating its previous high of two years ago by 10 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank and the New South Wales based St George Building Society have reported increases of over 60 per cent in home lending in the first two months of this year. The HIA latest survey of volume builders shows that new house sales rose by 15 per cent in February. All the factors, then, are in place for the recovery to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the cut in official interest rates in January 1992 is yet to be fully reflected in housing demand. The conditions are there for a restoration of confidence. Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 17 March reported that lending institutions said that affordability had restored consumer confidence. The Real Estate Institute reports that there was a marked improvement in confidence and outlook during February amongst buyers and vendors. The Institute noted that first time home buyers activity in Melbourne was at its highest level on record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage the recovery is simply a matter of confidence. The evidence is there that the recovery is under way. As that recovery grows we can expect, as the Master Builders Association indicated today, that we will achieve the target of the Indicative Planning Council of 137,000 starts this year. Against that situation, all we hear from the Opposition is whingeing, whining, negativism, and talking down any sign of recovery&mdash;in fact, talking down the industry. The problem of those opposite is that, rather than seeking the good, rather than seeing what is best for the Australian people, rather than contributing to the growth of confidence and stability of the housing industry, all we get is a negative approach, an approach which is about the Jeremiahs rather than about seeing the strong recovery that is occurring and is so important for new home buyers who are now, I am pleased to say, strongly back and present within the housing industry.</PARA>

<PARA>In the past several days in this Parliament and elsewhere, we have had a succession of examples of how this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will say or do anything for short term political gain. He will deliberately set out to misrepresent the circumstances to satisfy his particular needs at any point in time, irrespective of the consequences of those statements or those actions for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw it most recently last week in his backdown on the protection position that we understood his Government had supported for a large part of the latter half of the 1980s. Of course, today we have clear evidence from one of the ex-senior members of this Government, the ex-Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, in an interview reported in an Australian magazine which clearly demonstrates the extent to which on many occasions this particular Prime Minister has deliberately sought to misrepresent the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the Prime Minister is in the tradition of Australian Labor Party leaders, as was summarised by Senator Richardson last year&mdash;when the Kirribilli conspiracy was exposed&mdash;when on Sydney radio he said that Mr Hawke had been justified in breaking his promise because it helped keep the Liberals out of power:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I know is that the betterment of Australia will justify almost anything.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the principle on which those in the Government work: what is in their political interests at any point in time, irrespective of the consequences, is justified. The end, their political survival, justifies the means&mdash;any statement, any action, any statement, anywhere, at any time&mdash;in order to deal with an argument or a pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the remarks made by Senator Walsh today were particularly telling when he referred to the actions of this Prime Minister. When asked about the Prime Minister's behaviour, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this is one thing about Paul. Sometimes what politicians say in public is not what they believe. It's not uncommon for there to be a divergence between the two. But leaving that possibility aside, if he does believe all the different things he has said, he has the capacity for self-delusion.</PARA>
<PARA>Either he was deliberately deluding and misleading the people of Australia or he was deliberately deluding himself in terms of the statements that he has made in the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to take some of the specific points made by Senator Walsh in this interview to demonstrate just how far this man will go to deliberately misrepresent the circumstances that we have seen come to fever pitch in the last few weeks as he has panicked under pressure in the Wills by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might start, for example, with a point which was the basis of a question to the Prime Minister today about whether or not the Budget numbers in this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, that is, the numbers on page 149, are in fact Treasury numbers. Senator Walsh very carefully says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table.</PARA>

I know what you referred to earlier on page 120; but does that cover what is on page 149, attachment B? Is it or is it not a Treasury table? Is Senator Walsh right, or is Senator Walsh wrong? The fact is that Senator Walsh is right. Treasury would not sign off on this table. This table is a deliberate misrepresentation of the likely course of events in this country in the next few years. You produced this table in your office, to make things look better than they are, to mislead the people of Australia, and that deception has been exposed very clearly by Senator Walsh in his comment today that it is definitely not a Treasury table. Senator Walsh would know, having had so many years as the Minister for Finance in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has gone out of his way, even in Question Time today, to obfuscate on that particular point, trying to distract attention from the fact that this was produced in his office for his particular political ends. As a consequence, the tax cuts promised in this document are undeliverable. He knows it, Senator Walsh knows it, and Senator Walsh has now exposed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area that we can take out of this statement by Senator Walsh today which demonstrates the extent to which this Prime Minister will go to misrepresent the circumstances relates to his continuing assessments of the shape of the economy. We have seen many examples of how he has deliberately misrepresented our economic circumstances for his own political ends. Remember how many times he denied that there would be a recession before the last election campaign. He kept denying it and he kept denying it, and then finally, of course, it became apparent in the data that there was a recession. Then, of course, it was a recession we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh has given us a number of other examples of this sort of deliberate deception on the part of this Prime Minister. One of the most telling examples relates to the period in 1986 to which Senator Walsh is referring, when in relation to the conduct of fiscal policy he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keating has argued publicly that we ran a tight fiscal policy throughout the 1980s because the private economy was going along well and there was no need for compensatory government spending. . .

<PARA>and this is the crucial point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at the very time that the private sector was going into a shallow recession&mdash;and we knew it was going into a shallow recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet in mid-1986 this Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, was asked a specific question: `Are we close to a recession?', to which he replied on 30 May 1986, `No, not within cooee of it'. That is a classic example of where Senator Walsh has clearly exposed the extent to which in 1985-86 this man deliberately went out to mislead Australians in the course&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third example of the Prime Minister's deception and misrepresentation has to do with the recession itself and the reason we had a recession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not care how I speak. I will get the point across. I could talk about the gross malaise of the epoch, but I would not be prepared to pick on the way you speak. How we speak is irrelevant. The substance of the point is that the Prime Minister has gone out of his way to blame everybody else but himself for this recession. There are some telling examples that we can take from the past. On 5 February 1991, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The performance of the Victorian economy is, I think, basically the cause of why we saw these negative growths in GDP, why we have the word recession in our newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 February 1991, it was Victoria's fault. On 8 February 1991, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria is not to `blame' for the recession. Nor is the recession Victoria's `fault'. The Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slowdown.</PARA>
<PARA>These examples show that, within just a few days of each other, he has completely changed his explanation of what has happened. It is little wonder that in an article in March 1991, Peter Smark pointed out, very accurately:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating has blamed the Fraser Government, entrepreneurs, the banks and a cast of thousands for causing the recession. This week he added real estate agents and the Wool Corporation, and reached back through 25 years of pre-1983 governments in his relentless hunt for the culprits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of the extent to which there are now so many explanations on the record; yet only one explanation is right&mdash;the one that Senator Walsh gives as to why there is a recession: the excessive reliance on monetary policy. Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the `recession we had to have' was in fact the recession we didn't have to have. The recession is a function of the over-reliance on monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA>He spells out why that process could have been avoided. This man, deliberately and knowingly misleading the people of Australia, stuck to his high interest rate policy way beyond the point he was advised to do so, pitched this economy into  recession, threw one million Australians out of work and inflicted the worst pain and hardship on average Australians since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we can go to some specific issues. We had another example in the Parliament today of where this Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the circumstances. One example of classic leadership weakness is Coronation Hill. If ever there was a mine or project that had been cleared on every conceivable ground and should have gone ahead, it was that project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The litmus test.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a litmus test of leadership in recent days. The previous Prime Minister failed that test of leadership and the current Prime Minister also failed that test of leadership. I think his handling of this issue is a very clear example of the type of person he really is and the sorts of arguments he puts. In Question Time today he referred to the fact that he put his position on the record in 1991&mdash;on television, I think he said in his answer&mdash;that he supported it but, of course, he lost the job of Treasurer and could not carry it through. If we look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for March this year we see that he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered all the issues, including the Aboriginal heritage issues, and decided against it.</PARA>
<PARA>He gave his imprimatur to that position in relation to Coronation Hill. As we read Senator Walsh's document we find the true reason for the position that has been taken by this man on Coronation Hill. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way in which I can account for the Coronation Hill decision, or non-decision if you like, is that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gave an undertaking to some caucus members in return for leadership votes.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that it is one stage worse than that. The Prime Minister did deals with Caucus members for votes, but he did that on both sides of the issue. He told some members, in order to get their votes, that he would not let it go ahead; he told some members, such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), that he would let it go ahead. On 23 December the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'll be watching Mr Keating like a hawk&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>interesting use of the term&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to see if he delivers on overturning the ban on mining on Coronation Hill.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there is another part to the deal of that particular honourable member. He is looking for the cuts in immigration, and they have not come yet either. What does the Prime Minister say when he is asked about deals? On 21 January 1992 on the John Laws program again, where all the major policy statements in this country are made&mdash;I will have to be careful because, if I keep saying John Laws, every other radio announcer in the country will get into me for giving him a free advertisement, but this man has made a lot of major statements on John Laws&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not do any deals with anybody&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>you can just imagine him saying this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean you make alliances, friendships and things, but they are not deals. Deals go to people getting positions and policies and what have you.</PARA>
<PARA>Half of the Party of the Prime Minister was told of the policy of no mining at Coronation Hill, and the other half of his Party was told of the other policy of definitely letting mining at Coronation Hill go ahead. The only person who benefited from those deals was the Prime Minister. One job was saved&mdash;his job. He got the top job, and we lost about 630 jobs in Coronation Hill because that project did not go ahead. That is indicative of the type of person that this man is. He will take any one of those circumstances or issues and he will say or do anything; he will deal with anyone; he will even deal with his colleagues on both sides of the issue to get what he wants, irrespective of the consequences for the average Australian. Another example in this document from Senator Walsh today is a very important one which is to do with the Accord. Senator Walsh refers to that fact in his assessment. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ran a pretty permissive wages policy through the 1980s. True, we didn't have a wages explosion. . . but year after year, the government said it was all right to have nominal wage increases of 7 per cent. Given that there was minimal productivity growth and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a clear-cut, damning statement of the wages policy that the Prime Minister has boasted about and misrepresented for the course of the whole of the 1980s. Indeed, we can just go to his One Nation statement and pick up some of the doozeys. Page 44 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Accord between the Government and the ACTU has delivered unprecedented wage restraint since 1983. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is repeated again on page 13 of that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unprecedented wage restraint.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, as Senator Walsh correctly said in endorsing the arguments that we have put for years, that you ran a pretty permissive wages policy&mdash;and why? Because you were locked into a deal with the ACTU on wages and you were forced to deliver, irrespective of the consequences for the worker&mdash;their real wages fell in the end because you did not control inflation&mdash;and irrespective of the consequences for Australia, because we lost any hope of being internationally competitive when our wage increases and nominal unit labour costs were roughly double those of our trading partners right through your time as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final area that we can pick out&mdash;and a very politically sensitive area that Senator Walsh dwells on&mdash;is the issue of the tax cuts that have been promised. Separate to the issue that they are unfunded and that their delivery has not been not based on any figuring by Treasury, Senator Walsh goes out of his way to warn us that we are about to see the same mistakes made that were made in 1989. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing from 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if it is going to be taken seriously, that's a formula for very largely repeating the mistakes of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>He is arguing here that the Government should not have delivered the 1989 tax cuts. It did not need to deliver them to get inflation down because the Prime Minister just pitched the economy into the deepest recession in 60 years. Inflation was going to fall like a stone anyway, but he delivered them because he had done a deal with the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go back to that statement I made about `no deals'. He does not do deals with anybody because deals imply that somebody gets privileged access to government; somebody gets a privileged position in government. This is a man of privilege looking after a few key mates such as union leaders and a couple of backbenchers whose support he needs in relation to Coronation Hill. Hang the consequences for the average Australian! You could not care less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh is very revealing because he goes on and criticises this Prime Minister in two other respects in relation to tax. Firstly, he says that in essence these proposals are, in effect, a flat tax. Just to show this man's view of flat tax in the past, before he came to having to try to buy his way back into government, I remind the House that when he criticised us when we talked about imposing a flat tax, or a flatter tax system, and using a consumption tax, he said that that would blow our society to pieces. You are not going to blow our society to pieces? Of course, the argument does not matter; the circumstances are what matter. He needed a point against us, so he used it. He said, `If you would believe that it would not blow our society apart, then you are more naive than I thought'. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to maintaining a progressive tax system, whereby those in the community with a higher capacity to pay tax bear a higher share of the taxation task.</PARA>

After all, the statement was a statement by the Prime Minister, compiled in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, not in the Treasury.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just massive dishonesty on your part to be doing this sort of thing. He then goes on to talk about how Senator Walsh has argued about how we run fiscal policy and a flat tax. Understand this about Senator Walsh: he believes in 60 per cent marginal tax rates. He opposed me when I cut the rates to 49 per cent in 1986. He wanted the top personal rate left at 60 per cent, with relatively low thresholds. If you are endorsing high marginal rates of tax at those rates, say so. But do not quote Senator Walsh attacking me for reducing the tax rates of Australians. Senator Walsh will attack anybody who reduces the tax rates of Australians because he is basically concerned with a high nominally progressive tax scale&mdash;not effectively progressive, but nominally progressive. The fact that people do not pay it and did not pay it always escaped him. Nobody paid the 60 per cent rate other than PAYE taxpayers. We made the system more effectively progressive by removing the free lunches, the credit cards, and cars, and imposing capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. We made the system more effectively progressive, and I do not apologise to anybody for it. I do not think the social compact ought to apply with penal rates of tax as we see in some of these countries which are often lauded by people&mdash;countries such as Sweden with 80 per cent and 90 per cent marginal tax rates. Who would want to live in a country where 80 per cent or 90 per cent <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>is taken&mdash;a confiscatory tax regime? What liberty is there left for people with that sort of tax policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we made the clear, distinct and philosophical point that the rate was 49 per cent&mdash;it was just under half and the state did not collect more than half. Senator Walsh always objected to that and his objections were dismissed by the Government. He is still running that argument today. In your silliness, you want to quote him. What do you want to do? After all, they were your rates, pal&mdash;60 per cent. I had to bring them down. But here is your former adviser wanting to go back to them and quoting Senator Walsh about high marginal tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition then goes on about the permissive wages policy through the 1980s and he quotes Senator Walsh on that. I remember distinctly having a conversation with Senator Walsh in 1989 when he was complaining about the tax cuts then. I said, `Okay Peter, wages will take off at 12 to 15 per cent in this quarter. What do you think we should do about it?'. He said, `Oh, I don't know, but we shouldn't pay the tax cuts'. I said, `Yes, but that blows the whole inflation rate to pieces'. He said, `Oh well, that's the unions; they've got to pull their head in'. The fact is that it would not have happened. The market would have driven us to double digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who had responsibility for policy had to make judgments about these things. There is no point Peter Walsh or anybody else raking over old coals. The fact is we are sitting here today with a 1 1/2 per cent inflation rate&mdash;game, set and match. The fact is that wages did hold in the recession. He calls a wages outcome of 6 to 7 per cent in a boom when inflation was running at 7 to 7.5 per cent&mdash;that is, travelling at the inflation rate or just below it&mdash;permissive. What does Senator Walsh require of us&mdash;further massive real wage cuts in a boom? Really! And you want to go and quote it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Coronation Hill is concerned, I was asked a question about this by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I will make these points about it. The value of the gold production over the life of the Coronation Hill mine is only about $285m&mdash;that is, if you do not rehabilitate the mine. That is not profits; that is the value of the production. The mine was estimated to have a net present value of $82m. If it had to be rehabilitated&mdash;as it would have to be, given its position on the South Alligator River&mdash;how much of that net present value of $82m would be left upon that rehabilitation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this mine was a small mine. If we look at Marandoo, it is estimated to be worth $250m per year in exports&mdash;not overall, not $285m over its life; but $250m per year. Newcrest mining itself admitted that the Coronation Hill mine was not big. On 30 May 1991, Mr John Quinn said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I just heard the Leader of the Opposition interjecting that I did deals on both sides. I made my position clear about Coronation Hill in June 1991. That is how I would have voted when the matter came to Cabinet; I would have voted for an arrangement to be made between the Aboriginal community and the mining company to work it out. Cabinet, in its wisdom, decided otherwise. The Labor Government decided otherwise. A decision was made and, as far as I am concerned, the decision should stand. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the Opposition has picked this up and come in today with this hotchpotch under the guise, again, of a censure motion. What has the Government done to deserve a censure from the Leader of the Opposition on this matter? References by a senator and former Minister on issues of policy over the last couple of years and contemporary opinions apparently deserve from you a censure motion. It is an abuse of the Standing Orders. You do not understand what you are doing over there; that comes from your relative inexperience in the Parliament.

He is not one of the enemies of the Prime Minister and honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating); he is one of the people who, with the Prime Minister, had blood on his hands when they deposed Bob Hawke to put this Prime Minister into the Lodge at the end of last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me run through the 10 points which form the basis of Senator Walsh's remarks. Firstly, he just explodes as a myth this claim that the relationship between the Labor Government and the trade union movement and the resulting accord have been of benefit to this country. The truth of the matter is that at the heart of many of our economic problems has been Labor's accord with the trade union movement. Here you have got it in black and white. Senator Walsh stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">True, we didn't have a wages explosion like 1981-82 or 1974-75, but year after year, the government said it was alright to have nominal wage increases of 7%. Given that there was minimal productivity growth and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that policy, contrary to what those opposite have been saying, has been an absolute and dismal failure; that is point one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point two is that the way in which the Government put together its numbers in its recent bit of catch-up politics, the One Nation statement, was very revealing. We have been saying publicly that the numbers are shonky. Today we have proof from Senator Walsh who says, for instance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table.</PARA>
<PARA>Game, set and match! And the Prime Minister confirmed it in what he said following Question Time in response to the censure. The truth is that these numbers are just being cooked up so that the Government can go on and say anything and do anything to substantiate its case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point three is a classic. It is just a clear statement from Senator Walsh that when the Government said in 1986 that the private sector was going pretty well it in fact privately knew that we were headed towards a recession. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) showed in a quote that, when the Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, was asked, `Are we heading towards a recession?', he said, `We are not within cooee of it'. The interesting thing about Senator Walsh is that he has shown that the Government knew that statement was in fact false. It was in fact just a straight, bald faced lie. It is as clear as that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Point four is a critical point again from Senator Walsh. First, we now know that some of the numbers the Government used were shonky, and that further substantiates our case that this whole pack&mdash;a house of cards if you like&mdash;constructed for the tax cuts, to substantiate the question of where the money is coming from, is not true. It is built on quicksand, paid for on my bankcard&mdash;that is, the One Nation statement&mdash;and you have got it here from Senator Walsh in black and white telling you so. I quote him exactly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing from 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>In the time since the `One Nation, One Job' statement has come down, we have had an absolute avalanche of independent commentators on the question of whether or not this scenario, these forecasts, was accurate. This week the National Australia Bank said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this scenario may be a desirable objective, it is, in our view, unlikely to be met in the first half of the 1990s because of inherent sluggishness in the domestic economy, following the spending binge of the late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to raise the question and its concerns about the fall off in economic activity in Japan and the state of the world economy. So the scenarios on the basis of the National Australia Bank are clearly overoptimistic with clearly shonky numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is more than that. Look at Richard Blandy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> that came out today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect, One Nation offers "blue-sky" tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not bad&mdash;blue sky tax cuts, basically plucked from thin air to make a case. The numbers are shonky, as Senator Walsh says. Professor Blandy then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "fistful of dollars", on this occasion, comes from One Nation, not Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another endorsement of the critical point made by Senator Walsh&mdash;that there has been an avalanche. One can go to the Treasury's own document, which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, in respect of the coalition's Fightback package. When asked about the possibility of a 4 per cent growth rate&mdash;and remember the Government's projections are 4.75 and then an average of 4.5 per cent&mdash;Treasury said in respect of 4 per cent, `This would be a significant challenge'. That is a very nice Treasury subtle statement but, in other words, `You haven't got a ghost of a chance of making your forecast'. They are your numbers. Look at what the CAI says. It refers to the forecasts, et cetera as `the unrealistic nature of the forecasts', and it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Statement is a product of what ought to be by now the discredited Keynesian formula for growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not read all of the quotes, but they damn the statement from start to finish. One can then read what Ross Gittins said yesterday. He is not exactly a card carrying member of the Liberal Party, but I think he sums it up rather well. On the protection debate&mdash;but it has a broader meaning&mdash;he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating's amazing attempt to portray himself as an Old Protectionist shows he's so desperate to stay Prime Minister he's prepared to say anything. The real question is whether he is prepared to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">do</EMPHASIS> anything.</PARA>
<PARA>Catch this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone interested in distinguishing between rhetoric and reality will need to keep his bulldust detector going full blast in the long, ear-battering haul to the election.</PARA>
<PARA>Syntech, professional economists advising on matters economic in Australia, say about the Government's forecasts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's own forecasts depict an external deficit that would leave us still at the bottom of the barrel in the international balance-of-payments ranking over the next five years. But, like too much of the rest of this obliging official framework,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is referring to the forecasts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the official external deficit projections are far too optimistic for the scenario they accompany.</PARA>
<PARA>There could not be a more damning indictment of the basis upon which the Government has proceeded. Lastly, one can look at the responses of the business community to One Nation. Let us remember that this was a statement directed to kick-starting the economy and giving people a sense of confidence about the future so that we could overcome the appalling fall off in investment in recent years. The whole thing is built on assumptions that suddenly, as at 1 July, people are going to wake up that morning and reckon the recovery is going to be here and they are going to go out and invest. When a survey was done by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABM</EMPHASIS> magazine this year, people were asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you believe that the economic statement has created an environment to stimulate capital investment by your company in 1992-93?</PARA>
<PARA>What were the responses? Seventy-nine per cent said no. Another question asked was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How would you rate the chances of the initiatives creating 800,000 new jobs over four years?</PARA>
<PARA>Given the choice between `Realistic' and `Unrealistic', 90 per cent said it was unrealistic. Then there was the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the current international economic environment do you believe that sufficient initiatives have been taken to generate a growth forecast of 4.75% in 1992-93?</PARA>
<PARA>The noes were 84 per cent. Lastly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic statement combines capital works expenditure with tax and other concessions. Will the combined effect be sufficient to kickstart the economy?</PARA>
<PARA>The noes made up 48 per cent and those undecided 37 per cent. So the whole thing is built on a pack of cards, built on quicksand, and is simply not going to happen. Senator Walsh's comments today finally blow away any pretence of credibility this Government has, based on its One Nation statement and its expectations for the future. But that is only point No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 5 goes to tax scales and the design of Labor's One Nation tax scales. Honourable members will remember that ACOSS, again not card-carrying members of the Liberal Party, said that Labor's policy was regressive. It said it because half of Australia's taxpayers, those on the lowest incomes, those on less than $20,700, will not get one cent out of Labor's tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh goes further, because he says that it is taking the tax system closer towards a flat tax. That really blows apart the credibility of the Government and of the Prime Minister particularly, because he has railed against flat taxes claiming that they are likely to blow society apart, yet here is Senator Walsh saying that that is the sort of tax policy introduced in One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 6 goes back to what happened in 1989. Senator Walsh simply makes the point that in 1989 the Government should have cancelled the tax cuts that were then projected. Its failure to do so led to very high interest rates. There is a warning here for every Australian: high interest rates are on the way back again under the One Nation statement outlined by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point No. 7 Senator Walsh admits the importance of getting marginal tax rates down, and this is a critical point of the coalition's tax policy. Point No. 8, of course, blows away the Prime Minister's credibility on Coronation Hill. Point No. 9 talks about the Prime Minister's lack of honesty in dealing with the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, in point No. 10, Senator Walsh admits that the person responsible for this recession is in fact the current Prime Minister, which is why he is entitled to be called Mr Recession. In conclusion,  this document pulls away the last vestiges of the Government's credibility. The Prime Minister deserves to be censured. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Censure debates used to be taken seriously in this place. Censure debates were about whether a government still had the confidence of the House. Yet we have had two quite derisory speeches in the context of a censure debate, first of all from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and then from this joker who waddles in to present the second supporting speech on behalf of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand that we are talking about one thing and one thing only: an interview given by a Labor senator and produced in a journal which for years was the official intellectual outpouring of the Communist Party of Australia. This is the journal which decided to carry an interview with Senator Walsh. This is Peter Alexander Walsh, not to be confused with Maximilian Walsh&mdash;although I must say that when one looks at their two views, one finds them reinforcing each other, one finds them becoming increasingly the dismal duo of economic commentary in Australia. One finds that both Maximilian and Peter Alexander are essentially talking each other into a defeatist view of Australia. One might call Senator Walsh Pessimistic Pete, because basically Walshie is a fellow of a pessimistic frame of mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Walshie is my friend. I must say he occasionally tests the friendship, but he is my friend.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Walshie was going around in increasingly diminishing concentric circles ploughing his paddocks in bloody Doodlakine, he was working out ways to vent his spleen on the Country Party, which then became the National Party of Australia. So Walshie's whole reason for living and his whole reason for being in politics is to oppose conservatism, and particularly that conservatism represented by the Country Party, now the National Party, and the modern-day Liberal Party. For a long time it has been very hard to get Walshie to feel up-beat about anything, even when the economy has been going well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that Walshie has a mind set, and even facts will not get in his way if he wants to continue with a particular line of argument. I might say that what intrigues me about this debate is that it is about Walshie's bucket on One Nation. What surprises me is how long it took for Walshie to produce it. A week before One Nation was produced, before it was released to the public, Walshie said to me, `If you jokers don't reverse the Coronation Hill decision, I am going to bucket the economic statement'. That was before he had even seen it. He had decided he would judge it on the basis of one issue alone, and that was whether we reversed the Coronation Hill statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, `Well, Walshie, if that is what you want to do, far be it from me to try to stop you. If you want to take that judgment, if you want to say that this whole document, which is about restoring the Australian economy to growth, about trying to produce jobs for Australian workers, should be judged only on the question of Coronation Hill, then go for it. If that is what you want to do, if that is what you want to say about this Government, if that is what you want to say about your Party, and if that is what you want to say about the Prime Minister, well, do it'. I could not stop him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members ought to realise that Walshie's position on this was made up a week before he even read it. He said he was going to bucket it&mdash;and bucket it he has. But let us understand one thing about Walshie: he has never been able to avoid particular obsessions, and Coronation Hill is one of his obsessions. There are others I would just like to refer to. One might imagine for a moment why it was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Left Review</EMPHASIS>, the former organ of the Communist Party of Australia, that decided to carry Walshie in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is basically an issue about the accord. The communists have never liked the accord, the Liberals have never liked the accord, and Walshie has never liked the accord. So there is this trifecta of the communists, or what is left of them, Walshie and the Liberals. They are united on one view and one view only: that the accord is no good. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated, Walshie is entitled to that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt, however, whether the Leader of the Opposition is being entirely candid when he says he thinks the accord has been a failure as well. We only have to go back a few years to when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An accord is essential. . . The economic achilles heel of the Fraser Government (and of the Whitlam Government) was its failure to develop a viable and relevant wages and incomes policy of that sort.</PARA>
<PARA>This is Dr Hewson in his pre-leadership mode. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Liberals really need to recognise the wages area as their achilles heel and to come up with an alternative. At risk of being accused of heresy, might I suggest that it may be desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord-type agreement. . . </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Here is the Leader of the Opposition making these outrageous suggestions about the Prime Minister's veracity, calling him a liar whenever he can get away with it;  yet he is the one who is prepared to fashion any argument, any policy, to suit his purpose. A few years ago an accord was essential, not just for the Government, but for a Liberal government, and it was the absence of it that was the Achilles heel of the Fraser Government. One has to judge the Leader of the Opposition not just in terms of what he says today. We know that he will resort to anything in order to make a cheap political point. He will even rely on the organ of the Communist Party, or what is left of it, in order to substantiate his point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point here is that Peter Walsh has always doubted whether the accord would work. Walshie surprises me in this regard. This morning when I told him over the phone what I was going to say about his view, I said, `Walshie, if we had not had those tax cuts of which you now so strenuously complain, of which you used to complain, we would not have had the wages outcome we have had, we would not have been able to contain wages during a period of very strong growth and we would not now be seeing underlying inflation rates of between 3 and 4 per cent'. He did acknowledge that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once Walshie gets a bone&mdash;his bone was the accord and the tax cuts that we provided&mdash;it takes a long time to wrestle it from the grip of his vice-like jaws. Walshie has been wrestling with this bone notwithstanding the fact that the record is in, the runs are on the board, if you like, and the accord has been a great success for all Australia. Australia has never lived through a period of such strong growth without also having a wages explosion feeding into inflation and then having to grind down the economy on the basis of trying to snuff out the inflation induced by the wages growth. This is Walshie's view. Therefore, the Opposition has to be terribly careful about the way in which it decides to invoke Senator Walsh in support of its argument, regardless of the nature of the publication which decides to carry his views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make another point. The Leader of the Opposition started off by saying that the figures of which Peter Walsh complains do not come from a Treasury table. This is breathtaking. In the past month in here we have been hearing the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy blackguarding the Treasury, taking to bits the Treasury documents, saying that they are not worth the paper they are printed on; that they are produced by some group of propagandists in the Treasury building; that they cannot be relied on;  that they do not tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, on the flimsiest of evidence, those opposite say that because Peter Walsh says that a table is not a Treasury table it is not to be believed;  in other words, that if it were a Treasury document they would believe it. If we could convince those opposite that it was a Treasury document, they would then say that they did not believe it because it had been put together by that group of propagandists in the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Treasury puts together the forecast for the year out&mdash;the year immediately ahead&mdash;the Budget Papers for the year immediately ahead and the Forward Estimates of outlays only for a few years ahead. The Treasury does not, in the context of the normal budgetary process, put together years of forecasts for both sides of the Budget. But on this occasion we wanted to do that for the very good reason that we could demonstrate that, with the kind of growth that one can anticipate in Australia in the near future, we can provide a stimulus, get the Budget back to balance and at the same time deliver tax cuts that will produce a marginal rate of 30 per cent in that crucial area that has been focused on by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to do that, as the Prime Minister said, a group of officials, chaired by a Treasury official and including other officials from the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and econometricians from my office and from the Prime Minister's office, was tasked with this job of putting together these estimates. That was the purpose of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to take with handfuls of salt this new-found enthusiasm for Treasury authenticity on the part of the Opposition when it has for the past four weeks been misrepresenting the Treasury, quoting its documents out of context and abusing the authors of the documents on every occasion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did it once again. He quoted from a document and said that the Treasury had said that something would be a significant challenge, given that OECD growth averaged only 3 per cent in the 1980s. He was talking about the prospect of growing at 4 per cent during the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was quoting from was not a commentary on us; it was a commentary on him, a commentary on Fightback. What the Treasury said was that a significant challenge was producing growth rates of that order after the introduction of a tax change, after all the inflationary consequences of that and after the interest rate hike necessary to snuff the inflationary consequences of Fightback out of the system. Treasury was saying that under the Opposition we could not grow because of its wrong-headed policies, policies which are about high inflation, not low inflation;  about no growth, not growth;  about no employment, not strong employment growth of the kind that we are talking about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out of his own mouth, has condemned his own proposition by relying on Treasury documents which were a criticism of his proposals, not ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has been a bit of a joke in the sense that it has been all about what a Labor senator, a former Minister, has had to say about some of his own obsessions, gathered up over the years, from which he has never been able to relent. But he has more contemporary views, particularly about the Opposition. I just remind the Opposition what Senator Walsh had to say. The Prime Minister quoted him. He said that he has always opposed the idea of a GST type tax. He opposes it now, at the very least because its transition costs are high and because of the consequences for a big boost to the CPI and the way in which the Opposition would deal with that, by producing a credit squeeze and, therefore, a long term recession in this country. Those opposite can derive no comfort from the point of view of Senator Walsh on practically any issue. He is an enemy of the Liberal Party and, most particularly, an enemy of its economic policies, especially those relating to consumption taxes. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. These historic documents include three volumes of detailed responses by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to each of the Royal Commission's 339 recommendations. They include an overview supported by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers on behalf of their respective governments and a report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The First Step</EMPHASIS>, of initial consultations, carried out through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 May last year, I tabled the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I indicated then that it was one of the most significant Australian social documents of our time. The report painted a graphic picture of the lives and the deaths of 99 Aboriginal people and in so doing it showed us something of the harshness and alienation that characterise daily life for so many of the first Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the occasion of tabling the Royal Commission report, I spoke of the Royal Commission findings about the lives of those who had died in custody. These statistics provide a graphic insight into the lives of Aboriginal people and should be again placed on the public record. Of the 99 who died between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">88 were men and 11 were women;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Their approximate average age at death was 32;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">83 were unemployed at the date of their last detention;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary schooling;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">43 had been charged with an offence at or before age 15;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">43 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol. The Royal Commission concluded that in the remaining cases alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">The standard of health of the 99 varied from poor to very bad, with the average age of those dying from natural causes being a little over 30 years; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">63 of the deaths occurred in police custody, 33 in prison custody and 3 in juvenile detention facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over-represented in custody at a rate&mdash;calculated nationally&mdash;of 29 times that of the general community. In some States the rate is considerably higher and has escalated during the very time of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission found this grossly unacceptable, as does every fair-minded Australian and I believe every political party represented in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If non-Aboriginal people had been imprisoned at the same rate over the period of the Royal Commission and then died in custody at the same rate, over 8,500 non-Aboriginal people would have died. This comparison gives some idea of the enormity of the tragedy of wasted young Aboriginal lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Royal Commission found the most significant factor in this deeply disturbing over-representation was the `disadvantaged and unequal position' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all aspects of Australian society&mdash;social and economic. These conclusions impel governments to act to redress the disadvantage that is the fundamental cause of Aboriginal deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to say something to those most immediately affected&mdash;the families, relatives and friends of those who died in custody. I know that many of those people still feel grief, anger and irreparable loss. I understand their anguish that the Royal Commission did not find any death to be the result of deliberate unlawful violence or brutality. I know that for them this finding is difficult to accept. It may be of little comfort to them to read that the Royal Commission found that in many cases death was contributed to by systems failures or absence of due care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission, however, made a finding of much deeper significance. Those who died were not victims of isolated acts of violence or brutality. Rather, they were victims of entrenched and institutionalised racism and discrimination. Their deaths were the tragic consequence of two centuries of dispossession, dispersal and appalling disadvantage. That is an unpalatable finding, but one which must be tackled head on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a moral and political obligation on those in positions of political leadership, to bring about genuine, lasting change in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We must work so that the injustices documented by the Royal Commission become truly a thing of the past. I hope that every member of this Parliament supports the role of the Commonwealth in providing national leadership on this issue. The unanimous parliamentary support for the reconciliation process must now be further translated into ongoing action to give effect to the Royal Commission recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is proud to announce support for 338 of the 339 Royal Commission recommendations and will fund specific first stage initiatives which I will announce today. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has foreshadowed, the Government will make a second major announcement responding to the underlying issues highlighted by the Royal Commission within three months of today's tabling and I will later indicate the thrust of this response . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Royal Commission investigated the lives and deaths of those 99 men and women, 25 more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have died in custody. We also owe it to them to make a just, effective and sustained response to the report of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people and the wider Australian community are looking to all governments to ensure that we do not waste the historic opportunity presented by the Royal Commission report to deliver justice to Aboriginal people. As a result of this increase in public concern, governments around Australia have recognised the importance of working together on a national response to this unique national investigation. Each government designated a Minister to coordinate its response. These Ministers met as a joint ministerial forum and a Commonwealth-State-Territory working group of senior officials met regularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All mainland States and Territories have participated in the response by governments that I have tabled today. Following the recent election in Tasmania, that State Government has undertaken to examine its position as expeditiously as possible and no doubt its response will be the focus of considerable attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responses to the 339 recommendations contained in the documents I have tabled are not confined to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, nor were they ever intended to be so. The Royal Commission's recommendations involve an enormous range of Commonwealth, State and Territory responsibilities. Each Government has responded on a whole of government basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time of change in the relationship between Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the cooperation that has led to this response is an achievement of governments not to be dismissed even by the more cynical of public commentators. It is an achievement for the nation. Even more significant has been the involvement in this process of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, through nationwide consultations organised by ATSIC, and through the negotiation of the Commonwealth's response with the elected representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, ATSIC's Board of Commissioners, whom you, Mr Speaker, have so graciously acknowledged as being in the public gallery today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a coherent and comprehensive statement of government policy arising directly from negotiation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. At the Commonwealth level, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners approved all 339 of the Commonwealth responses following those nationwide consultations before they were approved by the Federal Cabinet. I am sure all members of the House will agree that this is a landmark in relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia. I thank the many members, from both sides of the House, who have come to witness the tabling of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to this process of negotiation and consultation in the development and delivery of all Commonwealth policies and programs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. This approach to our nation's relations with indigenous people underpins the process of reconciliation which was recognised by the Royal Commission as `the fundamental backdrop to reform and change in Aboriginal affairs'. As part of that process the Government has sought an ongoing national commitment to address Aboriginal disadvantage. As I have said, this is the key to reversing the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Royal Commission was established by the Commonwealth Government and the States and the Northern Territory with the support of the Federal Opposition, which I willingly acknowledge, and as the direct result of concern by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, so too the response by governments transcends boundaries of jurisdiction and political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission's report is of major significance for Australia's international human rights record. Internationally, Australia's human rights record is, I am proud to say, an open book. We are determined to maintain our commitment to ensuring the highest standards in our observance of human rights in Australia. Australia's accession to the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a very real demonstration of that commitment, as it provides an international right of appeal for all Australians on human rights issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the Human Rights Commission and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination are some of the international bodies vitally interested in the responses of Australian governments to the report. Amnesty International and other international non-government organisations will monitor the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. The declaration of 1993 as the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples also puts a spotlight on responses by governments to the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission confirmed that the principles of empowerment and self-determination are fundamental to change for Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission described the `pinpricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference' that confronts Aboriginal people every day of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aspire to control their lives and communities, in the same way that other Australians expect to control their lives and communities. It is for this reason that the Commonwealth seeks to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, and consistent with recommendation 192 of the Royal Commission, funding initiatives to respond to the Commission are directed towards Aboriginal community controlled organisations. This approach is supported by all States and Territories in their responses to the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such is the complex and comprehensive nature of the Royal Commission's report that the Government has decided on a two-stage approach to its response, which I have already referred to. I now turn to the detail of the first stage of that response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that responsibility for implementing the Royal Commission's detailed proposals for coronial, justice, police and custody reform lies largely with State and Territory governments does not mean that the Commonwealth will abdicate its very significant responsibilities in this very important area. Indeed, as I will outline, we intend to act on the basis of the Commonwealth's commitment to the national interest and our clear direct responsibilities for human rights, the Australian Federal Police and the provision of legal assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will also work to ensure essential Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement in criminal justice issues, operations and reform. An examination of the detailed documents I have tabled will show overwhelming support by all governments for the law and justice reforms recommended by the Royal Commission. I believe all governments want to turn that support into action. To facilitate this objective the Commonwealth will take a key role in the critical area of Aboriginal-police relations and will give further support to the initiatives already under way in the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn to the details of the Commonwealth's response on this issue, I want to make it clear that Governments are not singling out police for special criticism. As I said on the occasion of the tabling of the Royal Commission report 10 months ago, that report was not some police-bashing exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the police, like the rest of the community, have a range of attitudes and opinions. It is true that many non-Aboriginal Australians have a stereotyped view of Aboriginal people, values and culture. It is also true that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians are already working together to bust these baseless stereotypes and to improve community relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth, State and Territory governments intend to build on the valuable work already being done and to strive for a change in attitudes. We will also continue to insist on the highest operating standards for police and custody systems. Society will not and cannot tolerate anything less. The Commonwealth will set in train action to improve the operation of the courts, police and custody systems and to provide better legal services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is prepared to allocate $5m to the States and Territories to develop and enhance Aboriginal employment strategies in police services, custodial and court systems; the further training of police in awareness of Aboriginal history, culture and disadvantage; and to assist in implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission directed to improving Aboriginal-police relations. These resources will be allocated following consultation with State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now an agreed national agenda for reform and improvement in Aboriginal-police relations following the unanimous support of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments for the practical proposals for reform proposed by the Royal Commission in this area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will support and fund a national conference, involving Aboriginal community leaders and police, on Aboriginal-police relations.

These initiatives involve $1.97m over five years. We will continue initiatives already announced in the 1991-92 Budget. These include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission found that alcohol was a factor in the final detention of all of the 99 who died in custody. It is a major factor in family and community breakdown, domestic violence and unacceptably high incarceration rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Commonwealth will act now to support the efforts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves to defeat the devastation caused by alcohol and substance abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through ATSIC and in cooperation with the States and Territories we will provide resources for innovative, community-based action to prevent and counter alcohol and substance abuse, especially by young people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than $70m over five years will be provided for this purpose.

<PARA>A good illustration of the determination of Aboriginal people to tackle this major social issue is the Central Australian grog strategy developed by Aboriginal people themselves and which draws on models of treatment developed by Canadian Indians. Accurate data is essential for monitoring progress. The Commonwealth, through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, will carry out for the first time a national survey of Aboriginal people. The survey will complement information from the census and from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing needs and infrastructure survey and provide a much improved basis for policy and program decisions by governments and by Aboriginal organisations themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cooperation with the States and Territories, we will also support the continuation of data collection and analysis of deaths in custody by the Australian Institute of Criminology. The total cost of this first package of additional funding measures to tackle the immediate causes of deaths in custody is $150m over a five year period. The fact that three-quarters of this funding will be channelled to community controlled Aboriginal organisations through ATSIC is testimony to the Government's commitment to ATSIC as the vehicle for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander empowerment and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, the Royal Commission found that the fundamental cause of the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody is their unequal and disadvantaged place in Australian life. This is the second level at which deaths in custody must be tackled.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to simply change only law practice and criminal justice areas. We must also make a real attack on the economic and social disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments agree that the Royal Commission's recommendations constitute a charter for action in Aboriginal affairs for years to come.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second package will have a strong focus on economic development, self-reliance and self-sufficiency in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through measures which will produce sustained improvement in economic and social well-being. It should be stressed that if, as a result of these and other measures, the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal people can be reduced to the rate of non-Aboriginal imprisonment, in addition to saving human lives, there will be a saving to governments around this country of $80m per annum based on the current costs of maintaining a person in prison. It is an extraordinary statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second major initiative will require further intergovernmental cooperation. The Commonwealth has already given a commitment to high level and urgent discussions with State and Territory governments on the need for a national response to the underlying issues. To give effect to this commitment a Commonwealth delegation, led by officials of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, will initiate discussions on these issues over the coming weeks. Because of the importance of this second stage of the National Response to the Royal Commission and the necessity for cooperative government action, the Commonwealth believes that the underlying issues identified by the Royal Commission ought to be the subject of discussion at the forthcoming meeting of Heads of Government, as the Prime Minister foreshadowed some weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister also said&mdash;and I think this is put on the record with deep conviction&mdash;history will judge all governments on their response to the Royal Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achieving Greater Co-ordination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programs and Services</EMPHASIS> is a basis for further intergovernmental cooperation in redressing Aboriginal disadvantage. I reaffirm the Commonwealth's aim to continue to work within this agreed framework, although I acknowledge that it will take time for detailed arrangements to be put in place, again following extensive consultation and support by Aboriginal people for the initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the documents I have tabled show that governments have overwhelmingly supported the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Governments must be held to the undertakings detailed in their responses. This necessarily involves the creation of mechanisms for monitoring implementation. The Royal Commission emphasised effective monitoring arrangements. Indeed, they are the subject of its very first recommendation. The Commonwealth will fund ATSIC to carry out this monitoring role, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to coordinate Commonwealth monitoring arrangements and consultation with State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the moment this report was tabled, I have been determined to ensure the most open and comprehensive reporting of progress in implementing the Royal Commission's recommendations. I am also committed to involving this Parliament in that process. I am therefore pleased to announce that, at the Commonwealth level, there will be an annual consolidated report to parliament on the implementation of the Government's undertakings given in response to the Royal Commission recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC will be asked to give an account of the extent to which all Commonwealth agencies are meeting their obligations to give effect to Commonwealth support for the recommendations of the Royal Commission. I understand that the States and Territories intend to make similar arrangements. Cross-tabling arrangements in Commonwealth, State and Territory parliaments will ensure the greatest public access to this valuable information. If the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs supports the initiative, and the Parliament supports it, it will be my hope that that report could be referred to the parliamentary Committee on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will work with States and Territories to ensure that all relevant ministerial and senior officials' forums will give ongoing consideration to the progress of implementation of all Royal Commission recommendations falling within their spheres of interest, maintaining the commitment to the whole of government approach to the Royal Commission report. ATSIC's role will be complemented by an annual state of the nation report on the human rights situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be prepared by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Unit headed by a commissioner will be established within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to undertake that task. This annual state of the nation report assumes further importance because of the unanimous endorsement by the Commonwealth Parliament of the preamble of the legislation to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as an  essential element in the reconciliation process. The preamble makes the following commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from Governments at all levels to cooperate and to coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>The monitoring mechanism and data collection processes established in response to the Royal Commission will be of crucial importance in the preparation of the state of the nation report and will be supplemented by the extensive information already available to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. By providing the annual state of the nation report on Aboriginal social justice, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be acting as a watchdog over the nation in its achievement of the social justice objective of the process of reconciliation over the coming nine years leading to the centenary of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Royal Commission's support for the reconciliation process which it described as `the fundamental backdrop to reform and change' and for this reason wish to speak about the objectives of the reconciliation process and its integral relationship to government action to give effect to the Royal Commission response. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chaired by Mr Patrick Dodson, former Royal Commissioner, was appointed in 1991, following consultation and agreement with the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council will drive the process of reconciliation at the national level, backed by local and community based initiatives across the country. It will develop strategies for the reconciliation process, and will use the information in the annual state of the nation report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on Aboriginal human rights and social justice, as part of its obligation to foster an ongoing national commitment to redress Aboriginal disadvantage. In their responses to the Royal Commission all State and Territory governments have given their support to the process of reconciliation and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be seeking to initiate their active participation in this process over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the social justice objective I have already referred to, the process of reconciliation has two other important objectives which seek to keep faith absolutely with Aboriginal aspirations. First, the process seeks to promote an understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and of the need to redress that disadvantage. Second, as a part of the reconciliation process the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will consult with Aboriginal people and the wider community on whether the process of reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents and to make recommendations on the nature and content of any such document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has emphasised that this consultation process must not be rushed and that there are many important issues to be worked through with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. While the name of any document has yet to be determined there are far more complex and substantive issues to be addressed. The results of recent public opinion polls show that a very large majority of Australians support a document as one of the outcomes of the reconciliation process. The unanimous support of the Commonwealth Parliament for the process and now the support of State and Territory governments gives us time, as someone else said in December, to address these important public policy issues for our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude this statement by expressing the Government's and my own personal gratitude to the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, CBE, AM, and to the commissioners for their untiring efforts. All commissioners&mdash;and they are present today in the gallery&mdash;were involved in the community consultations and the negotiations which have shaped the Commonwealth's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Chairperson with commissioners Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon addressed the Cabinet before Ministers considered the submission on the Government's response&mdash;Aboriginal people speaking their minds to the highest decision-making body in the Government&mdash;was of great symbolic importance for this country. It reflected the seriousness of both the challenge and the task the Government and ATSIC face together. I cannot at this point do better than quote Commissioner Johnston in the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the first report I have just tabled relates to the proposed redevelopment by the CSIRO of its facilities at North Ryde, New South Wales. The main elements of the proposal are: a rationalisation and consolidation of the CSIRO accommodation at North Ryde; a progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land and up to 11 development lots to create a science and technology park; the retention of principal CSIRO buildings in good condition; and the provision for all of CSIRO's anticipated accommodation needs for the foreseeable future in existing buildings, upgraded as necessary, and state-of-the-art new buildings. The estimated out-turn cost of the work is $98m, to be funded from the sale and/or lease of surplus land at North Ryde.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that the standard of facilities at North Ryde restricts the continuing development of industrially significant research initiatives with a high national priority for the biotechnology, mining and minerals, energy exploration and food industries as well as work of major environmental significance. Each of the divisions at North Ryde plays a major role in providing research vital to its industry sector. These sectors represent major components of the Australian economy and include: coal, with exports of $6 billion; minerals, with exports of $16 billion; manufactured goods, with exports of $17 billion; and pharmaceutical and diagnostic products, currently imported at a cost of $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that the proposal proceed, the Committee has concluded that the development of a prestige science and technology park by the CSIRO at North Ryde is the most cost effective method available to it of providing the funds necessary for the development of high quality research facilities. As the proposal has been referred at a very advanced conceptual stage, the Committee has recommended that CSIRO provide it with detailed plans of each aspect of the proposal prior to the commencement of construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is also satisfied, following assurances from CSIRO, that adequate provision has been made for additional expansion of facilities at North Ryde should this be necessary in the future, and that the redevelopment strategy developed by CSIRO is realistic in current market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, there is one aspect of the proposal which the Committee believes should not remain at North Ryde but should be relocated to the Riverina region of New South Wales. I refer to the food research laboratory of the Division of Food Processing. The Committee believes that the food research laboratory can operate efficiently from the Riverina region as it has good transport links and an existing scientific base on which CSIRO could build. At the same time it would provide a stimulus to the scientific and industrial sectors in an important food growing and processing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee strongly disagrees with the working party set up to examine the future structure of the Division of Food Processing which rejected non-capital locations, with the professional needs of scientists being an overriding criteria. The Committee believes that CSIRO should be taking a national view when it examines such issues. In this situation it has a perfect opportunity to assist regional development, allow closer interaction with both food producers and processors and provide opportunities for contact with other scientists working in these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having considered the evidence presented by CSIRO and from the Riverina region, and taking into account the views of the sectional committee which visited the area, the Committee has recommended that the food research laboratory be transferred to the Riverina region and that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) do all within his power to ensure that that transfer takes place. The Committee has not recommended a particular site, although the sectional committee did inspect a number of sites adjacent to the Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga. The Committee believes that the question of a particular site should be a matter for discussion between the CSIRO and the relevant authorities in the Riverina region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria. This new building will provide up-to-date, climate controlled storage facilities for permanent value Commonwealth records in the custody of Archives in Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $6.5m at October 1991 prices. The Committee has recommended the construction of the proposed repository. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, permanent value Commonwealth records are stored in a former dry-cleaning factory in the suburb of Brighton. The Committee concluded, after inspecting the Brighton repository, that, if permanent value Commonwealth records remain stored there, many irreplaceable records will be lost. In fact, some have already been lost and others severely damaged. There is, therefore, an urgent need for Archives to be provided with a modern facility in which to store permanent value records in Victoria. Constructing a new repository at the existing site was considered impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an exhaustive site selection process for a new site, Archives settled on a site at East Burwood for the new repository. The site is eminently suited, being in a designated technology park and not excessively distant from Melbourne's central business district. A larger site could have been purchased but more distant from the main users of archival materials. The building itself will provide office accommodation, an area for conservation and a large storage area. The storage area will be on three levels. It will have a curved roof to accelerate water run off, an essential requirement for buildings of this type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the design is somewhat austere, it nevertheless reflects a need for functionality and a need for the building to be constructed of materials reflecting some cost-consciousness. The Committee questioned Archives about the ability of the building to be expanded. Archives advised the Committee that once all permanent value records are transferred to the new building, the building will have adequate capacity for another 10 to 12 years growth. If by then there is a need to expand further, the site is large enough for extensions to the building to be provided. These extensions will provide additional storage area for another 10 to 12 years. The building will be provided with a number of special features, including strengthened floors, special air-conditioning and fire protection measures. The need for these features was justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I would like to mention in conclusion is that the Committee questioned Archives about its involvement in the centenary of Federation. As honourable members will know, Archives is the custodian of an extensive collection of papers relating to Federation. Archives advised the Committee that it will be looking to increasing publicity about its activities and holdings of material relating to Federation which are in its custody. I am sure all honourable members will join me in supporting this nationally important endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report I have tabled relates to the installation of fire sprinklers at the international terminal building at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I should say at the outset that during its investigations the Committee took the view that this project should be examined on its merits and in isolation from issues relating to the third runway at Sydney Airport. Construction of the third runway was exempted from the scrutiny of the Committee, on the grounds of urgency, by the House on 14 November 1991&mdash;and we had something to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international terminal building was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Airport terminal buildings are not expressly covered by codes, but they need to have adequate protection. A number of fire hazard reports have recommended the installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety for the occupants of the building and to protect the property. Other improvements to provide smoke isolation, an emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits were recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Federal Airports Corporation assumed responsibility for Sydney Airport on 1 January 1988, additional fire exits have been constructed as part of a project which entailed a number of improvements to the international terminal building. These were completed in 1989. Smoke isolation measures have been substantially completed on existing stairwells and escalators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation has installed fire sprinklers in the international terminal complex at Sydney Airport, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1992. The design of this building was based on the assumption that the international terminal building would be upgraded by the provision of a sprinkler system so that a fire originating in the international terminal building would be contained within that building. The provision of a fire sprinkler system has been evaluated by the FAC as being necessary for the protection of the occupants and the building and to achieve Building Code of Australia compliance. The building is vast, and firefighting after detection has been evaluated as very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee has recommended that the work proceed, there are a number of issues in the report on which I should comment. The continued absence of a master plan for Sydney Airport is a matter of serious concern. In fact, in 1988, in reporting on the construction of the international terminal complex, the Committee recommended that the FAC prepare a master plan as expeditiously as possible to ensure the overall orderly development and operation of the airport. While the FAC has appointed a consultant to finalise the master plan, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) direct the FAC to complete the master plan as a matter of extreme urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that, in the absence of a master plan, the Committee is loath to recommend further work at Sydney Airport. In fact, it is my personal view that the Committee should not recommend any further work at Sydney Airport until a master plan is completed. However, as this project concerns an issue of public safety, the Committee has no option but to agree to the work proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is concerned about the cost of the project&mdash;$14.6m&mdash;and has recommended that the FAC review all aspects of the proposal in order to determine areas of possible cost savings. In relation to cost, the Committee has also recommended that the FAC commission a fire safety study to determine whether savings can be made in the provision of fire sprinklers. Evidence was given to the Committee which indicated that savings may be possible by limiting sprinklers to areas where they are required for life safety reasons or as cost-effective fire protection. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In speaking to this motion concerning the installation of fire sprinklers in the international terminal building at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, I would like, first of all, to commend the Joint Committee on Public Works for its diligence. It is obvious that it has been very thorough in looking at this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned, however, about some of the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). In particular, he mentioned that there is evidence that savings are to be made with the installation of these sprinklers. It seems that there are moves afoot to spend some $15m to upgrade the sprinkler system in the existing terminal. The Committee has now come forward with a recommendation that the work proceed, but has then added the caveat that there is evidence of some savings to be made. I feel that this is a matter of some concern and, frankly, it is a matter to which the Government ought to be made to respond and on which it should explain why those savings are not being examined further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to follow up on a couple of other points from the report. One involves the question of disability allowances which may be sought while these sprinklers are being installed. I understand that one of the unions involved is seeking a disability allowance of some $50 a day. Again, this raises a lot of questions, such as: who would be bearing the cost? Is $50 disability allowance a day a reasonable claim? I think we should have some answers. Who will have to pay it? Will it be the Australian Customs Service or the Federal Airports Corporation?  I think that before the work is to proceed, not after it has commenced, we should receive some answers to these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, I think all honourable members have vivid memories of what happened with the construction of this Parliament House and how there were some enormous blow-outs in costs because some of the unions involved used their muscle during the construction to exploit the situation to their own financial benefit. In fact, many honourable members would recall that the Federal coalition parties highlighted in their rorts report some of the worst extremes that went on during the construction of this place. It really was little short of a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note the point that the Chairman made about the need for a master plan for Mascot Airport. It seems extraordinary that despite the fact that the Federal Airports Corporation did promise this as long ago as 1988&mdash;some four years ago&mdash;we still have not seen it done. I think the Committee is to be commended for having emphasised this point. The fact that the Chairman has had to say that he believes it is a matter of `extreme urgency' that such a master plan be developed, highlights the fact that insufficient supervision is being given to this whole matter by this current Government. I believe if the Government continues to ignore that recommendation by the Committee, then further questions should be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this is a very important facility. We have a massive investment there. The Government's record to date has been one of some considerable embarrassment, not only to the Government but also to the nation, in the way the argument about the third runway has gone on and on&mdash;bearing in mind that the decision was taken as early as 1982 to build that third runway, but even today we still have not seen it built. I wonder whether this question of the master plan might be facing a similar delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, when one thinks about it, there are very large sums of money involved here. If there is no master plan it is hard to believe that every decision taken will necessarily be in the long term interests of improving that facility. For that reason and for many others, it should be, as the Chairman has pointed out, a matter of urgency; it should have been done some years ago and, clearly, the FAC should be brought to task over it and made to respond by putting together a master plan thoroughly, responsibly and in a professional manner. I commend the Committee again. With those questions, to which I trust we will receive some responses in due course, I leave my remarks there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;At the outset, I wish to acknowledge my strong support for the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works for the relocation of the food research laboratory to the Riverina region. The Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), accompanied by the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), and the Secretary, Mr Peter Roberts, visited Wagga Wagga in January as part of the Committee's inquiry into the redevelopment of the CSIRO facilities at North Ryde in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the Chairman and the other members of the Committee not only for their courtesy while they were in the Wagga Wagga area but also for the very thorough manner in which they investigated the matter and the consideration they gave to the representations. Obviously, I would like to congratulate them on their findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that overall redevelopment, the proposal was put forward that the CSIRO's food research laboratory might be relocated, to its advantage, in a rural area. With the support of the Wagga Wagga City Council, the Riverina Regional Development Board has been central to the bid to have the CSIRO division relocated in Wagga Wagga or another Riverina centre. However, it was considered that Wagga Wagga would be the most appropriate because of a site being available adjacent to the Charles Sturt University-Riverina campus. Other factors in favour of Wagga Wagga are that it is the centre of one of Australia's richest agricultural areas and has a significant food processing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in Wagga Wagga, the Committee took time to visit the university, where discussions took place with the Dean of the Faculty of Science and Agriculture, Professor Jim Pratley. The Committee also inspected the possible site for the Division of Food Processing as well as calling at the nearby Wagga Agriculture Research Institute. It also inspected the operations of Murrumbidgee Dairy Products together with the Murrumbidgee Flour Mill, which is a division of the Goodman Fielder group. There were also discussions with the Mayor of Wagga Wagga, Alderman Pat Brassil, and with representatives of the Riverina Regional Development Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a comprehensive coverage and, as reported at the time, the Committee members were impressed with what Wagga Wagga had to offer. They saw distinct advantages in the city as an agricultural centre as well as having Charles Sturt University, the Agriculture Research Institute and viable food processing industries. The proximity of the Horticultural Research Centre and the CSIRO Water Resources Division at Griffith was another advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the relocation of the CSIRO's Food Processing Division to a region with a strong agricultural industry makes sense because it offers real benefits to both the industry and the CSIRO. Such a move would strengthen the area's existing agricultural enterprises, provide for expansion and assist economic diversification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major consideration in favour of the Riverina proposal for the siting of the division is the substantial cost savings with the initial design and construction as well as ongoing savings compared with other options. Construction times will also be considerably reduced. Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration by the Government and the CSIRO is that Wagga Wagga is ideally located in the centre of the Murray-Darling basin food bowl. Some 125 processing companies are currently in operation in the Riverina area, and there is a developing trend for metropolitan plants to relocate to rural food growing centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most large metropolitan companies are multinational with overseas ownership, and there is a need to strengthen support for new Australian owned rural based companies in the national interest. Communications with Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne universities and research centres are easily provided from Wagga Wagga. Experience at Charles Sturt University and other organisations indicated that the Wagga Wagga environment was very attractive to professional staff. The city also provided good opportunities for employment, education and sporting and other social activities for staff and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has indicated that the decision on relocation will be made by the CSIRO Board and that he will have no say in it. I understand and I accept that bodies, particularly those that have statutory responsibilities, should, as far as practicable, be left to manage the instrumentalities for which they have been given responsibility, but I agree with the Committee and with what the Chairman of the Committee has said in this House this afternoon, that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that the recommendation of the Committee to relocate the food research laboratory to the Riverina region is approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also desirable that boards are made aware of owners' policies and objectives, and that is where the Minister comes in. That is what the Committee obviously had in mind when it said that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that this recommendation is approved. The Minister must make sure that the policies and objectives of the owner&mdash;in this case, the Australian Government&mdash;are well known to the board. In this instance, I would have thought it perfectly reasonable for the Government to convey a view to the CSIRO Board that, provided there are no significant financial or operational disadvantages to the CSIRO, it should relocate its food research laboratory in an appropriate rural region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government does not make such an assessment and advises the CSIRO of its view, then it must accept that it will be seen to be negligent in the discharge of its responsibilities to the taxpayers. Again, to borrow a phrase from the speech of the Chairman of the Committee, the Government itself should insist that the CSIRO take a national view. I have no doubt that the best long term benefits for the CSIRO would be achieved by relocating the Food Processing Division in the Wagga Wagga area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating my support for the recommendation of the Committee. I again thank the members of the Committee for their consideration of the representations and submissions that were made by people from Wagga Wagga, Griffith and other parts of the Riverina. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of food processing plants in the area, particularly in Wagga Wagga and out towards the MIA and the CIA, and I think it would be a natural move for the Division of Food Processing at North Ryde to move into the Riverina region. The Charles Sturt University would ensure that there could be scientific assistance for the CSIRO in that area. Earlier this week the Federal Government announced that the natural gas pipeline would be extended into the Riverina region through Leeton, Griffith and Narrandera, and of course that will have a further effect on the food processing industry in those areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, I wish to say that, since coming to office in March 1983, the Hawke and Keating governments have undertaken the most comprehensive overhaul of Australia's defence structure since Federation, commencing with the Dibb report in March 1987 through to June 1990 with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Defence Force and the Community</EMPHASIS> report and the May 1991 Force Structure Review. The Government has set in place a framework for a realistic and practical Defence Force structure in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Government's work, Australia can now look forward to the year 2000, to a Defence Force which will have the right equipment, the right training and logistic support, the right administrative framework and command structures to get the job done. Now that the macro aspects of the defence question have been dealt with, the Government has turned its attention to both modernising particular aspects of defence law and tidying up the administrative quirks which have survived in legislation over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House today is in some aspects a housekeeping Bill as it deals with a number of relatively minor matters. Those include the repeal of the obsolete provisions of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the amendment of the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 to enable the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) to be appointed to the Authority, and finetuning amendments to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, as honourable members would be well aware, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is far more than a housekeeping Bill because of the changes it proposes to the existing conscription laws. By any reckoning, conscription is an emotive subject in Australia as it has always been since an earlier Prime Minister, Mr Billy Hughes, first brought the issue to prominence in 1916. Certainly the publicity that has been generated in the media since the Government's intentions became known would support such a contention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my way of thinking it is easy to accept that a diversity of opinion would exist in the community regarding conscription. After all, we are dealing with a matter that, in common with a host of social issues, deals with the difficult question of an appropriate balance between the rights of an individual and our collective responsibility to our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, within its proposed plans to amend part IV of the Defence Act 1903, the Government has come up with a treatment of the issue of conscription which is both practical for the times we live in and yet responsive to any contingency which may arise. The measures are specifically that, firstly, there must be prior parliamentary approval for conscription; secondly, conscientious objection to particular wars, as well as to wars generally, would be allowed; thirdly, the expression `conscientious belief' would be defined; fourthly, there would be the provision of tribunals to consider claims of conscientious belief and for appeals from those tribunals; fifthly, there would be the removal of the current discriminatory provisions; and, lastly, there would be a call-up in the order of classes prescribed by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted the words of Opposition spokespeople and the wider opinion expressed in the press and on radio talkback shows that there is no real disagreement with the general thrust of the Government's plans. Frankly, it would be hard to believe that anybody could support a case for the introduction of conscription without parliamentary approval as the present legislation allows. Obviously in 1992 it is entirely inappropriate to have a law which forces the Parliament into the picture only after the publication of a conscription proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, it would be hard to believe that anyone would wish to see a continuation of the present judicial system proceedings which confront an individual claiming conscientious objection. How well many of us remember some of the distasteful cases which were battled out in the courts some years ago where, under the adversarial system, people were forced to answer horrific questions on what they would or would not do if confronted by acts of violence against their loved ones. Individuals were virtually forced to admit to cowardice or moral perversity to have their conscientious objection accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the adversarial system left little room for the acceptance of a point of view which was different from the mainstream or the possibility that a person could hold a strong moral conviction against a given war and yet not be a coward, intellectually disabled or a liar. It is the Government's intention to replace those judicial style proceedings with conscientious objection tribunals which would operate to determine the worthiness of an applicant's claim to conscientious objection. Unlike the old adversarial proceedings which acted without parliamentary guidance on what constitutes conscientious objection, the tribunals would follow set guidelines as laid out in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would imagine that there would be general agreement that the Parliament, rather than the judiciary, should be the body to determine what our society will accept as a basis for conscientious objection. Under the Bill, the definition of a person's conscientious belief is that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)is likely to be of a long standing nature.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the absence of adversarial proceedings, the Government has ensured that the onus of proof must lie with the applicant. This is only reasonable as we are dealing with cases which could only occur, as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said in his speech on the subject, `during a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia'. Such is the threshold for conscription which exists under the present Act and which would be maintained in the new Bill&mdash;that is, under circumstances where one could confidently predict that the mainstream Australian community would support all reasonable measures to defend our continent. In other words, in circumstances where it would be appropriate for anybody who believed he conscientiously could not fight in defence of his homeland to prove the basis of that conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian example, tribunals have become a very effective way of dealing with issues not suited to adversarial proceedings. Veterans have generally found that the Veterans Review Tribunal has worked effectively to gauge community liability in the case of war caused disabilities and the Administration Appeals Tribunal has been a useful forum for different groups of people who had need to challenge government department decisions. It is the Government's intention that people whose cases were lost before a conscientious objectors tribunal would be able to take their case to the Administration Appeals Tribunal, thus giving the individual the appropriate reserve opportunity to present his or her case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the Opposition has two particular grievances with the legislation as it stands: firstly, it is not happy with the requirement that parliament must approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect; and, secondly, the Opposition cannot rest comfortably with the concept of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, rather than war in general.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the first of these two points is concerned, I believe that the Opposition's concerns are understandable, but largely irrelevant in the real world. The fact is that conscription would only ever be used as a last-ditch measure to defend our shores. Although we can talk about different scenarios which could arise and which may, theoretically, limit our strategies because of the requirement for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>parliament to approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect, the reality is that both our government and our people would be well aware of the prospective problem before it arose. It is inconceivable to imagine that Australians would not rally to the cause where Australia was under threat, as it is inconceivable to imagine that our government of the time would not be taking appropriate logistical, administrative and military steps well ahead before conscription would need to be contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that without a time limit the whole exercise of giving parliamentary conscription controls could become a useless charade. This Government wants to ensure that parliament considers conscription on a case by case basis. That can only be done by setting a time limit. A time that would be suitable for those purposes is 90 days. It is a short enough time to ensure that parliament is addressing the circumstances of a given conflict, yet it is long enough to grant flexibility in the case of rapidly escalating contingencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the Opposition's second point of dispute to this legislation, I believe it is a pity that acceptance of neither genuine objection to a particular conflict cannot be recognised, nor the important legal principle of human rights which underpins the concept. The Government took its lead in the matter from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which, in its 1985 report, unanimously recommended that conscientious objection by a particular conflict should be an accepted part of our legal framework. Acceptance of the Committee's recommendation has been government policy since 5 December 1986. In broad terms the Committee resolved that it was possible for a person's sense of personal integrity to be violated by compulsion to participate in one armed conflict, but not necessarily another. The Committee, in paragraph 2.15 of its report, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conscientious belief involves a seriously based conviction which is part of the core fundamental values of a person and which is expressed as an imperative having primacy in the life of the person concerned. To be coerced by law into acting in a way contrary to this imperative would be to experience a violation of one's integrity as a human being.</PARA>
<PARA>Over recent weeks we have heard a great deal of negative comment from some members of the Opposition regarding this aspect of the Bill. We have heard that people will be able to claim political belief as a reasonable ground for conscientious objection; we have heard that the provision is a sop to multicultural interests in Australia; and we have been told that the floodgates will be opened to those who will dodge combatant service by claiming a deep-seated aversion to a given conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's shadow Minister for defence in this House, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his speech on the matter has also said that conscientious objection to a particular conflict could only exist on a political basis if that person could commit to another conflict. All of this, of course, is incorrect. The shadow Minister has demonstrated, in my view, a very regrettable lack of ability to think laterally. If he cannot think of an instance where an individual might hold a strong and lasting moral aversion to a given conflict which may not be present in another conflict, I have badly overestimated his lateral thinking processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice it to say that I do not feel the necessity to outline examples to defend my position. The fact is that people claiming conscientious objection status will need to satisfy the firm definitions which will be laid down in the Bill. A cursory appraisal of those definitions by any fair-minded person would show that political inclination would hardly satisfy a tribunal of proof of conscientious objector status, nor indeed would ethnic background. We must remember that not only need the objectors' beliefs be fundamental in their conviction of right or wrong, they must be likely to be of a longstanding nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is a pity that the Opposition has not supported the Government on this issue, if only because there is an important principle at stake. The reality of a direct threat to Australia&mdash;if I know the Australian public&mdash;is that support for our defence would be overwhelming. I can assure honourable members that there would be no queue of people claiming conscientious objector status, nor would there be any problem with those who have come to Australia over the course of the last generation or two, and it is stupid to suggest that there would be. Australians have a proud history of support for their country when the chips are down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition has missed is that the fundamental significance of this legislation lies in the Parliament's recognition of the principle of conscientious objection in particular conflicts. This principle cannot be applied to particular categories of conflicts, such as whether we are talking about defence of our homeland or forward action. But, like all tenets of law, it must stand or fall as a general principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a nation which supports the rule of law and the fundamental tenets of human rights, we can do no less than be consistent in our approach. If we believe that it is possible to conscientiously object to one conflict but not to another&mdash;as the Government does and the Senate Committee did in 1985&mdash;then we must support a law that recognises and deals with such a contingency. The Government has put together a Bill which sensibly deals with the difficult issue of conscription. It is a Bill which follows a long line of similarly sensible and practical Bills in the defence arena of this Government, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that in this regard the proposals contained within the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 relate to circumstances which may arise only during times of war. In the context of the Defence Act, `time of war' is defined as any time during which war actually exists, including the period between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war and the actual declaration of war. `War' is defined as:</PARA>

The Act also provides for priorities to be determined in regard to the calling up of persons within these specific categories; for example, younger men have a higher priority than males in the 45 to 60 age group. These provisions are inappropriate and inadequate as they no longer reflect present day realities or requirements. </PARA>

Modern warfare and its complementary strategies are very different from those utilised in all the previous conflicts in which Australia has been involved, perhaps with the exception of the Gulf war.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports both the proposal to determine conscription classes and categories by regulation and the proposal to repeal the discriminatory elements in the existing Defence Act. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill proposes some major changes in relation to conscientious objection to compulsory military service, including providing a clearer and more comprehensive definition of the term `conscientious belief', establishing a person's right to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation, clarifying the distinction between exemption from service with the ADF and exemption from duties of a combatant nature, and the establishment and provision for operational guidelines of new tribunals to determine claims for exemption from combatant or non-combatant duties on the grounds of conscientious objection and provision for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system. These elements of the Bill are largely based on the recommendations of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the meaning of conscientious belief, the Bill seeks to extend and clarify the existing definition by repealing section 61(2) of the Defence Act and, instead, providing:</PARA>

The Bill further provides that a conscientious objector, whilst still being liable to serve in the defence forces, has the right to seek exemption from combatant duties. The coalition supports this right. We also support those elements of the Bill relating to the establishment and operation of conscientious objection tribunals. However, the coalition is opposed to the proposal contained within this Bill which provides for a person to claim exemption from compulsory military service on the grounds of conscientious objection to specific conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 2 of the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service</EMPHASIS>, the introductory paragraphs canvass the complex issues which arise when the rights of an individual person may appear to clash with the rights of the community in which he or she lives. The report not only identifies this possible area of conflict between individual and state but also discusses both the right of individuals to act in accordance with their conscience and the right of the community to defend itself from threats to its existence. The report also recognises the particular obligations of a government in this regard including, if necessary, the supplementing of regular defence forces by means of conscription. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand, there is the right of the community simply to exist, and, moreover, to exist with political structures freely determined by its citizens. The national community has the right to defend itself if such existence is threatened, and the government is obliged to ensure that the right is secured for the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government may discharge its obligation by the waging of formally declared war or by entering upon some other form of military operation. The Commonwealth Government may consider that the fulfilment of its obligations requires that the military forces which can be raised by voluntary enlistment, be supplemented by conscription.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, there is the right of the individual person to act in accordance with conscientiously held beliefs. This right requires that a person not be compelled by law to act contrary to a conscientiously held position such that, so to act would fundamentally impair his sense of integrity as a human being.</PARA>
<PARA>The report acknowledges the long term acceptance by this Parliament of the principle of conscientious objection, and the need to provide exemption from compulsory military service for the people whose conscientious beliefs do not allow participation in any form of military service in any armed conflict. It also acknowledges this Parliament's recognition of the need to provide exemption from compulsory combatant duties for those whose conscientious beliefs may allow them to engage in non-combatant military service, as distinct from combatant duties, in any armed conflict. The report then proposes the introduction of a whole new category of conscientious objectors&mdash;those who object to engaging in a particular armed conflict but who may not necessarily have the same objection to participating in some other armed conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report describes any person holding a conscientious objection to military or combatant service in any armed conflict as a person holding an `absolute' conscientious belief. Those holding a conscientious objection to military or combatant service in a particular armed conflict are described as persons holding a `specific' conscientious belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arriving at its definitions, the Committee placed considerable weight on the analysis of conscientious belief provided by Professor Peter Singer. Professor Singer stated in his evidence to the Committee that in his view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the only possible definition of a conscientious belief is a belief based on a seriously held moral conviction. That is, of course, very broad and it is perhaps best understood if we see what it leaves out. What it leaves out most clearly are beliefs based on selfish desires of one sort or another, personal interest, beliefs based on emotions like fear or ambition perhaps. It also leaves out beliefs which are whimsical or based on impulse.</PARA>
<PARA>He then argued his belief:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs, then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I can certainly appreciate the fine line the professor is attempting to draw in his argument, I do not believe it is a realistic or practical assessment of the facts as they apply in relation to armed conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had 25 years experience in the defence forces, and I have yet to come across a war where innocent civilians have not suffered or died. Neither do I know of any war which has been successfully confined to attacks on military targets. Terrible as it undoubtedly is, wars inevitably involve more than military personnel, and even with the latest available technology, and the best will in the world, bombs or missiles will inevitably land off target or be directed to the wrong target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from other considerations, there is the dark grey area of what actually constitutes a specific conscientious belief, as compared, for example, with political dissent or opinion. The Senate Committee's report acknowledges some of the difficulties which may arise in this regard. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formation of a specific conscientious belief will commonly involve an interaction between the fundamental values of a person and his assessment of current history and politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on we find the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee hopes that its analysis of the distinction between the basis or ground of a belief and the belief itself may be helpful to those who fear that partisan political stance may masquerade as, or be substituted for, conscientious belief in such a way as to go far beyond the present provision so as to create a whole new set of relationships between individuals and their democratically-elected government.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, much of the philosophical argument presented in the Committee's report only serves to reinforce this fear. It is a fear which was very clearly explained and very forcefully expressed to the Committee in evidence which was given by the then National Secretary of the RSL, Mr Ian Gollings. In his evidence, Mr Gollings said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gollings also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because it is impossible to separate armed conflicts from the political context in which they arise, even defence against a direct threat to Australia, the exemptions for conscientious belief must be limited only to those genuine cases where individuals cannot accept the moral obligation for combatant service even in defence of their homeland.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gollings explained that the RSL recognises and supports the right of individuals to hold valid and sincere conscientious beliefs against military service. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, objections to political decisions requiring participation in armed conflict cannot be tolerated as an exemption without causing incalculable harm to the national will and the defence capability. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find it difficult to determine just what an individual would state as his grounds for objection to participation in a particular war unless they were of a political nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand fully objections on moral or religious or ethical grounds to participation in a war on the basis of being a combatant or not, but find it difficult to see how moral or ethical or religious grounds could be used to prevent an individual from being able to participate in a particular war because of the political nature of warfare, warfare being an extension of government. It must come back to the political question.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, whilst readily acknowledging the concerns expressed by Mr Gollings, did not agree that specific conscientious belief will always be another way of describing mere political dissent. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Something more than political dissent is required; if the stance of the individual never gets beyond political opposition, then it should not be recognised as having the extra dimension which justifies the description `conscientiously held belief'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee agrees that if a political attitude is to be described as a `conscientiously held belief' then it must go beyond mere adherence to a `party line'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In practical terms, it is very difficult to see how such a fine distinction could be made, especially given the wider definition which is proposed for the term `conscientious belief'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscientious objection has always been a complex issue. I do not believe&mdash;and neither do my coalition colleagues&mdash;that workable provisions can be included in the Act, or implemented in fact, which would adequately or appropriately address the possibility of specific conscientious beliefs. There are just too many unknowns to be considered and covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the recognition of a conscientious objection to a particular war, as distinct from war in general, is a basically flawed concept. Either one has a conscientious objection to war or one does not. The broader definition of `conscientious objection' proposed in this Bill certainly provides a much wider scope for the recognition of what constitutes a genuine conscientious belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria are worth repeating. It must be a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations. It must be so compelling in character for the person concerned is duty bound to espouse it and it is likely to be of a longstanding nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A belief is not a true belief just because it is useful at the time, and a conscientious objection can quite readily fall into the same category. In fact, it is sometimes very difficult to differentiate between conscience and self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real danger that a clause permitting conscientious objection to particular conflicts would result in a deluge of claims for exemptions. It must also be remembered that the provisions contained within this Bill relating to compulsory military service would only apply during a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia; they do not apply to commitments for forces overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the amended Act would allow conscription only for the direct defence of Australia, the clause regarding conscientious objection to particular wars means Australian citizens could argue against their commitment and responsibility to defend their own country, whilst at the same time maintaining they would be willing to fight in overseas conflicts. Such a scenario is quite unacceptable. I would therefore urge the Government&mdash;and others who may be considering their support for this amendment&mdash;to rethink the ramifications of the specific conflicts clause. If the amendment regarding specific conflicts is passed, Australia will be the only country in the world to have legislated for a right of exemption to those who hold a conscientious objection to participation in a particular war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of the 90-day rule and the provision relating to the conscientious objection to particular conflicts, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill has some very sensible and worthwhile provisions. Therefore, the Opposition intends to support its passage through the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is a very important, and in some ways historic, piece of legislation. Today has been a very interesting day in the Parliament; the statement on Aboriginal deaths in custody was delivered and now we are debating this legislation. Although the events have been treated as low-key by the media, both of them are very important in terms of the rights of Australians. They are issues which have affected Australians over many years. In Australia's history there have been a great deal of battles, debates and conflict over conscription. Just as we have had to wrestle with the questions concerning the Aboriginal people over the years, we have had to wrestle with the question of conscription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), raised a number of philosophical issues. There is a sense of deja vu because the argument that he has presented here today about objection to or having a conscientious belief in respect of particular wars was the very argument that was presented during the Vietnam war, when again his side of politics led the nation into a war situation which it claimed at that time was very much in the interests of the defence of the nation. Of course, nobody claims that now, looking at the outcome of the Vietnam war and the way events have unfolded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, those opposite were arguing against the idea that one could have a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. There was a very serious conflict in the community in relation to that matter. They legislated on the basis that if people were going to have a conscientious objection, it would be on the basis of some kind of religious or very fundamental conscientious belief. When people went before courts to have this belief tested, they were asked ridiculous questions such as, `Would you defend your own children if they were under attack?'&mdash;nonsense which should not be part of this kind of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an analogy drawn between that and a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war even though it had nothing to do with the security or interests of Australia and was being promulgated, as Professor Singer makes clear in his comment, in a very dirty way&mdash;unfortunately, also by the side of the Allies. Therefore, in that context, it was possible for someone to conscientiously object to that war, but it was not allowed under Australian law at that time. A number of people, including a number of courageous young people who were conscripted, preferred to go to gaol to going to the Vietnam war because they had a conscientious belief against that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing a similar situation. It is not exactly the same, because, fortunately, as has been pointed out&mdash;and I commend both Ministers responsible, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), for the fact that this is in the legislation&mdash;we will not have any conscription unless it is based on a direct attack on Australia. That is the first point that has to be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that we will never again need to have the sort of debates we have had in this country over a number of periods in its history when we have sent young men off to fight in wars which, in retrospect, have been very hard to justify, especially the First World War. The more Australia comes to grips with and understands its history, the more it will understand the disgraceful situation in which so many young Australians went to fight in a war that had so little to do with the interests of Australia&mdash;and were slaughtered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we receive more evidence, we see they were sent to the slaughter in very bad military judgments. It is not an episode that we can be proud of. There certainly were gallant and brave people in the fighting, but the military nature of that exercise was foolish. The political goals of that war, especially in terms of the interests of Australia, are increasingly coming under question. I predict that as Australia evolves in its history there will be more and more questioning of that war, just as there is of our participation in the Vietnam war. Therefore, the issue of conscientious objection to particular wars is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if we are going to have conscription legislation, the two aspects that have been brought in by the Government will be very important. The first concerns the question of there having to be a direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be conscripting young people to fight in wars that have nothing to do with a direct threat to this nation. That will be a very important aspect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect concerns conscientious objection to particular wars. Admittedly, by the introduction of the clause that provides that we can have conscription only in the event of a direct attack on Australia, much of the heat is taken out of the argument. That is very important. The other aspect that is very important is that there are still circumstances in which it is possible for individuals to have genuine conscientious beliefs about particular conflicts and particular wars, even in the context of a direct attack on Australia. In that situation, I believe the matter needs to be looked at. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking about this very important legislation concerning conscription and the historical context in which we have to see it. I commend the Minister for bringing in this legislation which will now require parliamentary approval for conscription of any forces within Australia in the future. It is very important legislation; in fact, if we look at the context of what has occurred in Australian history with respect to the conscription issue, it is historic legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was making some comments about the fact that the Opposition is always opposed to this idea of conscientious objection to particular wars, which it was during the time of the Vietnam war. A number of people were thrown in prison because they had conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. Now that we have this legislation, lo and behold, the Opposition says yes, it will support the legislation, but it is going to oppose the clause which deals with conscientious objection to particular conflicts and particular wars. This goes to show that Opposition members learn nothing from history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was commenting before, if we look at some of the wars in the history of Australia which the conservatives have brought us into, we will see that young people have had to go off and be slaughtered in wars that have had very little to do with fighting for the national interests of this country and very little to do with the political interests of this country, Unfortunately, we have had slaughter&mdash;I use the term advisedly&mdash;especially with respect to the First World War, where so many young people were slaughtered in a war that really had very little to do with Australia or its interests. We ought to learn something from the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been drafted very carefully. It was based on a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which recommended a course  along these lines. I think we should pursue this legislation again, because we never know what may happen in the future. We have now limited the right of conscription. It will now involve a direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be able to conscript young people to go off and fight the wars just because it may be in the political interests of some government, in the future, to send people to fight that war. Firstly, conscription will have to do with a direct attack on Australia; and, secondly, it will allow for narrow, but genuine, conscientious objection on the basis of a particular war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Professor Singer and others have argued, that is a very valid, philosophical concept which we ought to be proud to be putting through as legislation. I hope that the Minister will resist the calls from the Opposition about this amendment and that we will proceed with this clause so that at least we can do what this Labor Party has always done, that is, to lead this nation in both time of peace and time of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members opposite that we were prepared to give away half of Australia when their predecessors were in government. It was only with the Curtin Government coming into power that we were able to start to defend this country, and we were not going to give up an inch of our soil. So we have a proud record on defence matters. At the same time, we also have a proud record on defence matters with Labor Party leaders, such as the great Prime Minister Curtin and later on Prime Minister Chifley, who were able to lead this nation in time of war and in time of peace. At the same time, we allow for genuine conscientious objection for people who have that belief. We certainly do not want people being conscripted to fight in foreign wars that have nothing to do with the interests of this nation, which has been the unfortunate record of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This omnibus Bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, covers three broad areas. Firstly, it introduces legislation dealing with technical amendments to five Acts: the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, or DFRB;  the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987; the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. Secondly, it repeals the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973. As a number of speakers have said previously, it substantially revises part IV of the Defence Act 1903 dealing with conscription and conscientious objection in relation to compulsory military service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition line has already been put forward. There is no problem from our part with the first two of those areas, and we agree with much of the third area. But we will be moving some amendments in the committee stage, particularly in relation to clauses 7 and 9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the specifics of the first two areas of the Bill, a number of provisions in the DFRB 1948 Act are now obsolete, given that the scheme closed in 1972. Amendments in this Bill repeal the obsolete provisions which deal predominantly with fund contributions. The Defence Force superannuation legislation amendment of 1991 amended the DFRDB Act to enable the deputy of the chairman of the Authority to preside at meetings in the absence of the chairman, and take precedence over the deputy chairman. Subsection 14(3) of that Act, which enables a quorum to be made up of the chairman or deputy chairman and two or more members, requires amendment so that a quorum may also be made up of the deputy to the chairman and two or more members. An amendment in this Bill provides for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 extends the appointments by the Governor-General to the Authority to include the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) as the fourth member of the Defence Force in that forum. This move reflects a change, of course, in the Australian Defence Force higher structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority Act which establishes a home loans assistance scheme for members of the Defence Force makes special provisions for incapacitated persons. The current definition in section 3 covers incapacitated persons who are discharged because of a compensable disability on or after the commencing day, 21 January 1991. An unintended consequence of this is that some incapacitated persons who joined the Defence Force after 14 May 1985, the cut-off point for eligibility under the old defence service homes scheme, and were discharged before 21 January 1991, are not covered by either the old or the new scheme. This Bill amends section 3 to ensure that the definition `incapacitated person' includes persons who are not currently covered by either scheme. The Bill also amends section 4 of the principal Act so that incapacitated persons who are affected by the amended definition have two years to exercise their entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to have an entitlement to a home loan under the Act, a member must be issued with an entitlement certificate. Section 13 enables certificates to be cancelled where they are found to be issued as a result of false or misleading statements or where entitlement did not exist. However, there is no provision to vary or reissue certificates in order to correct errors or omissions. The proposed amendment in this Bill will enable the Secretary to the Department of Defence who issues certificates to vary or reissue them effective from the time the original certificate was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 47 of the Military Superannuation Benefits Act 1991 personally indemnifies the trustees of the board of trustees, the Commissioner of Superannuation and the staff assisting the Commissioner from any action, liability claim or demand arising from a bona fide performance of their duties or functions. These amendments extend the indemnity provisions to cover an acting trustee, a member of an incapacity classification committee and a member of a reconsideration advisory committee. Notwithstanding these amendments, the corporate liability of the board as a whole is retained. The Opposition supports all of these technical, albeit unexceptional, amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the National Service Act aspects, the 1951 National Service Act provided for registration and compulsory military conscription into the armed forces. The 1973 National Service Termination Act nullified it, but the Whitlam Government did not repeal the 1951 Act so as to preserve the entitlements of those who served under the terms of that Act. The Bill before us preserves legislative provisions where it is necessary to protect entitlements accrued through rendering national service. Importantly, repealing the 1951 Act precludes the option of implementing conscription. The capacity to order this is legislated for, as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) said before me, in the Defence Act 1903. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us proposes to alter the Defence Act 1903 with regard to national service in three ways: it requires prior parliamentary approval for conscription; it removes discriminatory provisions from the 1903 Act; it removes from the 1903 Act the subsection defining specific classes of people who can and cannot be conscripted. It also establishes that classes of people conscripted will be determined by regulation rather than by the Defence Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to conscription. Section 60(1) of the Defence Act enables the Government to introduce conscription for service in the Defence Force in time of war via a proclamation by the Governor-General. Of course, `war' is defined under section 4(1) of the Act as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by an enemy or armed force.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before us amends the Defence Act to require prior approval of a proclamation by resolution of each House of parliament within the period of 90 days before the proclamation comes into effect. While this amendment will give parliament the necessary power of veto over an executive proposal to establish conscription, it has the potential, in the Opposition's view&mdash;this point being made very strongly last night by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I quote him&mdash;`to hamstring the Australian Defence Force further' because of this 90-day rule. I do not intend to say any more about that at this stage. That will be covered in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On existing discrimination provisions, the present Defence Act includes clauses limiting conscription to male, British citizens and, of course, excludes Aboriginal Australians from service. This Bill repeals these sections, leaving the requirement that conscripts have been resident in Australia for at least six months and be between the ages of 18 and 60. The honourable member for Groom, as does the honourable member for Casey, falls into that same category. Of course, the Opposition supports this move away from discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On conscientious objection, this Bill deals with it in the following terms: it defines more clearly the term `conscientious belief'; it establishes the right for a person to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation&mdash;I will have more to say about that later&mdash;it clarifies the distinction between exemption for service in the ADF and exemption from duties of a combatant nature; it establishes new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; it provides guidelines for the operation of these tribunals; and it provides for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill seeks to add greater definitional clarity to the term `conscientious belief' by repealing the present provisions and by adding the requisite factors of a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; so compelling in nature for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it. It is likely to be of a long-standing nature. Although still very wide in scope, this definition is useful in as much as it provides some criteria for assessing the validity of a claim to conscientious objection. The Bill also adds a new section to the Act, section 61(CV), which places the onus of proof on the applicant to demonstrate that objections to service are genuinely founded on conscientious beliefs. The Opposition agrees generally with this rationale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the second important point with which the Opposition disagrees and on which a number of previous speakers have had a few words to say. I refer to a  conscientious objection to a particular war. The present Defence Act provides for conscientious objection only in so far as these values are applied to military service in all wars at all times. The Bill proposes to change that by making the following addition to section 61(A)(1)(i) of the Act specifying exemptions for persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in a particular war or warlike operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Government's argument, an individual with specific conscientious objections to a particular war should be excluded from military service, providing those objections are based on fundamental convictions rather than particular political objections to the conflict. The merits of this approach were discussed, as a number of speakers have mentioned, by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1985 report. That Committee noted in part the RSL's objections to the proposal that conscientious objection could be applied exclusively to participation in a specific conflict but not to participation in all conflicts. As war is a political instrument, the RSL argued, distinctions between objections to service based on fundamental convictions as opposed to simple political objections to service could not be made in practice. The Committee unfortunately rejected the RSL position, saying that `something more than political dissent is required'. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the stance of the individual never gets beyond political opposition, then it should not be recognised as  . . . conscientiously held belief.</PARA>
<PARA>In practical terms, it is difficult to see how such a distinction could be made, especially given the wide definition which has been applied to the term `conscientious belief'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) had to say there is, in my view and in the view of the Opposition, a danger that the existence of a clause permitting conscientious objection to specific conflicts would result in a flood of claims for exemptions. Given that the Bill defines `conscious belief' very broadly and that the Defence Act allows for conscription only for the direct defence of Australia but not for the commitment of forces overseas, the clause allowing for objection to specific wars is opposed by the Opposition. At the very least, the clause raises questions about whether it is acceptable to legislate so that citizens can refuse to defend their own country at the same time as maintaining that they would be prepared to fight in other conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) made the comment in this place last evening that, in their view, it was one in, all in. They also applied one fundamental test which I think was a point missed very badly by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his contribution to this debate earlier. That point&mdash;that fundamental test&mdash;is loyalty to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to questions about the legislation which were highlighted in an article by Bernard Lagan which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 March. It is headed `Choose your war: a new deal for conscripts' and in it, in part, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new grounds for conscientious objection would allow people to avoid military service if they objected to a particular war&mdash;but not all armed conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change, according to the Government, would recognise that an individual's sense of personal integrity might be violated by a compulsion to go to a particular war, but not all wars.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Opposition... would oppose the change because it gives too much opportunity for people to seek to avoid compulsory military service on political grounds, rather than because of their fundamental moral beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly in relation to this Bill, the present Defence Act specifies classes of citizens with a view to determining the priority with which they can be called up. For example, class I comprises unmarried males between 18 and 35 years; and class V, males between 45 and 60 years. It allows for a proclamation to further divide the classes into smaller age groups, but specifies that a call-up would have to observe the age order specified in the classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill repeals this and leaves it to subordinate legislation to establish a series of classes of persons for call-up. The purpose is to give greater freedom of action with regard to determining what categories of people can in fact be called up. This is a worthwhile objective because the classes outlined in the Defence Act unnecessarily constrain the Executive's flexibility to determine the order and priorities of conscription. In a modern war, the aim of conscription may be directed at recruiting specific skills into the Defence Force, rather than the mobilisation of a mass army. The present Defence Act provisions are therefore inappropriate to present-day requirements. On this basis, the Opposition supports this view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having watched and listened to this debate last evening, I noted that there was a very large degree of indulgence on the part of both the Chair and the Minister at the table. I hope that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is presently at the table, will exercise that indulgence tonight because I would like to stray a little from this Bill and make one or two other points in the defence environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two matters refer to discrimination. In the first instance, I refer specifically to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation matters. I know that the Minister will say that it is not a matter for him or for the Department of Defence; it is a matter for the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the legal processes. But I say to the Minister that a lot of ex-<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> survivors are suffering very badly at the moment. Some of them are being constrained, in my view, unreasonably by the legal processes and, indeed, by the inconsistency of those processes. I refer specifically to a case which was before the Supreme Court in Victoria where the Commonwealth has now sought leave to appeal, whereas it has not in a couple of other cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister at the table to please take this matter to the Attorney-General and see whether we can do something in 1992 to get these compensation cases cleared and cleared quickly. I have had a number of calls to my office in the last couple of weeks and one person in particular was near-suicidal. That is not being extreme. I know that it is getting outside the Minister's sphere of influence, but I am saying that this is discrimination on the part of the Government. It is up to the Minister, as a Minister of the Government, to take that on board and I ask that he do that. </PARA>

One of the benefits of having this close contact with a section of the defence forces is that it affords one the opportunity of keeping abreast of the effects of policy decisions on service life, especially the legislative decisions that are made in this national Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the privilege of being able to reflect on my own experience in the services during my period of national service in 1953 and subsequently as a member of the Sydney University CMF regiment. They were enjoyable times, and the lessons I learned from those experiences have held me in good stead ever since. I acknowledge the excellence of the training and the character building that took place in my own life during those periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking on this Bill, I would like to focus my comments on those areas that amend existing conscription laws. In particular, I will be speaking on clause 9(d), which amends section 61A of the principal Act and relates to conscientious objection. Before I move on to those specifics, I wish to take this opportunity to make some general comments regarding the whole question of conscription. As I mentioned previously, I have had first-hand knowledge of conscription and, although I look upon that experience as a very positive time in my life, I also appreciate that many people do not look upon it in such a favourable light. It is a very emotive issue, especially when we are engaged in military conflict, and the public reaction during the recent Gulf war bears testimony to that. Certainly, we all remember the reaction to conscripts being sent to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that on 22 January 1991 the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) when speaking on the Middle East ministerial statement made the observation that, for his electorate, the matter of conscription needed urgent clarification. He remarked that the Vietnam experience, even after 25 years, was still fresh in the minds of our people&mdash;and, indeed, it was and is. Although the Whitlam Government repealed the National Service Act of 1973, there is obviously still a great deal of public concern regarding the possibility of future governments committing themselves to a program of conscription. I was interested to note fairly recent support for peacetime conscription by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fisher) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), although it must be said that they were speaking independently of their parties in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party made some very good points in favour of peacetime conscription. In an article by Glenn Milne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 January 1991, he was reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it would give them (i.e. conscripts) an opportunity for character building, team-work, cohesion, motivation and a wide range of activities which flow from the military service or indeed peace corps or community service.</PARA>
<PARA>His remarks were them complemented by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro when, in a media release dated 28 October 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Nation desperately needs to be stimulated with a young generation of disciplined, motivated and unified young people. We need to develop leadership skills, a sense of pride in our Country and an attitude that we must all contribute to the prosperity and future of our Country.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) also made a few interesting remarks with regard to his belief in the need for certain kinds of conscription and their re-introduction, and they were mentioned in his speech last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military service can play a tremendously helpful role in developing in our young people qualities that will stay with them through their adult life. However, my research leads me to believe that, apart from anything else, the cost of such a program is quite prohibitive, especially in times of recession. The Leader of the National Party made this point back in January 1991, and the same is true today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to put in a plug to the Minister about the need for him and Senator Ray to look very hard at the call from a lot of schools, for example, for the reintroduction of cadet training. In my own electorate, at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains I have one of the healthiest and largest cadet units in the country. There are over 75 members in that cadet corps with a waiting list at one stage, I believe, of almost 100. It is not attached to a school but is just a cadet unit being run in that town, where it is flourishing. In Penrith, we have similar excellent cadet units that are run extremely well. It is always a great pleasure for me to go their graduation ceremonies. I am very proud of the young people who are there and who receive the awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend people like Ollie Hume, who is one of the driving forces in the Katoomba unit in terms of providing the very qualities that we were talking about earlier. The Leader of the National Party referred to the qualities that develop in young people as a result of doing their national service, and the same qualities result from the experience of younger people in the cadets. It is not conscription; it is all on a voluntary basis. I commend that to the Minister. I would love to see him in my electorate on some occasion just to encourage the citizens who are involved, and the young people in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the point of the prohibitive costs, my figures are based on updated figures prepared in 1986 by the defence group of the research service in the Parliamentary Library. They are very interesting indeed. Based on the assumptions that for a one-year engagement all 18-year-old males are eligible, 50 per cent of those examined by a doctor will be rejected as unfit for service, conscripts will be paid the same rate of pay, and women are not involved, we find that about 52,500 of 18-year-old men would be conscripted in each year of the scheme. As the bottom salary of the bottom ranking grade of private soldier in the Army is $19,281 per annum and associated living and training costs would inflate this to around $39,000 per man, this would yield a personnel cost of about $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore reluctantly have to agree that it does not take long to see how prohibitive the costs would be if this were to be introduced. This is without taking into consideration the fact that the ratio of conscripts to regulars is 1 : 3, which would mean that we would need a Regular Army of about 153,000 just to cope with the training program. Then we would need to build new accommodation and training facilities, buy additional equipment and allow for the additional costs to administer and enforce the scheme. In light of the amendments contained in this legislation that repeal the discriminatory elements of the principal Act, the financial impact of conscripting both male and female would be substantially increased over and above what has already been stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from this very brief overview that it would be just not possible to consider conscription unless there were extreme circumstances. It also reinforces the need to develop our existing defence forces to the point that we are afforded reasonable protection without resorting to conscription. Unfortunately, we do not have that sort of protection now, irrespective of what claims might be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gulf war has highlighted some real limitations of our defence capabilities. The fact is that our defence forces as they stand at the moment are too small for sustainable, credible operations. The winter 1991 edition of the national journal of the Australian Defence Association states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a defence statement that provides long term sustainable strategies. It is sheer common sense. I am not speaking from the point of view of a warmonger; honourable members realise that nobody is more peace loving than the honourable member for Macquarie. We only have to stand back and look at the evidence, the whole situation. If we look at the Dibb report, the White Paper or whatever, we cannot help but agree that we need long term sustainable strategies that are well and truly funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition firmly believes that six well manned battalions is the very minimum Australia can afford to have if it hopes to be able to respond at short notice to any low level conflict that may occur in our region, especially in the north. We are engaged in a very successful Kangaroo 92 operation in conjunction with many of our friends, but it is still true to say that we need a large injection into our own systems, our own defence forces, in order to give more confidence to our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, if the Government is honest with itself it will admit that the majority of problems confronting the reserves today are as a result of inadequate financial support. Within the reserves we have a fine team of dedicated men and women who are committed to serving this country. However, they are becoming increasingly frustrated by a lack of equipment, resources and training facilities. We need to reverse this situation and provide these men and women with interesting and intelligently defined missions for them to perform. I sympathise with the Minister concerning budgetary constraints, but that excuse is really not good enough. In 1986, in a speech in this House, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not justified, to describe peace and stability in Australia's region as precarious. There are a number of existent and latent sources of conflict and instability, including economic development problems such as food, resource, energy and employment shortages; internal, ethnic and religious conflicts; problems of leadership succession; conflicting territorial claims; long standing national enmities and border conflicts; resource and marketing competition; massive increases in military competition and the introduction of advanced military technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed. We still live in a region of the globe that is filled with uncertainties. Although the Soviet Union no longer exists as a threat, the Warsaw Pact has dissolved and there has been some very encouraging progress in the area of nuclear disarmament, it would be naive and foolish to become complacent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our greatest need right now is a new 1992 White Paper that will bring us totally up to date with our present regional situation and our ability to meet any perceived defence needs. Senator Durack recently said in a paper on the coalition's priorities for defence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1987 White Paper was a product of its times&mdash;times which have now passed.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, we cannot rely on quick and decisive action from our allies. The Gulf situation bears testimony to that. Let us just reflect on what happened there. When Kuwait was invaded every possible avenue of diplomacy was exhausted before any military action was taken. It was only after meetings were held, ultimatums were given and, finally, many months later when the world community was convinced that military action was the only option, that Kuwait was finally and decisively liberated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ask ourselves: what would happen if Australia found itself in a regional conflict?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House makes some changes that will alter current legislation should we need to take such extreme action. As I mentioned earlier, I want to specifically comment on clause 9(d) which amends section 61A of the principal Act and relates to conscientious objection. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause adds exemptions for persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in war or warlike operations, or in a particular war or warlike operations. . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principal Act gives no option, and rightly so. It is ludicrous to suggest that one could decide whether to object purely on the basis of who Australia is in conflict with. According to the Government's argument, an individual with specific conscientious objections to a particular war should be excluded from military service, provided the objections are based on fundamental convictions rather than particular political objections to the conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is, however, separating fundamental objections from political objections. Given the wide definition which is applied to the term `conscientious belief', it is particularly difficult to see how one could make the distinction. Under the terms of this amendment, we could find that some citizens may refuse to defend their own country while at the same time maintain that they are prepared to fight in other conflicts. In conclusion, I join my coalition colleagues in opposing any amendments which apply the right to conscientious objection to specific conflicts, rather than to a general opposition to conflict. </PARA>

I am a very worried person. I appreciate the reason for the Government bringing in amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally I would not respond to the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), but I was in the House this afternoon when he said various things, which undoubtedly proved to me that he and the Left of the Labor Party have brought a lot of pressure to bear upon the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in the drawing up of the legislation which was done with the support of the Australian Democrats. We undoubtedly see the story that they have been able to get across. This concerned me, and I made a note of one or two things the honourable member for Calwell mentioned. He emphasised the fact, and this is very true within the legislation, that conscription will only take place in very extreme circumstances. I do not disagree with that as I think that is quite correct. He said that if Australia was attacked, then we would conscript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calwell also referred to the First World War and the Second World War. He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only a week or so ago, virtually attacked the fact that we sent troops away in the First World War and the Second World War. I hope the time never arrives when our country is not prepared to go to war, even overseas, on a mission that will eventually protect Australia. This has been the case. We were prepared to send an expeditionary force overseas to protect our free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many young men and women died in the conflicts concerned. But if they had their days over, I bet that the great majority, if not all, of those involved in the conflicts would do the very same thing again. We benefit today because in those days Australia was prepared to do those things. We should be prepared to go offshore to defend the freedoms that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calwell referred to this. Let us look at the last war, when the Americans came to our shores. Irrespective of the fact that he said the coalition parties were prepared to let a portion of Australia go&mdash;we may have had to, notwithstanding the party in power&mdash;the fact of the matter is that the Americans were one force that came here and helped to resolve the Pacific war. In doing so, those people defended the shores of Australia.  We can never be prepared to forget these things in the history of Australia. History repeats itself time and time again over the decades and the centuries. Unfortunately, as far as wars are concerned, we have to be prepared. Only tonight, as I heard on the news, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), I think it was, remarked that North Korea will soon have nuclear arms and, as he pointed out, this is a threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the legislation before the House will not cover these responsibilities. I think it will, but let us be reasonable about it. Let us be in the mood, as Australians have been in the past, when discussing the legislation to say that we are prepared to meet these realities when they come to bear on us. At the moment there is a thaw in world affairs. The Warsaw Pact has now disappeared, as has the NATO Alliance. They have passed and they are something of the past. But, as I said earlier, at times we find that history repeats itself. We have to be prepared to react at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A while ago I mentioned the cadets. I favour national service very much. I know that this may not be directly associated with the Bill before the House, but there is a connection. I favour it for different reasons. I do not favour conscription unless it is totally necessary to defend our homeland, but I favour national service for many reasons. I have seen it in action overseas. I have seen the qualities of young men and women develop because of the discipline and the service they have been able to undertake. I believe it would be a wonderful thing if we could afford to have national service in this country. The honourable member for Macquarie was quite correct in what he said earlier, that it would cost over $2 billion to bring in national service. That is something we cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I was approached the other day by an elector of mine, whom I felt was very convincing. He suggested to me&mdash;he placed it on paper&mdash;a scheme that he believed would be very useful as a form of national training in Australia. His name was Hobbs, and he comes from the Taree district. He served in the Army for most of his life. He was a warrant officer class 1, and is now retired and living on a farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has suggested a two-year scheme whereby young people who are unable to get work, who are unable to get an apprenticeship, could on a voluntary basis go into some form of military training. Incorporated in this training would be an apprenticeship of some kind, which I believe is commonsense. He has gone to all the trouble of pointing out a complete scheme. A person could be trained to be a member of the police force, a carpenter or an engineer. Over the two years he or she would receive at least one year of Army training and for the other year would be involved in some apprenticeship training to equip that person to enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is a sensible scheme and one that many young people would like to participate in. I am sure they have no objection to military training. At the same time they are learning to be useful within the community. I say to Mr Hobbs that I will place his suggestion before the Minister for Defence and also the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Minister to see whether such a scheme can be accepted. Most of the people who would be involved in this are receiving unemployment relief at this time. If they were involved in the scheme, they would naturally receive the wage they are supposed to receive. This is a practical scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day we see young people walking our streets who would welcome this. Most young Australians are good. Ninety-nine per cent of our young people, if given the opportunity, would be happy to be involved in some scheme where they could be useful to their country by defending it, going in for discipline of some kind, learning how to do a job. We are wasting a great deal of the unemployment relief that we are paying to young people today. It is certainly keeping them, but as far as they and this nation are concerned it is going down the drain. We are teaching them hardly anything. We are not teaching them a thing. I have confidence in these young people. I believe that when they leave school they will be prepared to enter something like this. It would not be conscription;  it would be voluntary and it would be useful for them to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the Bill before the House. I agree with all of the utterances of the members of the Opposition who have spoken on this legislation. We broadly agree with the Bill. There are facts about it that have been fully explained here. It seems to me that 90 days after the proclamation is a long time. I think that is in clause 60 of the Bill. I would also say to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) that on many of these matters we can never overrule&mdash;I do not believe that it is time to do so;  I am not averting to that&mdash;the chiefs of staff of our defence forces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Throsby says, it was a wide-ranging debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to a number of the members who took part in the debate&mdash;the honourable members for Mayo (Mr Downer), Gilmore (Mr Sharp), Chifley (Mr Price), Fowler (Mr Grace), Calwell (Dr Theophanous), McPherson (Mr Bradford), Macquarie (Mr Webster), Groom (Mr Taylor), Casey (Mr Halverson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and, finally, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan)&mdash;who have all, in their own way, made a contribution to the matters that are before us in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of those matters have not attracted much attention, but they did attract support. I will just refer briefly to them. They are, first of all, the provisions of the Bill which do not relate to conscientious objection, those which amend the Defence Housing Authority Act to enable the Defence Force Assistant Chief of Personnel to be appointed to the authority. I think that was referred to by one or two speakers, notably the honourable member for Groom. Next are the amendments which are referred to as finetuning amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1900, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. They are totally uncontentious provisions. Thirdly are the provisions of the Bill which repeal obsolete provisions of the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948. All of those were supported by all speakers who referred to them and did not attract much debate at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Similarly, there are a number of provisions in the part of the Bill which deals with conscription that seemed to meet with general approbation. They are the provisions which repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973; the provisions which require prior parliamentary approval for conscription&mdash;though the question of the 90 days did attract a certain amount of attention, and I will return to that; and the provisions which define the expression `conscientious belief'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;which, I suppose we could say, inspired this Bill&mdash;gave a good deal of attention to how to define a conscientious belief, and I think that from all sides of the House there was agreement that it was right to set out what it is that constitutes conscientious belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another provision which met with approbation is the provision that tribunals shall be set up to consider claims by individuals that they held a conscientious belief, a conscientious objection to war. Again, in the past, as the House would know, tests of conscientious belief have had to be made before courts in an adversarial atmosphere and not in the way that this Bill provides. It is unlikely, of course, that those tribunals will ever be set up, but I believe it is proper that they work in the way described by the Bill and that they have the option&mdash;and indeed the obligation&mdash;when finding in favour of a person who claims a conscientious objection to war or to a particular war, to compel that individual to take part in non-combat service rather than in combat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the legislation which repeal the present discriminatory provisions&mdash;those which discriminate against women, Aboriginals, and non-Australian residents, and make them all equally liable for call-up in the event of conscription&mdash;attracted general support in the debate. That is a matter of satisfaction to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, the provision which allows for call-up in an order of classes as prescribed by regulation attracted favourable comment. It is the case that in future wars we may very well not have a requirement for a mass mobilisation, divisions and divisions of infantry, but rather will need the ability to conscript persons of particular skills, of particular talents and from particular classes. Again, that provision was generally approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That leaves a couple of contentious matters. Of those, the one that by far and away attracted the most debate was the provision that would allow conscientious objection to particular wars as well as to wars generally. I am aware that this will be the subject of an amendment moved by the Opposition, so I may as well indicate some of the Government's views about that matter now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with particular care to the remarks of those who addressed this issue in what was a very interesting debate. I thought, if I might say so, that the honourable member for Casey participated in the debate in a very thoughtful way when he recited from and reflected upon chapter 2 of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on this matter. Might I recommend it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it makes very good reading in its discussion on the rights of the community, which has to continue to exist in the way the community determines, on the one hand with political structures freely determined by its citizens and, on the other, with the right of individual persons to act in accordance with their conscientiously held beliefs. That is a right, of course, which has always been recognised in our kind of society and it goes back a very long way to our roots in the United Kingdom. I notice that the honourable member for Mayo sighs at this, but it is something that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are things which are at the root of a liberal society and which I believe this legislation takes account of. On this question of a particular war, I thought I might quote from the evidence of Professor Peter Singer to the Committee. He argues in favour of the possibility of conscientious objection to a particular war. In his evidence he said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war. If we do not do that we are simply making an arbitrary distinction between two forms of conscientious belief which are equally conscientious.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote is from page 9 of the Committee's report. It was argued by a number of witnesses before that Committee that conscientious belief had to be against all war in general or not at all. I believe that a number of speakers shared that point of view in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Committee concluded, and I am quoting from page 11 of the report at point 2.23:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is crucial to recognise that an individual's perception of what threatens his integrity may have as many starting points or catalysts as there are genuinely human concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This point is likely to be particularly important when specific conscientious belief is in issue.</PARA>
<PARA>It defines `specific conscientious belief' as conscientious objection to a particular war, and it says further:</PARA>

This is again from the report of the Committee. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Returned Services League of Australia (R.S.L) found it well nigh impossible to distinguish specific conscientious belief from political dissent. The R.S.L. view was put most forcefully by the National Secretary, Mr Ian Gollings:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gollings goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We find it difficult to determine just what an individual would state as his grounds for objection to participation in a particular war unless they were of a political nature.</PARA>
<PARA>So the RSL had real difficulty&mdash;and one can appreciate it&mdash;in distinguishing what circumstances might arise which would lead an individual to take conscientious objection to a particular war or conflict but not to others. The Committee rejected that view and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament should add to its present recognition of absolute conscientious belief, recognition of specific conscientious belief so as to grant exemption from participation in a particular military conflict where to be compelled by law to do so would violate the individual's sense of personal integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill should be redrafted so that it indicates neither an exemplary nor exhaustive list of grounds for the conscientious belief.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it will not give examples, nor does the Bill; and it will not set out an exhaustive list of grounds, nor does the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I might help the House if I said that I could be persuaded that somebody might, say, object specifically to participation in an invasion of Australia where he or she were called up, where the front line of the enemy consisted of women or, indeed, as we have seen in wars recently in the Middle East, where the front line consisted of 14-year-old children. A person, particularly a woman who was called up, for example, might say, `Look, I do not object to defending my country; I have no conscientious objection to war in general; but I cannot bring myself to participate on grounds of moral conscience in this particular war where I am called on to shoot or kill people of my own sex'. That may not be a belief that appeals to the honourable member for Mayo, or to other members in this House, but I can see that the possibility could arise and I can see that it would be a moral objection, a conscientious objection. There could be similar instances in a particular war which had to be pursued by means which an individual found horrific, perhaps the use of particular weapons&mdash;napalm, as has happened in the past, or something of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the occasions when a person would argue that they did not object to being called up for a war in general but for a specific war would be rare. As the RSL has said, they are difficult to imagine, but I believe they are imaginable, and I believe that it is right for this legislation to allow for that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which attracted debate was the question of the 90-day limit. I believe there was a great deal of misunderstanding about this provision. Certainly, the right honourable member for New England appeared to believe that the legislation required that one had to wait 90 days before the Parliament could consider this question. That is a misunderstanding. The legislation provides that the approval must be given within 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of the Committee, the reason for that was that, if there was an unlimited time, the relevance of the approval to the particular conflict would be lost. In other words, if we could approve in 1992 a blanket approval for conscription in the event of a conflict and that were not, as it were, brought into effect until 1995, the relevance of parliament approving that conscription for that conflict would be entirely lost&mdash;it would be a blanket approval and not one specific to the circumstances. It is a pretty simple point. Otherwise, it would mean that the situation would be a charade. That is the reason the 90 days is there. I must say that I am not entirely clear what the objection to it is, unless it is purely a misunderstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I have commented on the main points that were raised during the debate. I conclude by thanking honourable members for what were thoughtful contributions to the debate. I leave out of account those remarks which were well and truly outside the scope of the debate. The honourable member for Macquarie, for example, referred to defence expenditures in Australia and regarded them as too low. I raised by way of interjection how then the coalition proposed to lessen those expenditures. He instanced the example of Senegal&mdash;that was the only example he gave&mdash;as a country which we should attempt to emulate in our defence expenditures. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the provisions in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill for a proclamation to be laid before each House of the Parliament in relation to conscription, but not more than 90 days before the day on which it is expressed to come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a major matter. The reason the coalition has decided to move this fairly technical amendment is not, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) suggested, that we are somehow confused about it, but because we believe in these matters that it is extremely important to retain as much flexibility as is possible. With all of these defence issues flexibility really lies at the key of any successful defence undertaking. That applies to conscription as much as it applies to issues such as equipment or what happens to regular forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By imposing the 90-day provision so that the Parliament has to give its approval no more than 90 days before the proclamation for conscription actually comes into effect&mdash;it is not very likely that it would arise as a problem&mdash;the Government is limiting the flexibility of the Parliament and the Executive to put conscription into place over what might be necessarily a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot anticipate the circumstances in which conscription would be required at all because I am not anticipating an imminent invasion of Australia, but one never knows the circumstances in which it would take place if it should ever happen. In those circumstances, I think the wiser course of action is to retain flexibility. That is the reason the Opposition is moving those two amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the feeling that the Opposition's heart was not in these amendments and that has been confirmed. A fundamental assumption that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs made when it reported was that Parliament should approve conscription when it became necessary to do so&mdash;not years beforehand or many months beforehand.

<PARA>These amendments relate to conscientious objection in a particular war, a matter on which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) spoke at some length. In addressing this issue, I want to make a few remarks in response to what the Minister said about this issue in summing up the second reading stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that conscription can be objected to on the basis of a conscientious belief, which perhaps would be of a religious or some other nature. One can understand the circumstances in which that could happen. In other words, it would be a conscientious belief based on objection to the whole concept of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a particular war, I think it has to be said that we on this side of the House very strongly agree with the proposition that was put to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, from which the Minister quoted at some length, that if there is to be an objection to any particular war, that objection is going to be little short of a political objection and there is not going to be a great deal more to it than that. As the Minister found when he tried to examine examples in which one could object on a conscientious basis to participating in a particular war, it is very hard to imagine circumstances in which that objection could be anything but political, and he conceded that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to us that people may object for religious reasons. This was not raised by the Minister. For example, Australia could be subject to an invasion by a Muslim country or a Muslim group and Muslims within Australia may take the view that they would not wish to fight against brother Muslims. That underlines this whole question of the test of loyalty to Australia. The fundamental loyalty of citizens of this country must be a loyalty to this country. It is not something that is divisible. A fundamental component of political philosophy in so-called Anglo-Saxon countries for many a century has been the indivisibility of the sovereignty of the country and the loyalty of its citizens to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the sixteenth century and the debate about the reformation and the decision by Henry VIII to sever the ties with Rome&mdash;as I am sure your recollection would, Mr Deputy Chairman; of course, there was much more to that issue than there is to this one&mdash;we see that one of the arguments that was promoted by those in favour of the separation from Rome was that citizens had a loyalty to their own nation and to their colleagues within that nation, their fellow people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the very same argument, we on this side of the House do not believe that loyalty to Australia is something that should be divisible. If this country is subject to invasion, other than having some quite rare conscientious objection to doing anything whatsoever to participate in any kind of military activity, Australian citizens have an obligation if called up under conscription to make a contribution to the protection of this country, not to leave it to others and not to have a divisible view of loyalty to Australia. That is really why we object to this part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister used a couple of examples which, frankly, I thought confirmed our argument completely. He gave one example of what would happen if the front line of the enemy were women and people decided that they would not be prepared to fight against women. If Australia was subject to this sort of Amazon invasion that the Minister apparently has in mind and large numbers of Australians decided they would not fight against women, what would that tell a potential enemy? The way to invade Australia is with a force of women. It is a quite fatuous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister uses the example of 14-year-old teenagers being in the front line of an invading force. The argument is exactly the same. If we as a country, more generally, were to take the view that we would not fight and defend our country against women&mdash;a very sexist view and one that I would have thought the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would wish to examine&mdash;or against people who, admittedly, by the standards of our civilisation, were under-age to participate in a war, we would be throwing open our whole country. We are simply saying that all an enemy needs to do is to put together a particular composition of an attacking force and it can have what it likes. I must admit that that is quite an extraordinary proposition for the Minister to have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He raised a third example, which I think came from Professor Singer, whom he quoted as one of the people who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which has been much quoted in the context of this debate. I am not sure whether I am right, but I think he was quoting Professor Singer in this case. He said that people may decide not to participate in a war because Australia had decided to attack civilian targets rather than military targets, or that there was some concoction of our defence strategy in defence of our nation which they felt uncomfortable about. Again it leaves open the field to anybody who wishes to invade Australia to confuse issues in relation to the types of targets that could be attacked, thereby making the country all the more vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on the point that we believe that this issue is about nationhood and loyalty to Australia. It does not sit comfortably with the latest craze in the Labor Party&mdash;one which doubtless will pass fairly soon&mdash;to say, `We're more nationalistic than you on the other side of the House'. It is a very funny sort of concept. It is the latest craze for Government members, on the one hand, to argue that and, on the other hand, to argue that loyalty to this country is something which is effectively divisible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we are moving these amendments. We believe that the majority of members of this House would support these amendments if they were given a free vote to do so. I must admit that I would be very disappointed, in the face of the arguments that I have put to the Minister tonight, if he did not change his stubborn mind on this issue and support these amendments which are being put forward by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The disappointment is all mine. It really is an unhappy thing for a fellow South Australian to be as obtuse and unable to appreciate the arguments that I have put forward, particularly someone who has been trained at university. It is pretty clear that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has not read chapter 2 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. He puts the argument for the indivisibility of loyalty in a nation. He says that this has been very much a part of the tradition of countries such as ours for some centuries. He is right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, a part of the tradition of countries such as ours is the individuality of conscience. It is not for the state to say to a person, `You may not believe such and so because loyalty demands otherwise of you'. It has always been part of the tradition of dissent of a liberal democracy that conscience is individual. It does not matter whether or not I agree, whether the honourable member for Mayo agrees, or whether this entire chamber agrees as to whether such a proposition is persuasive or not. If an individual person says and sustains in the way that this legislation proposes, as a matter of conscientious belief, that he or she may not do something because it will offend his or her conscience, that is his or her right. That may be sustained in respect of war, in general, just as much as it may be sustained in respect of a particular conflict. Let me repeat what the definition of conscientious belief is in this legislation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person is taken to have a conscientious belief in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) is likely to be of a long standing nature.</PARA>
<PARA>These cannot be trivial beliefs; they cannot be frivolous beliefs; they cannot be beliefs which have been arrived at the day before. They must be very deeply held. It may be impossible for the honourable member for Mayo to imagine that somewhere in Australia there is a person who cannot bring himself, as a matter of conscience, to engage in a war in which he may directly have to kill a woman or he may directly have to kill a child. But I can imagine it. This legislation encompasses the possibility of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an enemy were predicating his strategy in attacking Australia on what he supposes the conscientious beliefs of numbers of Australians will be, I think that would be a pretty silly enemy to start with. I think the numbers of people who would exercise the conscientious belief to a war in general, or much less so to a particular war, would be minuscule. Bear in mind that in the Vietnam war&mdash;the most divisive war politically, socially and, dare I say, morally in this society in my lifetime&mdash;only one in about 1,000 of those who were called up claimed the right of conscientious objection. So the numbers that would be likely to be involved in the event of a direct or apprehended attack on Australia would not just be minuscule, they would be completely and utterly negligible. It is to make a Mount Everest out of an anthill for the honourable member for Mayo to construct the kind of objection to it that he does in moving the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I respond to the remarks that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) made. He presupposes that the number of conscientious objectors to an individual or a particular war&mdash;to use the language of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;would be negligible on the evidence that there were only one in a thousand conscientious objectors in the case of the Vietnam war. I would have to say that the provision for conscientious objection in the case of a particular war&mdash;that is the case of the Vietnam war in this example&mdash;did not exist. If it had existed&mdash;one does not know&mdash;those figures could have been substantially higher. It may not be of great concern to us today whether the numbers were higher, lower or whatever they may have been. We would all have views about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that in the event of a particular war, there would conceivably be&mdash;and I say conceivably be, but we have to take this into account when considering legislation&mdash;a large number of people who would find a way of exercising a conscientious objection to that particular war. Why do I say that? I say it for two reasons. People do not want to be at war. I am sure that I am no exception. I am sure that I am not one Australian out of 17 million in saying that the last thing I want to do as a human being is to go to war. One of the reasons that I do not want to go to war is that I do not want to be shot at or shot. I would have to say that it is also true of me and my fellow country men and women that we do not want to kill people; we do not want to kill children, as the Minister put it; we do not want to kill 14-year-olds; we do not want to kill women. But I am not so sexist as to say&mdash;and I am sure that most people would agree with this&mdash;that we would perhaps enjoy killing men just ever so slightly more than we would enjoy killing women. It is a fatuous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that people do not want to go to war; they do not want to kill, and that is understandable and typical. But in the case of the country being subject to an invasion, there would be a percentage of the population that would rather get out of the gruesome task of defending our country and simply leave it to others. I find it hard to believe that any Australian would want to see his country invaded and taken over by a foreign power. But there is probably a proportion of the population that would be quite happy to leave the gruesome task of defending our country to other people. That has, of course, happened in past conflicts&mdash;not just in relation to this country, but in relation to many countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscription is an unhappy situation. It is compelling people to do something which they, almost by definition, do not want to do. By providing this provision for a conscientious objection in the case of a particular war, the Government is opening up a Pandora's box&mdash;to use a very popular cliche. One just does not know what the tribunal would rule. We remain very strongly of the view that objections in the case of particular wars are going to be based on political feelings and political attitudes; consequently, we do not regard the amendment as satisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of deer industry Bills in total means that the industry has requested and the Government has agreed to the imposition on a share basis of government and industry of a research and development arrangement for this new industry. I believe that this new industry is an example, along with many other agricultural industries in Australia, of agriculture being one of the great sunrise industries of this country. Such industries always have flexibility and are innovative and inventive. Along with mining, being the most internationally exposed and oriented of our industries, they are more responsive to market demands internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among these new sunrise agricultural industries, the goat industry is a very significant one, whether it is for cashmere, for mohair or for meat. Unfortunately, the fibre section has suffered a similar downturn to that which impacted on the wool industry. Hopefully that is coming good again. At the present time a new genetic material, the Texan angora, is being released, shortly to be followed by the release of what is considered to be the world's best angora goats, those from strains from South Africa and Zimbabwe. These will really give a lift to this most important new industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In horticulture there is a whole range of new varieties. In my area of northern Victoria the Nashi or Asian pear is replacing, to a certain extent, the European pear in response to the market demands of Asia. One looks at the new tropical horticultural fruits that are being planted and at the development of the tea and coffee industry. We have some more exotic new industries, such as the ostrich, emu and crocodile industries. The water buffalo industry has taken something of a pounding because of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, but it will come back again. Some animals are classified as wild animals and therefore cannot be commercialised. I think particularly of the kangaroo. If commercialisation of the kangaroo were permitted, we would have a very good industry with a very good form of low cholesterol meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grains industry is probably the best example of new varieties and responses to new markets. When one thinks of the varieties of grains grown in this country 20 years ago compared with those today, it is an amazing development. It covers coarse grains, oil seeds and legumes, and we were talking about that to a certain extent in Parliament last week. For example, canola results from the basic restructuring of an old variety to give a very high percentage of unsaturated oil. A large variety of beans and lupins are now commercially available. The deer industry ranks with all of these agricultural industries. At the moment some would say it is probably the most successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that, even if it is rather dear to get into at present. It is expanding at a very rapid rate, at about 25 per cent a year. There are about 1,000 farmers full or part time in that industry, and 155,000 deer&mdash;and that number will double in a few years. It is also an important export industry. It is a significant, and will be an even more significant, new agricultural industry. It has determined by its application to the Government for inclusion in the research and development arrangements to be more commercial, to be better able to target what it is after, and to embark upon the necessary research that is required if it is to maintain a competitiveness against the industries of other countries&mdash;and one thinks here particularly of New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is already a voluntary arrangement in place which the industry has instituted ahead of the statutory system, and about $25,000 has been donated. When it joins the statutory arrangements in the near future, it will join over 20 other agricultural industries on the same basis of a dollar for dollar, up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. That will cost the Government an estimated $30,000 next financial year, and $60,000 the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging that the industry, from its first year, is evidently prepared to provide more than is necessary for the matching grants. Its contribution will be $100,000. It is not unique among these new industries, or the industries that are coming into the research and development arrangements, in being prepared to go beyond the Government target. That was true also of some of the coarse grain industries that we were talking about recently in this Parliament. Once again I make the point that agriculture sets an example to other industries in this country of being prepared to make sacrifices for a solid research and development base, even in very difficult times. This will ensure that, in spite of the problems they have of a very high domestic cost structure, corrupt international markets, et cetera, those industries will survive. </PARA>

It has not been without some criticism within the industry. Not everybody in the industry supports it. I suppose it would be unique, actually, if that were the case. There are two problems that I hope the industry can sort out in the next few weeks. The first is to obtain that full support and, secondly, to have clarified one of the problems which I gather has led to some of the criticism or some of the uncertainty, and that is this question of double levies or double taxation. I hope the Minister can clarify that once and for all tonight. The industry has demonstrated very significant majority support and, therefore, those opposed to the proposal, in my view, do not support a significant minority which in any way should interfere with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will detail some of the steps ahead of this legislation, which in my view indicate a good relationship between the Department and the industry and within the industry itself. There has been plenty of opportunity for the necessary discussion, communication, et cetera. In 1989 there was a deer industry workshop sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. On 22 March 1991, the annual meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia passed unanimously a motion to proceed with the statutory levy requirement. The Tasmanian section of the industry was a member at that time and participated in that unanimous vote. In August 1991 at a national conference at Albury, attended by over 300 deer breeders, once again there was a unanimous vote for a voluntary levy until the statutory levy commenced. On 9 October 1991 the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia formally requested a statutory levy to begin from 1 July 1992. On 21 November 1991 the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania advised the Minister of its withdrawal from the national organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then there has been that conflict, letter writing campaign and so forth. However, of recent days strong support for the proposal has emerged. For example, the Victorian Deer Farmers Association&mdash;and Victoria has the biggest number of deer breeders in the Commonwealth&mdash;at its meeting on 19 March passed a vote by 59 to 2 in favour of all of the levies. Also, at an earlier time, in February 1991, at a special meeting of over 200 deer breeders, it supported the proposal. At the same time, 20 March, Mr John Andrews, the President of the New South Wales association, also confirmed that the New South Wales industry supported the proposal and rejected comments by the Junior Vice-President of that association. The Australian Fallow Deer Society Inc. at the same time indicated that it had over 50 per cent of the national herd. It gave strong support in a letter of 19 March from its President, John Holder. On the same day the Red Deer Society of Australia, the second largest of the three commercial deer varieties, also gave strong support. It made the point that as its deer produce all of the leviable products&mdash;venison, velvet and export livestock&mdash;it will be the largest contributor. Therefore, there is that support there also. Overall I believe that there has been stronger support for the proposal here than has been the case with many other industries and therefore the proposal should be supported. I do hope that the two problems I referred to earlier can be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those concerns Tasmania, which constitutes 8 per cent of the industry. It withdrew from the association because it had been critical of the deer industry development group, which is a deer advisory body to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The point has been made by none other than the Minister for Primary Industry in Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray, that that State feels that it has an adequate State development arrangement for the industry, and there is a request to delay the Bill to allow time for more discussions. The industry does recognise that it has a challenge to bring the Tasmanians back into the fold. I understand that they have been invited to the next annual general meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia this month, and hopefully that will be accepted by them. At that meeting there will be a review of the membership of the deer industry development group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem mentioned in the correspondence and in the phone calls received is this potential problem of double charging or double levies, namely, a levy both on an animal with regard to, say, velvet and as a live export. I believe that this is a matter of misunderstanding. I do ask the Minister to clarify the situation about double levying. There should not be any, and I anticipate there is no need for there to be any. That would then remove one of the criticisms that have been apparent from some of the dissidents. </PARA>

My understanding is that this matter will be referred briefly to a Senate committee, which will provide some opportunity to further clarify the situation and encourage negotiations between the sections of the industry. This should not be used as any reason to basically delay or impede the legislation. Therefore, the coalition supports the legislation and commends the industry for making that very important step to be part of the overall rural industries research and development arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill forms part of a package of five Bills to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, it is pleasing to see so many smaller, newer and, one may say, exotic primary industries come into line with the larger primary industries in regard to research and development, which is the key for the future. It is the case, as the honourable member for Murray says, that agriculture is going to be one of the sunrise industries. It certainly does lead the way in many aspects in regard to the recognition of research and development. The proposed levies and charges have been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four other Bills in this package. Three provide for a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia, a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia or used in the production of other goods in Australia and a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia. The fifth Bill in this package makes provision for consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is good to see so many innovative industries. I fully concur with the honourable member for Murray in regard to kangaroos. There is a massive potential there to utilise and farm a natural resource. As technology improves, we will be able to do that. It does make sense to value add in regard to kangaroos. In my area emus and ostriches are now being introduced and farmed because of their potential. Marron, fibre goats and fresh water fish are also now coming to the fore. It was pleasing to see the goat fibre levy Bills come through&mdash;I think it was only last year or the year before&mdash;as well as the course grains legislation which came through last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Murray also said&mdash;in fact, he has clearly covered the major background to this Bill&mdash;there are approximately 1,000 deer farmers in Australia with something like 155,000 to 160,000 deer. The majority&mdash;something like half&mdash;do reside in Victoria. I guess that, while we in Queensland do have the best climate in the world, it is not as conducive to deer breeding as is the climate in the southern States. So I guess we do have to let the south have some industries to itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deer Farmers Federation of Australia is the sole industry representative organisation, other than specific breed&mdash;that is, fallow, red, or rusa&mdash;societies. It has about 550 members, which is a high percentage of farms in comparison with any rural industry. At a deer industry workshop in 1989, which was sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the research priorities for the industry were considered and it was decided that, although farm based production research was important, it was not the priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RIRDC, in consultation with the DFFA, commissioned Australian Agricultural Consulting and Marketing Co. Pty Ltd to conduct a deer marketing and production study, the results of which were released in June 1991. The study looked at the strategic priorities for research into the production, marketing and processing aspects of the deer industry. At an annual general meeting of the DFFA held on 22 March 1991, the following resolution was passed unanimously:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a slaughter levy and velvet levy be accepted and working within the time frame for it to be finalised by the end of June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania was a member of the DFFA at the time. As the honourable member for Murray has also pointed out, the Tasmanian deer industry has about 85 deer farmers and accounts for about 8 per cent of the national herd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an open meeting of the DFFA in August 1991, which was attended by approximately 300 people, the meeting voted unanimously for a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and on deer numbers behind wire to raise revenue for the RIRDC until the statutory levy was available. On 23 September 1991 the managing director of the RIRDC wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) informing him that the RIRDC and the DFFA had reached an agreement whereby the RIRDC had offered to finance an industry development program up to $200,000 for each of the next three years, dependent upon an industry commitment of at least $1 for each $2 from the RIRDC in 1990-91 and rising to dollar for dollar in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the program is expected to include: evaluation of livestock marketing systems; market development, with initial focus on the domestic food services sector, then export; information systems on livestock supply and product markets; livestock and meat trading and training; velvet trading language and training; production studies with a focus on nutrition, carcass quality and evaluation of production systems; animal health studies, including quarantine; communication with industry practitioners; and program management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least two-thirds of available funds in the first year are to be directed to market development activity. The focus will be on product standards adding value to the product and extension and training on the use of the products, especially venison. Good links with the food services sector are being developed and product handling, user information and training packages are expected to be key components of the market development project. The program is not expected to include product advertising and the Corporation considers there would be diseconomies in trying to separate the research, development and promotional elements for such a small industry at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 October 1991 the DFFA wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy formally requesting the introduction of statutory levy arrangements from 1 July 1992. Tasmania was a member of the DFFA at that time. On 21 November 1991, the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania wrote to the Minister advising that the Council had withdrawn membership from the DFFA, citing the following reasons:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our members consider the deer industry Action Plan to be inappropriate to Tasmanian circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister replied to that letter, indicating that the proposed statutory levies were going to replace the existing voluntary levy arrangements and would be a more equitable arrangement; that there is no power under the Constitution to grant exemption to a State from a Commonwealth charge, levy or excise, and nor should there be; that Tasmanians cannot isolate themselves from developments in the industry, particularly as the mainland States already form a significant market for that State's deer and deer products; and that it is clear that it is the will of the majority of the deer industry to have statutory levy arrangements introduced and that the Minister would be introducing legislation to give effect to such. The Minister recommended that the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania should have further discussions with the DFFA and RIRDC to resolve the differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian concerns are not unanimous, as four producers are contributing to a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and deer behind wire until statutory levy arrangements are in place. Further, the Fallow Deer Society and the Red Deer Society&mdash;which represent deer breeds that account for 90 per cent of deer in Australia and which include Tasmanian members&mdash;have endorsed the full levy package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the drafting of the deer industry legislation, a number of potential loopholes were identified which also had the potential of undermining the levy base. At a telephone conference of the DFFA and State delegates in February 1992, there was unanimous support for an export charge on deer velvet and live deer. This was subsequently conveyed to the Minister. The conference stated that, contrary to some misconceptions in the deer industry, the proposed deer velvet export charge would be imposed only in cases when, at the time of export, velvet had not been previously sold and therefore was not subject to levy under the proposed velvet sale levy. It stated that, prior to 1992, there had been only small ad hoc shipments of live deer. However&mdash;and it is good news&mdash;the prospect of an expanding live deer export market to Korea would divert deer from slaughter and seriously undermine the deer slaughter levy base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Murray: it would be good if it were possible for the Tasmanian industry to see the commonsense of coming into line and being part of the whole industry. I think that will happen over time. We have seen in almost all other cases concerning research and development that, even if there has been some small amount of disagreement initially, people have seen the advantage of a unified approach to research and development. We are one nation; one country. Whether it be Tasmania, Victoria or Queensland, R&amp;D is equally important to the whole industry. I am very pleased to support the Bill and I am pleased that the Opposition is doing so as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation will establish a deer industry research development fund through industry levies and government contributions. I think it would be unnecessarily repetitious for me to retrace the already detailed history of the industry given by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the background to the legislation which has already been covered more than adequately by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the magnanimous way for which you are well known, you will forgive me if I pause now to observe that this legislation will give the facilities so that levies can in fact be charged against the industry to raise the dough needed for research and development in the industry. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) will be aware, the funding is required to buck up the industry, because without this sort of legislation there is a real danger that it may stagnate. I know that the industry did not go fawning to the Minister in order to have this legislation passed, but in fact indicated that it thought the participation in those sorts of research and development arrangements which already exist for other industries would be a good idea. I do not want to be frivolous about the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I genuinely do not want to be frivolous about the legislation because, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, this is an industry of which Australia ought to be proud. The Australian deer population has been expanding by 25 per cent a year. It is currently estimated that there are 1,000 farms carrying something like 155,000 deer. These figures have been largely derived from the industry itself and not from the normal sources applying to primary industry, such as ABARE.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a sunrise industry, and much of the innovation and much of the adventurous approach to new industries that characterise Australian agriculture can be seen in the development of the Australian deer industry. The significance of this legislation and this opportunity to raise funds through these Bills is pronounced when one considers that until now the deer breeders have been receiving funds through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation which is financed by the Government through the special rural research fund and voluntary levies. In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program, the industry has chosen this statutory levy on all producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a credit to the enthusiasm that deer producers have for their industry that they have chosen to take this particular course, as has been clearly outlined by the honourable member for Murray. A measure of the commitment that the industry has to research and development can be gleaned simply by comparing the figure that has been raised as a result of the voluntary levies, which was about $25,000 last year, with the money that is anticipated as a result of the statutory levy, which will be in the vicinity of $100,000 in 1992-93. That $100,000 provides a real opportunity for the deer industry to be involved in the sort of research and development that characterises primary industries around Australia. As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation before the House will set an operative rate of 18c a kilogram on a hot dressed carcass with a maximum rate of 30c on venison, an operative rate of $10 a head of live deer exported and a maximum rate of $20 a head, and a 5 per cent operative rate on velvet, where there will also be a maximum rate of 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, I do not think I should delay the House by running through the history of the industry, but may I bring in a synopsis of the industry by pointing out to the House that deer were introduced into Australia in the early nineteenth century from Europe, Asia and North America. As we now know, there are fallow deer, which make up the majority of farmed deer, and red deer, which represent the largest number of deer currently being farmed in Queensland. Of the venison currently being produced on Australian deer farms, much of it is consumed locally, and that consumption meets about a third of the Australian demand. The remainder of the venison to meet the demand in Australia is imported from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the operation of CER, Australian venison producers are finding themselves under some pressure from New Zealand producers. In fact, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe has meant that the once lucrative West German market, which was open to New Zealand producers, has now been largely minimised. As a result of that, the New Zealanders, having been denied the West German market or portions thereof, are looking for alternative markets and, increasingly, making venison available to Australia. This puts real pressure on Australia's venison producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something of an irony there in that, in an electorate such as mine, a large number of the venison producers are in areas that were formerly used for dairy farms. The very problems that the dairy farmers faced are now being faced by the venison producers with the competition that they have to contend with from across the Tasman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might tonight ask ourselves the question: why does New Zealand succeed and Australia fail in this sort of competitive exercise? It is fair to make three brief observations. First, it is fair to say that the New Zealanders have been much more market oriented than we have in the past and in a number of areas&mdash;Kiwi fruit is a classic one&mdash;we have actually seen the New Zealanders as quite aggressive marketers and they have become a role model for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is also fair to make two other observations. The cost of production has fallen in New Zealand&mdash;despite popular opinion, largely as a result of its industrial relations and transport reform, and as a result of the adoption of a GST there, an adoption which has been endorsed by the New Zealand Farmers Federation. So we might confidently expect that a tax which reduces the tax burden borne by producers could advantage Australian producers just as it has advantaged New Zealand producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the deer industry in Australia but three or four years ago was an industry going through a great deal of speculation. Stock was coming in from New Zealand that was expensive. It was being bought up by Australian producers who thought they saw in this stock an opportunity to raise the profile and the genetic material available in the Australian industry. In fact, that balloon burst and, in many ways, unkind though that has been to deer producers, that has been a good thing because some of the ridiculous speculation that existed in the industry has now evaporated and we find the industry now focusing on what is an economically viable and sensible course open to it. That only highlights the need for effective research and development in the Australian deer industry if we are not only going to match our New Zealand counterparts but also preferably outperform them with Australian innovation, Australian adventure and the enthusiasm that Australians have for new product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate tonight is valuable, not because there is any controversy in the House but because it focuses attention on an industry which has been largely ignored by the rest of Australia. As previous speakers have said, we have a great deal to be excited about in terms of sunrise industries in Australian agriculture and horticulture. Even in the traditional Australian wheat and wool industries new enterprises are being developed which make them the sorts of places where people may well want to place some risk capital. We will see that, no doubt, on Thursday in the National Wool Day display that is going to be held here in Parliament House. It is not only in the wheat and wool industries but also in horticulture, meat marketing, the ostrich industry and all the others named by previous speakers where we see the opportunity for sunrise industry resulting from Australian innovation in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the comments made by the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Hinkler. I hope honourable members will forgive me if I conclude my remarks in this debate as I began them, by indicating that the only thing inappropriate about this legislation is that we are debating it at Easter eve when we should be debating it at yuletide. I would like to indicate that the legislation before the House is good news for Rudolph, Dasher, Dancer, Comet, Prancer and Blitzen, and for all of the Santa Clauses dependent on the deer industry in Australia. </PARA>

Briefly, the package of five Bills before us seeks to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We so often hear from some people on the other side that we are bad guys. Are we nasty?  Are we doing the wrong thing by the deer farmers?  Well, let us look at the situation. We are imposing these levies and charges for the development of a program for one reason only. The reason&mdash;as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, has just advised me&mdash;is that the industry requested the very thing that we are providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have about 10 minutes, so I will not take too long on the machinery parts of the Bills. I will, however, make some references to the deer farming operations in my electorate of Hunter. In 1986 I had the pleasure of accompanying the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, when he officially opened the first abattoir to process deer meat in Australia. The abattoir, Mirrabooka Meats, is owned and operated by Mr Michael Scarfe. In the early years of operation of the abattoir, Michael Scarfe suffered the ups and downs that seem to abound when one is trying to get a new industry established. But I would like to think that the worst is now behind Michael. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession, of course, has affected Mirrabooka Meats, but Michael Scarfe remains confident of the future and is very supportive of the Bills now being debated. Michael is in favour of the legislation because he believes that it is the only way that the deer industry will have a voice in Federal Parliament. He is delighted to have the support of the Government in its agreeing to the recommendations made by the industry. `We are going about it in the right way', said Michael Scarfe. `It is the only fair way the industry is going to support itself and be supported by the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mirrabooka Meats processes all varieties of deer including red, fallow, chital and rusa, et cetera. Last year Mirrabooka slaughtered 2,000 head, and 98 per cent was exported to Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the Pacific islands including Fiji, New Guinea and America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Scarfe is in favour of the levy that will promote research in the industry. He was fortunate to win a guernsey from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to study in Japan and Singapore, so he says that he knows the value that the Corporation can have for the deer industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael commented that the legislation widely covers what is needed in the industry. For too long the industry has been fragmented, trying to go it alone and not realising its full potential. In Michael Scarfe's words, the industry not only needs to support itself but also needs the support of the government body to stop illegal slaughtering and similar styles of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Scarfe strongly concurs with the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that the deer industry is emerging as another facet of the rural industry with enormous potential to broaden the base of agriculture. Mr Scarfe's only concern, of course, is New Zealand competition. It is hard to compete with New Zealand when that country has a herd of 1.2 million deer behind wire and Australia has only 155,000. This affects the cost of the end product and is the reason why venison is more highly priced than other meats, Mr Scarfe told me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Scarfe is also very pleased that legislation will provide for a professional approach to be taken to the production, slaughter and promotion of deer meat. As he says, because of its extremely low fat content it should be promoted as a health food. However, it is true to say that to date there has been little promotion of venison and it appears only rarely on restaurant menus. Anyone who has tasted venison steaks or venison sausages will know that it is a delicious alternative to other meats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DFFA, which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia, has Mr Bob Coombs as its Executive Director. Mr Coombs is supportive of the proposed legislation. He said that the deer industry needs to change from being production driven to serving the needs of consumers first. The DFFA also identified the need to develop an industry information base, a need highlighted by the recently released study into the deer industry by the Australian Agricultural Consulting and Management Co. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the five minutes remaining to me I will not repeat information which has already been conveyed to the House by previous speakers. I will make a couple of suggestions, though, including that more up to date information about the industry should be circulated to deer farmers by an efficient method. I think dairy farmers do it very well with their magazine which keeps dairy farmers very well informed about what is happening in their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Coombs also stresses that the industry must make wise use of government development initiatives, such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Deer farming is very capital intensive. Not only are the animals themselves very expensive to buy, but the intensive use of high wire fencing, pasture improvement, veterinary charges and so on is very costly.

Where would the dairy industry and our great wool industry be without pasture improvement techniques and land care management plans?

It gives a good outline of the difficulties being faced by Mr Holder. The reason for the difficulties which all deer farmers in Australia face is that the New Zealand industry has several advantages: the number of deer compared with what we have in Australia, and the fact that New Zealanders eat 400 tonnes of venison each year, whereas our much larger population in Australia eats the same quantity of venison. As well, up to 65 per cent of the venison consumed in Australia is venison which is imported from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the New Zealand industry is about 10 years older than the Australian industry, and I know that the New Zealanders spend a lot of money on public awareness and consumption campaigns; but is it not crazy that we should eat New Zealand rather than Australian venison? The New Zealand industry has actually gone out and promoted its meat as being low in fat with virtually no cholesterol, and it has conveyed the message that venison has tremendous potential as a health food. But is not Australian venison low in fat with virtually no cholesterol? We have to get our act together, and we must do that if we are to sell our product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Professor Friedrich August von Hayek, one of the greatest individuals of the twentieth century, who died on Tuesday, 24 March at the grand age of 92. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and Senator Kemp have already alerted the Parliament to his passing. Professor von Hayek, along with Dr Ludwig von Mises, was one of the great economists and political philosophers of the Austrian school who took forward and refined to an exact degree the earlier works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and others. In doing so, they established in concrete for time immemorial the absolute principles of free market capitalism. The contribution of people such as von Hayek cannot be judged too highly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latter day disciples, such as the Americans, Henry Hazlitt and Milton Friedman, owed their all to the pioneering courage and thoroughness of the Austrians. I say `courage' because people such as von Hayek stood largely alone for long periods against the rest of the world throughout some of its most difficult history. Von Hayek established with incredible clarity that undeniable link between personal liberty and economic freedom. He demonstrated that we cannot ever have the former, unless we also have the latter. Any serious student of economics, politics or philosophy who has not given adequate time and consideration to understanding this link will always have a yawning gap in his education. Regrettably, the simple lesson of that link has tragically been ignored numerous times throughout history, including the history of the twentieth century. This has resulted in the suppression and death of many millions of people with the misery endured in recent decades, by the peoples of eastern Europe being the classic example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Von Hayek warned not only of the evils of communism, socialism, fascism and, indeed, all forms of totalitarianism, but also of the `softer' forms of socialism that were manifesting themselves at the time in countries such as Sweden and Britain. His book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road to Serfdom</EMPHASIS> published in 1944 informed many, for the first time, of the ultimate evils of interventionism in government, however well-intentioned such intervention might be at the time. Whether it be communism in Russia, Keynesianism in Britain or even the accord in Australia, there is an indelible message in von Hayek's writing that we ignore at our peril. `Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it' is a most apt saying in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Friedrich von Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 and became a naturalised British citizen in 1938 during Hitler's rise to power. He had published more than 25 books and some 250 papers and shared the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. Australia was honoured with a visit by von Hayek in 1976. I well recall the impressive performance he gave on the television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monday Conference</EMPHASIS> during that trip. It has been said that his ideas did more for Europe's freedom than any other individual. The clear logic of the principles he championed touched so many people in so many countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I clearly remember when I first read his monumental work, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Constitution of Liberty</EMPHASIS>, nearly 20 years ago, that it had a profound effect in shaping my life. I am forever grateful to this extraordinary man for instilling in me the true worth of personal liberty. Not a day goes by when the concepts that he espoused do not influence my actions in some way. I have no doubt that von Hayek saw the collapse of communism in Europe more clearly than anyone else. It certainly would have been no surprise to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somehow fitting that, on the day of his death, the last of Europe's communist dictatorships, Albania, finally embraced democracy. Let us hope that the communism and totalitarianism that still clings on in China, Cuba and other parts of the world can be largely swept aside before this century is out. If that happens, it is something that Friedrich von Hayek not only would have approved of, but would have predicted. Long live the ideas that he developed, believed in and shared with us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that New Zealanders should have work visas. In that way we would control the industries that they go into. If there already is unemployment in Australia in a particular industry, as there is in the shearing industry, commonsense and logic must surely dictate that work visas should be issued. In that way a quota system can be implemented and the work loads regulated. As there is no requirement for visiting New Zealanders to acquire visas or work permits, which is required of any other visitor to Australia, this unregulated, open access policy is leaving the shearing industry and other industries open to abuse by visitors from New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The future of the Australian Wheat Board's ability to successfully market the nation's wheat crop is at serious risk. The 1993-94 season looms as a deadline for a decision by the Government on whether Australia should retain the AWB as a single-desk wheat seller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major multinational grain traders operating in Australia have recently begun a campaign against the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly under the guise of the Australian Grain Exporters Association, the AGEA. Ironically, the AGEA's eight members include subsidiaries of North American and European traders, namely, Continental Grain, Cargill, ConAgra Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Ltd. There is absolutely nothing Australian about this group whatsoever. Replacing the Australian Wheat Board with such organisations would not be in the interests of the Australian wheat grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Taiwan signed a contract for Australian wheat after a seven-year campaign by the board to enter its lucrative market. Taiwan is expected to buy 50,000 tonnes of grain from Australia this year. Foreign grain companies would not have bothered putting in this effort on behalf of the Australian wheat grower. Instead, private grain traders would have simply shipped wheat from other sources&mdash;in many cases, subsidised sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Given ABARE's recent prediction that average farm income will be a negative $30,000 this financial year, taking the time to source new markets and ensure benefits for growers is paramount to the continued viability of an important export earning industry. The Australian Wheat Board has successfully marketed Australian wheat since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Today Australia is within the top five wheat exporting countries in the world. The Australian Wheat Board has maintained this position against all odds; that is, against the escalating subsidy war of the European Community and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In excess of 80 per cent of annual world wheat trade goes to markets which have single-desk buyers, including Japan, China, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and the Federation of Russian States. A single-desk seller in these circumstances is more strongly placed to hold its negotiating position. The majority of our competitors have the benefit of a 100 per cent Government guarantee on credit sales. Further, the Australian Wheat Board cover for sales through the Export Finance Insurance Corporation is usually around 80 per cent. Only in Australia is the residual risk borne by the growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian Wheat Board has for 60 years looked after the interests of the Australian wheat farmer. The domestic market, which accounts for about three million tonnes or more than 20 per cent of the average harvest, is now totally deregulated. The Australian Wheat Board separates wheat into 40 classes based on protein levels and other qualities, and pays farmers accordingly. Massive savings have been passed on to growers through port and rail reforms initiated and followed through by the Australian Wheat Board. Growers are guaranteed payment within 21 days of delivery. The Australian Wheat Board does not shy from marketing efforts in more difficult countries, as the Taiwanese example illustrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I challenge the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to support the National and Liberal Party policy of single-desk selling. I further challenge the Minister to get out from underneath his own desk and support the National and Liberal Party policy to underwrite 95 per cent of the Australian wheat crop based on a harvest price. While ever the Minister procrastinates, he is undermining customer confidence and risking another protracted debate of the wool controversy proportions. This must be avoided at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact that in excess of 80 per cent of annual world wheat trade is conducted through single-desk selling to single-desk buying should be a major consideration for the Minister, and I challenge the Minister to take a position sooner and not later.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) in his speech concerning the Australian Workers Union members and shearers who currently find themselves unemployed. The concern that I have is precisely the concern that he has, that with the current open-door policy between Australia and New Zealand a significant number of New Zealand shearers are coming over here and taking the work away from Australian shearers. That is one aspect, which is the immigration aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is clearly the question of tax evasion whereby they do not reach the tax threshold and simply move off without reaching it. I believe that on two counts we have a difficulty we have to address. I know that it is not in the interests of any of the Australian farmers, either, to be supporting a situation in which Australian workers are being denied work and well-trained people are being kept out of work, and at the same time there is a tax rort going on. I am sure that many people would support that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Throsby for his remarks about Wool Day, because I think that will be a very important day for us. This is an issue that we will keep going on with, and I want to assure people who are interested in it that it is not a matter to which we will give just brief attention. It underpins a real concern that a number of us have. The honourable member for Throsby articulated that very well. I know that his remarks draw support from a number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention another matter. Towards the end of last year in Geraldton in Western Australia I opened the Community Legal Service Centre. The Community Legal Service Centre has a staff of a full time solicitor, a full time legal secretary, a full time financial counsellor and a full time coordinator and child support adviser. The Community Legal Service <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>C<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>entre is designed to provide legal advice, effectively, and legal support to people on low incomes. The difficulty that that centre has had is that it has been opposed, and to some extent given an embargo, by three people in the town of Geraldton&mdash;a Mr Duncan Armstrong, a Mr George Giudice and a Mr Robert Glenn&mdash;who have been trying to make life very difficult for the centre. I represented Senator Michael Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, in opening the centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other thing that concerns me is that not only have these people opposed the establishment of this centre, which breaks the legal stranglehold that they had over the availability of legal services in the town; but, further to that, they have also been attacking a lawyer with the Aboriginal Legal Service, a Mr Terry Malone. They have, in effect, been quite political about it because they persuaded Mr Eric Charlton, the National Party shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to claim that Mr Malone is not doing his work because he is engaging in outside practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to put the record straight on this: Mr Malone was given the right of private practice because at the time he went there the only way that the Aboriginal Legal Service could retain someone of his stature was to allow him to supplement his income. This was an arrangement entered into quite properly and quite freely. Similar arrangements are entered into in Queensland with the Aboriginal Legal Service. So in effect the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Community Legal Service Centre in Geraldton have had Mr Malone working particularly for them. Also, additionally, he has been able, quite properly, to make extra income. I might point out that the Aboriginals themselves have not complained about this. In fact, they rather take some pride in the fact that Mr Malone is not an inferior lawyer but one who is able to make his mark in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned about that because more recently there was a case involving a Mr Ken Dan, a young Aboriginal who was arrested by a policeman for wearing a pair of surfer's sunglasses. Unfortunately, the policeman at the time did not understand that Ken Dan is a very successful surfer in Western Australia, be it that he is Aboriginal. The reason he had the pair of sunglasses was that it was one of those things that people like him are often offered as a result of their success in surfing. Had it not been for Mr Malone and the Aboriginal Legal Service, Mr Dan would not have been properly represented. I will not comment further on the outcome of the trial&mdash;that would not be proper&mdash;except to say that Mr Dan won the case and was properly represented by Mr Malone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The point I want to get on record here is that I am concerned about these attacks on the Community Legal Service Centre and the Aboriginal Legal Service and Mr Malone because I believe that he is doing a good job. There is nothing wrong with his taking outside practice, and I believe that the town of Geraldton is better served by having proper legal representation. I appreciate the opportunity to put this on the record in the House tonight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abattoir at Camperdown is in the heartland of Corangamite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, in Australia we have this terrible situation of one million people unemployed. The track record of Mr Wally Curran, a very influential figure in the Labor movement and the Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, in creating jobs for his workers has been that 10 years ago there were 7,500 meatworkers employed in the export processing industry and now there are 1,700. In view of his record, how could he be an adviser to the Prime Minister on job creation? What would his contribution be in view of his great ability to reduce the number of jobs available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offered the Prime Minister a formal invitation to come to Camperdown to have a look at the job that Mr Curran had done and the way in which he had stopped this particular works operating and reduced jobs in the meat processing industry. I invited the Prime Minister to come and talk to management, to talk to the unionists and to talk to the picketers on the job. As usual, the Prime Minister did not take up my invitation to come to Camperdown; he took up a number of invitations to go to other businesses around Australia, but he did not come to one of the key industries in Victoria and have a look at what was actually going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fami, the new owner, purchased the works in 1991 on the basis that he wanted to introduce some new work practices, get more productivity, make a change to the infamous tally system and introduce contract labour. On that basis he employed Troubleshooters, which was able to provide contract labour to work efficiently, get paid for the work that they did and, in fact, work five days a week, which is not always the norm in the meat industry, to get the tasks done. Mr Fami was following the example at Wodonga, where McPhee's had 82 days of strike which cost $3m, but at the end of that they were able to employ contract meatworkers. There are now 325 jobs at that works and a 40 per cent improvement in productivity. Just think about it&mdash;a 40 per cent improvement in productivity by those contract workers. That is a far cry from what was suggested at Camperdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Camperdown owner wanted to repeat the exercise down there, but, of course, the AMIEU set up a picket line, so much so that to get to the job, the contract workers had to travel in a furniture van, leaving at 7 a.m. and protected by a police force of between 40 and 80 men, along with police horses. The picket line was pretty rough; there was intimidation of the contract workers and standover tactics were adopted. All that is on the public record. Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) really defend the tactics of those picketers on that line during these fairly tough times? The town of Camperdown was divided and there were abusive telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been raised in this Parliament and also in the Victorian Parliament, where there has been false information and misrepresentation of the situation. The farmers have not been able to process their cattle, 40 jobs have not been created and, of course, the 170 jobs that used to be there are no longer available. The works are closed and the basic reasons are the outdated industrial relations practices going back to the nineteenth century, the luddite attitude of Secretary Wally Curran and also, of course, the leniency of the courts in interpreting the picket line situation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

So, before I pass judgment, I would want to hear the other version, the other side of the story, to get a comprehensive picture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to talk about this shabby document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> The honourable member for Corangamite has just presented what appears to be the truth. Let us have a look at this shabby and deceitful document&mdash;the false presentation and the failure of those who sit opposite to come clean and explain the inaccuracies and the falsities that it contains<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>. At the moment they are distributing information around Australia, trying to tell people that they are all going to be better off by having a 15 per cent tax imposed on the food they put in their mouths, on the clothes they put on their backs, on the shoes they put on their feet and on the fruit and vegetables they buy. The Opposition is saying to everybody, `Don't you worry about that; you are all going to finish up with more money in your pocket'. But when Treasury does the analysis and we get a detailed examination, we find beyond doubt that 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed and farmer households will be worse off. That is indisputable fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we find the truth is exposed about this document. The imposition of a 15 per cent tax on all those goods and services that are not taxable is about shifting the tax burden from the higher income groups down the line to the lower income groups. It is the old ideology; back to the old class society&mdash;it is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury examination exposes that wage and salary earners and self-employed and farm households on $90,000 per year and more will be better off by between $15 and $105 per week. Each of the honourable members opposite has constituents trying to live on $105 per week, trying to survive on that, yet honourable members opposite say that is too much. This document also says there are too many people on welfare and those who are on welfare are being paid too much. That is the real essence of what the Opposition is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind those opposite of page 116 and the dishonesty of this document, and the failure of those who sit opposite to stand up in this place and explain it. Page 116 states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of an average home the net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and petrol tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Which version is true? Or are not new homes not family homes? Are new homes not classified as family homes? Is that what Opposition members are saying?

Nor would it be practicable to list all of the detailed changes which have been made. The more significant changes however, include deferral of a decision on the construction of a third over-the-horizon radar until later in this decade, cancellation of the inshore minehunter program in favour of the acquisition of coastal minehunters of proven design, cancellation of acquisition of a craft of opportunity minesweeping core force, and deferral of acquisition of a second company group lift of Blackhawk helicopters for Army.</PARA>
