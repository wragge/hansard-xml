<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a relatively short report. It is part of the Committee's ongoing review of the Standing Orders, and deals substantially with the standing orders 303, 304 and 305, which deal with disorder in the House. It also recommends the removal of sexist language and deals with standing orders relating to strangers. The former consists largely of wording changes with respect to the sexist language we impose on female members. The current Standing Orders tend to suggest that a female member cannot be named, because they state that `he' may be named. With the recommended change in language, female members would be dealt with the same as male members are.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an aside. The major changes are in the area of discipline. We have taken the opportunity to recommend a change in the penalty that may be applied to a member who has been suspended. The present penalties are 24 hours for the first offence&mdash;which remains&mdash;seven calendar days for the second offence and 28 calendar days for any subsequent offence. We have recommended that those periods be changed to 24 hours, three sitting days and seven sitting days, which means that the same penalty would apply, irrespective of when the suspension took place. At the moment, a member could be suspended at the end of a sitting period and serve a lesser penalty than someone who got 24 hours earlier in the week. We think that sitting days are appropriate for suspension times. The suspension times recommended are slightly less than the existing penalties but, depending on which day of the week it is, a member's suspension could be longer than under the current provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommends that the motion for the suspension of a member should be proposed by the Speaker&mdash;the person in the chair&mdash;rather than, as is the present requirement, by a Minister. The Committee thinks that it is appropriate that, where a person is named by the Speaker, it should not be left to another person to determine whether or not the Speaker's naming shall be proceeded with. The Committee thinks that that is a prerogative of the Speaker and that there should not be a requirement for the Leader of the House or another member to move such a motion. It is normally a formality. It is something which is properly the province of the Chair. What the Committee proposes would not change the way in which the motion is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation in this report is that there should be reintroduced into the Standing Orders a provision&mdash;it did exist at an earlier time&mdash;whereby the Speaker can ask a member to leave the chamber, normally for the remainder of the sitting day or until the next suspension of sitting or for a period otherwise set by the Speaker. Such a provision would not deny the member directed to withdraw the right to vote in the chamber and his withdrawal would not require a vote of the chamber. In a moment of heat in the chamber, perhaps during the Budget Speech or the reply to the Budget Speech or on some other occasion, the Speaker may feel that it is not appropriate to move for the suspension of a member or that a member's behaviour is such that the penalty of suspension is not warranted but, nevertheless, it would be in the interests of the House for that member to be removed for a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation that the right of such a member to vote in divisions not be taken away is to protect the House against any action which may change the voting pattern or change voting in the House. Apart from divisions, the member would be expected to remain out of the House. If the member refused to comply, or if the member acted other than in the spirit of that order from the Chair, the provision remains that the Speaker could name the member concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned to put before the House proposals which would assist the workings of the House and which would assist the Chair in keeping order. I think it is fair to say that previous speakers have felt that suspension is the blunt end of the axe and that quite often it is not an appropriate penalty for the crime of the time. If the Speaker had an additional weapon, which I suppose we could call a soft option&mdash;or what could be called a sin-bin&mdash;it would add to the flexibility available to the Speaker to keep order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 1992, which is being presented for the second time. I bring to the notice of the Parliament the fact that, as of March this year, the Government has changed the Australian design rules so that all new motorcycles sold from that time onwards will have the headlight hard wired. That means that whether a person buys a motorcycle for use on the road or whether he buys one that still has the ability to be registered and used off-road, the motorcycle will have the light on at all times when the engine is running.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to revoke that ADR. The reason for doing this is that, quite simply, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has not put forward compelling evidence to show that having the headlight on at all times will improve safety. I emphasise that this is a question of whether or not it improves safety. We are not against the concept of making motorcycling safer. Certainly, a lot of riders do ride with their lights on, but the key point of all this is that they should have the choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had discussions with many experienced motorcycle riders, and they believe that one of the most important things is not just being able to have the light on, but being able to flash it. At times they may wish to turn the light off. This ADR takes away that right. It could also give a false sense of security by leading motorcyclists to believe that they may have an additional level of safety where, in fact, they may not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the evidence from research shows that there are no conclusive results that this will add to safety. It is a subjective assessment that has been made by the Minister. It has been made, I believe, on the basis that he wants to be seen to be doing something, rather than because there is hard evidence to show that this will improve safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are other drawbacks to this. In his rush to be seen to be doing something, the Minister for Land Transport has not done a proper cost-benefit analysis of the proposal. He has not consulted properly with many of the experienced riders in this nation. On many occasions, those experienced riders have expressed their concern about this rule, because they believe that it is not adding to safety. The important point is that while we all support moves that will make motorcycle riding safer, the fact is that this has not been shown to do that. The important thing is that riders should have that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also significant that there are some studies that show that having the light on all the time can cause other road users to have difficulty in judging the speed and the distance of an oncoming vehicle. It is interesting to note that even the Minister is starting to acknowledge that point. In a letter that he wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Motorcycle News</EMPHASIS> in September this year in response to another letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only claim which  may have some validity is that the perception of distances could be slightly distorted.</PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is quite a significant admission by the Minister that he may have moved too quickly on this and that, in pushing for compulsory lights on, he may have overlooked some of the side effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other concerns, particularly the question of the legal status of a cyclist whose headlight might have blown. A question then would arise as to what is the legal liability of someone who is involved in an accident. It is also very significant to note that the Victorian Social Development Committee, in the last State Parliament, conducted a major inquiry and urged the Government to delay the introduction of this Australian design rule until further results from studies overseas had been analysed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this shows very clearly that the Minister has acted in indecent haste, and as a consequence I have put forward this Bill to repeal that Australian design rule for compulsory lights on; for motorcycles sold after March this year to have their lights `hard-wired', as the terminology goes. It is my pleasure to formally present this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Flags Amendment Bill 1992. Yet again the coalition presents this Flags Amendment Bill, the purpose of which is to make it quite clear that the Australian flag will not be changed before a referendum is put to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant to note that there are already two other private members' Bills on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> on the question of the Australian flag. One of those has come from the Senate, which has already passed the Bill. I think it therefore adds to the pressure on the Government to accept that this Bill should be passed by this chamber also and therefore become law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Bill is one that has been placed there by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), so this Bill reinforces that. I pose a very serious question to the Government: why is it, when this Bill has been presented to the Parliament on at least six occasions, that the Government refuses to accept it and refuses to allow a vote on it? As all honourable members would have noticed, every Thursday morning petitions come into this Parliament in large numbers supporting this point of view. Yet the Government continues to refuse to listen to it. Therefore, one has to very seriously question Government's motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of support for the Australian flag, an opinion poll was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in May this year. It showed what everyone in this chamber would probably know: it reinforced the point that 60 per cent of Australians want to keep the Australian flag as it is. So why is it that the Government refuses to put this to the test by accepting this Bill? If it continues to push for change to the Australian flag, as the Prime Minister has been so keen to do this year, this ought to be put to a simple referendum of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many who hold the view that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been attacking our flag so vocally over the last few months as nothing more than a diversionary tactic to try to take attention away from the fact that the Government's economic record is so appalling, is so abysmal; that we have unemployment of around 11 per cent and it seems to be stuck there; that this Government basically has deserted its own supporters, the working men and women of Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, despite the fact that there is widespread support for the existing flag, the Prime Minister, according to press reports of May this year, was still pressing ahead for plans for a new Australian flag. We have not heard too much about it recently but, according to those reports, he was certainly prepared to push for a new design and to push for an alternative despite the support of the majority of Australians for the existing flag.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House endorses the statement on the distribution of wealth in Australia entitled `Common Wealth for the Common Good', issued by the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference and in particular supports the recommendations relating to (a) support for developing countries, (b) monitoring the Australian financial system, (c) a strengthened commitment to growth of employment, (d) improved availability of housing, (e) progressive and equitable taxation and social security systems, (f) improvements in health services and Medicare, (g) funding for education, (h) development of co-ordinated family policies, (i) justice for Aboriginal people, (j) recognition of the common good and of equity in all areas of Australian society and (k) the conduct of an inquiry into the distribution of wealth in Australia by the Commonwealth Government to be completed no later than 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a privilege to move this motion relating to the statement on the distribution of wealth in Australia by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>. This may well be the most important economic and policy statement ever published by the Catholic Church in Australia and perhaps by any Australian church. It fulfils the mission of the church to have a prophetic role in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement provides a comprehensive, rigorous and humane contribution to debate about public policy so as to make Australia a more just and equitable society. The statement is a challenge to every party, every politician, every public servant and every person concerned with public policy to adopt a central concern for justice and equity. As well, it is a challenge to people in Australia to commit themselves to solidarity, to each other, and to recognise that we have a responsibility to each other. The principles are explained eloquently. The biblical and theological basis for the recommendations are made transparently clear; the recommendations are comprehensive and practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the statement is that members of the church were asked what they regarded as the central issue of concern in Australian society at present. The distribution of income and wealth was what the majority of people said was most important. The Catholic bishops agreed to hold an inquiry into the distribution of wealth and, as a result of that, they have been discussing this issue for five years. They have held consultations in each diocese and they have produced this report. The central message of the report is contained in the foreword to the report by Cardinal Clancy. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common good cannot be served unless appropriate attention is given to the ethical and moral dimensions of economic, social and political questions . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Cardinal Clancy goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that accumulating wealth for its own sake, and in disregard of the needs of others, is contrary to God's vision of what human life is meant to be and is the source of conflict, inequality and oppression; and in the second place to suggest some practical ways of overcoming or attempting to overcome the resultant inequality.</PARA>
<PARA>The report's central statement of its message is, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the essential dignity of all persons, the need to work for the common good, and our duty to stand alongside poor people and to try to ensure that they are treated justly.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further on in the report it describes the central emphasis of the report as an emphasis on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">human dignity, freedom, the universal destination of created goods, work, solidarity, the principle of subsidiarity, the preferential option for the poor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the whole report is in a sense built round that theme of the central preferential option for the poor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">conservation, the failure of centrally planned economies and the dangers of consumerism . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Bishop Brennan, when he was introducing this report to a meeting I was at a couple of weeks ago, said that his father used to teach him that there were two evils in the world&mdash;the evil of communism and the evil of capitalism. As chairman of the committee, he was in a sense capturing humorously what is the nature of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a dispassionate report. It is not a partisan report. It is not one that attempts to take a doctrinaire view about political or economic systems. Rather, it is a report which is entirely and strongly committed to the preferential option for the poor. As such, it draws attention to problems in our society such as the growth of inequality. It says, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that ours was no longer the land of the fair go;</PARA>
<PARA>We imagine ourselves to be an egalitarian society but in fact we no longer are. One example it gives is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">nearly 700,000 children are living in homes where nobody has an income-producing job. </PARA>
<PARA>Further over it gives the figures for the distribution of wealth in Australia. It points out that the wealthiest one per cent of adult individuals hold about 25 per cent of private wealth&mdash;one per cent hold 25 per cent of private wealth. The top 5 per cent hold half of all the national wealth. The top 10 per cent hold 60 per cent of the wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hardly needs to say any more to demonstrate that we do not live in an equitable society. In fact, a recent report from the United Nations in a survey of Western countries shows that Australia, in its estimation, has the least equitable distribution of income of any Western country. It is totally contrary to our image of ourselves, but that is the conclusion of a rigorous statistical analysis by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes a whole series of practical recommendations and I would like to summarise these in the time I have. It begins by pointing out the enormous global inequality of wealth and talks about the importance of Australia building up our overseas aid, of encouraging the removal of the debt mountain in the Third World, and of enabling developing countries to grow faster through technology transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then moves on to domestic problems in Australia. It talks about the need to scrutinise the financial system more carefully and to aim for worker participation in the ownership and management of companies, something for which the Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), has worked in the past. It then talks about employment. It describes the central goal of full employment, a job for everyone who wants to work, as being profoundly important and outlines some practical policies for moving towards that goal. It gives a lot of attention to those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses housing, and talks about the value of home ownership as a means of increasing personal security and independence, and the need to encourage that by keeping interest rates low, reducing the cost of housing affordability, increasing the provision of emergency housing, and building up the concept of social housing. Of course, that concept was one of the central initiatives in the area of housing in the Budget this year. It talks about the need to build up the social security system, and points out that Australia spends less on social security than most other Western countries, and that there is therefore a case for extending the system in well targeted ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the facts about our social security system is that it is excellently targeted; but it could, of course, become more generous. The report discusses the value of a progressive, redistributive tax system and it talks about building up the progressiveness of the tax system, and about the danger of flat rate tax systems which remove that progressive and redistributive element. It discusses the health service and ways of building that up. It discusses the need to increase funding for non-government schools and for government schools&mdash;both of which I personally support&mdash;and also mentions the value of increasing social justice teaching in Catholic schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses the need to direct policies to strengthening family life, and it ends with a recommendation that the Government should set up an inquiry, into the distribution of wealth in Australia, to be completed by 1994-95, a recommendation which I strongly support. Acceptance, by us all, and implementation of this report would transform Australian society into a peaceful, just and equitable community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> presents us with a vision to which we can all respond.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context which has emerged&mdash;things were different at the time the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) gave notice of his motion on 17 September last&mdash;I would urge that, although the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> is, as I have said, a superior one, the motion should read `That this House notes the statement', and I hope the mover would accept that. That, at least, is the sense in which I and my colleagues on this side of the House would go along with the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking part in this debate, I should perhaps declare that I am a committed Christian, acknowledging Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, and I am a past President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship in this place, as indeed is the honourable member for Fraser, and a practising member of the Uniting Church. As I affirmed in a radio debate on this matter last Sunday night, on the ABC John Cleary program with the honourable member, the Church and church people do, of course, have the right to express views on issues of public policy and, indeed, on any matter. They are, in Charles Colson's terms, citizens of the kingdoms of this world as well as citizens of the Kingdom of God. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is incumbent upon people to make a real effort to see the whole thing they would comment upon or criticise&mdash;for example, that a comprehensive compensation program especially for the poor would be part and parcel of the coalition's proposal for a GST on food. Further, outside their field of `expertise'&mdash;namely, the proclaiming of the Good News and issues of ethics and morality&mdash;I say in parenthesis, it would have been good if the churches had spoken out more strongly about the excesses of greed, from the `paper entrepreneurs' to the woolgrowers, in the second half of the 1980s. I have always been of the view that the free enterprise system can function effectively only with the strong underpinning of the Judeo-Christian ethic, which is essentially the ethic of all the great religions. Outside their field of expertise, churchmen cannot speak with any special authority. I heard Professor Alan Walters, an active Christian and a long time adviser to British governments, saying on radio just this week, `The churches'&mdash;referring to Britain&mdash;`talk enormous nonsense about economics'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good,</EMPHASIS> after an instructive exposition&mdash;for someone like me from a different tradition&mdash;of Catholic social teaching and its biblical basis, as referred to by the honourable member, the book catalogues the appalling, unconscionable disparities in wealth and income, both on the world scene and in this country. The focus then is on the poor, as befits the undoubted Christian imperative of concern for the poor, and on their deprivation, the despair and hopelessness, the harsh realities of poverty. The honourable member refers to the disparities in the distribution of wealth and income. We have a situation where the lowest 20 per cent of income units gets about 4.5 per cent of the total income of Australians, against about 46.7 per cent for the highest 20 per cent. As to wealth, I recognise the position the honourable member is putting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this book the bogey of so-called `economic rationalism' gets a fair share of the blame&mdash;at least for the deterioration, the increasing inequality from 1982 to 1988-89 under the Hawke-Keating Government. In respect of `economic rationalism' at page 37 there is a leap in the argument. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effects of economic rationalism are already evident&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and without further argument asserts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results include the current totally unacceptable levels of unemployment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would have no quarrel with the view that high and still rising unemployment is the major cause of increased social hardship in Australia in recent years. But to attribute that to `economic rationalism'&mdash;whatever that might mean, as distinct from what has always been orthodox-mainstream economics&mdash;is unreal, ideological obscurantism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that `the recession you had to have', with its 1 1/2 million unemployed and underemployed people, was brought on in this country by the deliberate but unwise policy of business interest rates greater than 20 per cent for over a year. That proposition commands more general acceptance among professional economists, financial journalists and business commentators than any other aspect of our recent economic history. The mass of Australians out there are not going to let the present Government off the hook for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move to part two of the statement&mdash;I suspect there is some different authorship here&mdash;the bishops put forward a considerable array of recommendations for action: some 52 in all by my count. This side of the House would be in agreement with many of them. As I have said, they are focused on the lot of the poor. That is fair enough; that is the stated purpose of the exercise. But we really have to enlarge our view of what has to be confronted if we are to get a proper appreciation of the magnitude of the challenge that confronts this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central recommendation is No. 1 on page 98, in the key section under the heading `Employment'. The recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That governments at all levels . . . pursue policies which will lead to the creation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I would say the generation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of jobs, especially for the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! We agree, but what policies? And what other outcomes have to be met, along with the generation of jobs&mdash;two million of them&mdash;to give a reasonable degree of full employment by the year 2000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other outcomes have to be considered. The one is to arrest the slip that has occurred over recent years in the average standard of living. Adjusted for inflation, average weekly earnings have fallen about 5 per cent. While the bishops agree that it is good for women to have the right to work, they recognise rightly that many are obliged to do so just to adequately support their families. The other of the two outcomes I referred to is the need to come to grips with our vast, disabling and increasing foreign debt. In aggregate, it is the second largest debt in the world, of countries of any size. It simply is not on to go on borrowing to pay the interest, as we now are. It is a scandal for a developed country to have borrowed and to be borrowing so much. It is currently in the order of about $1 billion a month or about $50m a day. We have gone an $50m extra into hock between this time yesterday and this time today. It is a scandal for that to happen in a world&mdash;especially the poor developing world&mdash;crying out for capital and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Cleary, moderating the debate between the honourable member for Fraser and myself on ABC radio last Sunday night, put it to us that it was a matter of a choice: efficiency or equity. My response to that is: why not efficiency and equity? It is not contrary to doctrine to recognise the creation as well as the distribution of income and wealth. Equity&mdash;distribution or redistribution&mdash;puts the focus on dividing up more equitably the national cake as it is. What we have to do, especially with the imperative of coming to terms with the vast foreign debt, is to aim at having a bigger cake and dividing that up more equitably. That is the essence of our approach on this side of the House in the Fightback package. What this country needs is more honest leadership to tell the people how it is and to give Australia the vision, the motive and the resolve to respond. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the context of this debate and the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), I think it is important that some of the message of the statement be placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, and I intend to do that in my seconding of this motion. I would like to thank the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for putting the motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I believe the document is extremely important as a social commentary on the Australian situation regarding wealth and distribution of wealth and other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>, as has already been said, is a pastoral statement on the distribution of wealth in Australia issued by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference in September 1992. It is a timely, thoughtful and pertinent contribution to community consideration of the shape of our society now and into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the bishops on the comprehensiveness of their inquiry over five years, as the honourable member for Fraser has, and on the perceptiveness of their findings, which I might say must have taken some courage to present. I acknowledge the goodwill with which it is presented, and the extensiveness of the consultations undertaken in the course of its formulation. It is certainly an important foundation document on the values exhibited in our society at the present time and a doctrine on those to which we ought to be aspiring. In the forward to the statement Cardinal Clancy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consider that the churches are well placed to comment on socio-economic developments, and in particular to call for the insertion of moral values into the debate; to advocate a more explicit recognition by decision-makers that their policies require an ethical basis; and to urge members of the community at every level, inspired by the idea of solidarity, to promote the common good by taking remedial action against injustice and inequity.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that that is something that this Parliament can agree to and endorse. However, Cardinal Clancy also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Church leaders speak on these matters, one must distinguish between the presentation of doctrinal principles, where teaching authority is invoked, and the offering of contingent judgements on real life situations, where the possibility of differences in viewpoint among believers exists.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can also endorse that statement. In other words, the Cardinal is acknowledging that the document is not divine teaching on the Scriptures, but rather considered opinion on topical, social and economic questions which has been informed by the Scriptures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, nevertheless, a legitimate and articulate viewpoint which ought not be belittled by those who do not agree with it in its entirety. The Cardinal goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message of `common wealth for the common good' is both spiritual and practical&mdash;a call to the kind of inner conversion that will lead to action in support of a more just society. Since there is more to life than material possessions, the Church promotes a values system that gives priority to an appropriate relationship with God and to spiritual values. This should, however, contribute to the transformation of society. All of us have a continuing need for daily conversion or change of heart and a christian's action for social justice must be spiritually based if it is to be fruitful in the true sense.</PARA>
<PARA>The bishops themselves point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our intention has been in the first place to present the vision of Jesus&mdash;God's vision&mdash;on the world and earthly goods in such a way as to show that accumulating wealth for its own sake, and in disregard of the needs of others, is contrary to God's vision of what human life is meant to be and is the source of conflict, inequality and oppression; and in the second place to suggest some practical ways of overcoming or attempting to overcome the resultant inequality.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear! hear! I say. The bishops continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A statement on wealth distribution should also take note of the recent and current public discussion, stimulated by the announced economic plans of the major political parties, about such matters as the move towards universal superannuation, taxation reform (including the question of a consumption tax), tariff reductions, industrial deregulation and immigration. While it is beyond the scope of this publication to offer a comprehensive treatment of these subjects, some attention is given to the philosophies or value systems behind the policies being advocated or implemented in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, I think the bishops have clearly stated that they believe in the Church's right and responsibility to comment on these questions, taking into account the philosophies and value systems which underlie the policies of existing political parties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Berowra said, the bishops do comment on the influence of economic rationalism. I have no particular comment to make on that  except to say that it has had considerable impact on recent and current thinking in economic terms; sadly, I believe, because I think it has changed the emphasis in Australia to a large degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on the role of the Church in the community is also discussed at some length in the document. The bishops refer in this regard to the comments of Stanley Hauerwas, a social ethicist. They go on to define common wealth in the Australian context:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its widest sense, however, the idea of a commonwealth refers to a society founded on its shared wealth, where wealth is broadly understood. It includes notions of our common possessions or heritage and the general welfare and well-being of the whole population . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the message of the statement can be reduced to a few sentences, it is as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Gospel-based values widely accepted by those who work from a Christian perspective to attain a just society include a recognition of the essential dignity of all persons, the need to work for the common good, and our duty to stand alongside poor people and to try to ensure that they are treated justly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That ours is not a just society is apparent from the great and increasing inequality of wealth and income in Australia, the presence of serious poverty, unemployment and homelessness, and the growth of what is commonly called an `underclass' of gravely disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bible does not support the kind of thinking that would claim that religion is concerned exclusively with things of the spirit or with another world and another life, and not with this world and its material goods. The Christian religion is, of course, rightly concerned with spiritual values, faith and eternal life, but it does not distance itself from the business of living in this world. The two are inextricably bound together.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can all agree on those things and I think we should all agree on them. The bishops continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Gospel shows that Jesus lived and preached a radical attitude towards wealth and possessions. He proclaimed by word and example that to be a disciple involves being willing to give up one's wealth and share it with those who are poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parables of `the pearl of great value' and `the hidden treasure' convey to Jesus' listeners the incomparable worth of the reign of God. Here and now, living by the values of God's reign is an invitation to radical conversion so that, imitating the love and justice of God, our attitude to God and to power, prestige and possessions is changed, and Jesus' promise to bring the fullness of life is accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA>There are some people in our society who forget that `wealth for wealth's sake' is not right and that we should all be prepared to share. The bishops go on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his other words and actions Jesus made it abundantly clear that he stood by the poor and the outcasts. Eventually he was to die as one of them.</PARA>
<PARA>The clash between solidarity and individual greed is a central plank of this particular project by the bishops. They say, on page 10 of the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sole criterion for entry into eternal life is our treatment of the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the imprisoned, with all of whom Jesus identifies himself.</PARA>
<PARA>Christian or not, I think that people in this Parliament should be bearing those words in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 6 of the document concentrates on imbalances in the distribution of wealth and, as the honourable member for Fraser has already commented, there are extensive recommendations concerning all aspects of our society. I would ask the House to endorse this statement of principle and doctrine by the bishops.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this debate today because I believe that the opportunity which is afforded to the House by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in bringing on this motion for debate in private members' business is a very appropriate and relevant one. I am also very appreciative and supportive of most of the comments made by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate today, though, opens up a far broader debate which we ought to be having in this country. It is a debate not just about the efficiency of how we generate wealth in the country but also about how we care and have compassion for our fellow man. If this debate serves to do that, it will be a most welcome debate in Australia's history, because there has been a focus on economics alone without the due prominence given to the other aspects which are raised in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been quoted two or three times already, but I want to go back to the quote that the common good cannot be served unless appropriate attention is given to the ethical and moral dimensions of economic, social and political questions. I say amen to that and concur absolutely with it. It is vital to the health of this great country of ours that we weld those thoughts together and that, as members of parliament, we give an equal emphasis to each of those aspects: the ethical, the moral, the economic, the social and the political. I would also add the spiritual. These are the dimensions of all people. If you take only one of those dimensions, such as the political, the social, the economic, the moral or ethical, or the spiritual, things get out of balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that this document is on the agenda in the national Parliament of Australia. Instead of the Parliament endorsing it, I think we should note it, but take it on board very seriously. I have not had time to go through this document and cross the t's and dot the i's, but I think if we were to endorse every document that came before us we could lock ourselves into a position without having taken in information from other organisations and people. This is one document which should contribute to our ideas. I think it contributes significantly to our ideas in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words `rational economics' have been brought into this debate, and so I want to address briefly both that concept and the Fightback package. I am glad that we can have an honest and open debate here this morning on this issue. I am glad that almost a bipartisan approach to this issue is developing. That is good. I see rational economics&mdash;and I know that it is just a terminology&mdash;as the most efficient way of generating wealth. Other people might have a different view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As wealth is generated, as a bigger cake of activity is created in the nation&mdash;and hopefully in the world&mdash;it is to be hoped that on top of that cake there will be more cream. It is what we do with the cream on top of the cake that really counts in terms of redistributing the wealth that is generated&mdash;but the wealth has to be generated in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting aspects of reading the Scriptures is finding that in the early days the Christian people got together and shared in common, as we are told in `Acts'. The interesting thing about that is that they then somehow lost out. No doubt they had created their wealth before they shared it in common. However, then they started to distribute the wealth without thinking about how they would continue to create more wealth. That is a fascinating aspect of the Scriptures. There is a balance in these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at the same time as redistributing the wealth, the healthy, the active, the creative and the people who have been blessed genetically and socially with more opportunities have an obligation to care and to show compassion for those people who are not so well off. I think that is what this document is about, but it has to be a balanced one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a professing Christian in this place, I see the Fightback package as the best plan of action so far that brings together a genuine attempt to help create wealth and to redistribute it. It is very important that we think about both aspects of that equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> also says that the church's spiritual and humanitarian mission involves Christians at the very heart of the struggle for human development and progress. I agree with that entirely but, as the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) said, Bishop Clancy also distinguishes between the presentation of doctrinal matters and those matters which are contingent on judgments. This presents us, as members of parliament, with having to make judgments. Of course, this is where we get into difficulty because of the different views on how to make those judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 50 or so recommendations in this report, and I fully concur with the overwhelming majority of them. I have looked at education, families and Aborigines in a little bit more detail. In this country of ours, there is abject poverty out there amongst our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. It is a great sadness that in a country so rich and so wonderfully endowed by God the Creator, we have not been able to bring about a harmonious sense of justice in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great need for clear thinking on the distinction between the role of government and the role of churches. There has in recent days been a little criticism from the churches of the way in which we in this House&mdash;I think on both sides of the House&mdash;have been governing Australia. I want to say to the churches&mdash;not just to the Catholic Church, the Uniting Church or the Anglican Church but to all those people involved in church work in Australia&mdash;that they also have a deep obligation to this country to ensure that the gospel is spread far and wide so that there can be an ethical basis on which we can administer this country. One of the great difficulties for us in this Parliament is that there is not a common ethic which we can assume is part of people's lives. I put that out as a challenge to everybody interested in the spiritual, ethical and moral aspects of life in Australia. Government and church work really are a partnership in this country, and the churches have to try to ensure that there is a moral framework on which we can administer this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the point that we have an obligation as people to work, to rest and to be charitable, and I believe that is what this document is largely about. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

To me, it gave a clear foundation of what politics are about and what politicians are supposed to be here for, and I fully endorse what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> is recommending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few weeks we have had a number of contributions, particularly from the Catholic Church but also from a number of other churches in Australia, which some have seen as unwelcome intrusions into the political debate but which for me have been a very important contribution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> certainly cannot be considered in any way a partisan document. It certainly tells us where the Government, which has been in charge of this country for nine or 10 years, has not delivered the goods the way it should have. It makes justified criticisms of us, but it also makes fully justified criticisms of some of the alternative policies that have been presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to get into any partisan debate today. I think it has been a good debate as the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) said, but I must respond to one of the comments he made. He said that Fightback comes out of this document looking very good. I know I am a bit biased given that I sit on this side of the House but I certainly saw the principles that are espoused in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> as very much against what Fightback is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> and when I listened to some of the contributions made by honourable members opposite in espousing the virtues of Fightback, I thought they pursued the ideology that the needs and desires and rights of the individual tend to be more important than the needs of the community. If one reads Catholic social teachings and understands the principles that are behind <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good </EMPHASIS>and behind the documents that have been produced recently by the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, one understands that they talk about the importance of the freedom of the individual to operate within society and the rights of the individual, but they also make the very important point that that freedom is very much limited by what is important for the whole community and how we, as a community, should work together to support each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly draw attention to the fact that one of the fundamental principles of Catholic social teaching is the importance of government and the work of government through things such as taxation and income redistribution to redistribute the wealth of the community to all so that all get a fair share. I do not be believe that Fightback achieves that. I believe that if one looks at a lot of the analyses of Fightback, what Fightback does is redistribute income away from the poorer sections of the community to the wealthier sections. I think that is very much against the principles behind <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about some of the principles that do underlie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> because, as I said, they are very important principles that all of us in this Parliament should endorse and should be committed to. I might just list a few of them. The first one is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A just society is one in which no one's rights are ignored, denied or sacrificed to another's advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important and I think that would be commonly shared by all honourable members of this House. It is in the implementation of that principle where we tend to differ. The second principle is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">freedom as a basic human right.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to look at what that freedom means. Freedom does not just mean freedom to vote in elections or freedom to move around or freedom to express points of view. It means freedom to raise one's family, freedom to live with human dignity, to be free from poverty, to have the opportunity to work, to raise one's family and to live as a member of the community in good health and with a decent standard of living. It is our role as a government and as a parliament to try to ensure that all members of our community enjoy that right and that freedom. The third important principle behind this document is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The freedom of one person is, however, necessarily limited by the rights of others.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why we enact laws in this community. We want to ensure that people understand that within their rights as individuals they must also respect the rights of others. The fourth principle is the right to private property. The Catholic Church does not believe that all wealth really belongs to the State. The Church supports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the right to private property, but this is limited by the need to use it for the benefit of others as well as oneself.</PARA>
<PARA>The fifth principle, and I think the most telling principle that I find in this document and one which I think is one of the areas where there is a clear distinction between what honourable members on this side of the House support and what honourable members on the others side of the House support, is the question of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the essential dignity and human rights of workers which employers must recognise.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important principle because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means the right to share in the fruit of their labour. While the making of profit is legitimate within certain limits, enterprises must not be run for the profit motive alone. People are more important than profits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fundamental principle that directs the beliefs of those on this side of the House with regard to industrial relations and the rights of workers to get their fair share. The sixth principle, which is a very important one as well, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">those who are more influential, because they have a greater share of goods and common services, should feel responsible for the weaker and be ready to share with them all they possess.</PARA>
<PARA>Just a few days ago, I had the pleasure and opportunity to discuss the principles behind the Government's social justice strategy with some members of the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. They pointed out to us in that discussion the weaknesses they saw in our social justice strategy. They felt that we were heading in the right direction in some areas, but that we also had fallen for the trap of believing that the individual is more important than the society; that some of the language we have used talks about the need to protect the rights of individuals within society but that sometimes we, by doing that, are ignoring the common good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Commission also pointed out that, where there are people who have much less in society&mdash;whether because of physical disability, their situation, their wealth situation or their opportunity to participate in employment&mdash;we need to distort the benefits and the contribution of government to advantage them. We need to positively discriminate in the distribution of our resources in favour of those people, not just say, `We've got to have an open society where everybody gets a fair chance and we've got equality of opportunity, and if you don't make use of that equality of opportunity that's tough bickies for you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Commission said that we need to positively discriminate in the distribution of our wealth and the resources of our community to help those who have the least opportunities. Again, that is not something that is espoused in Fightback. I do not think we, on this side of the House, have actually done that as much as we should have. I think there are some glaring omissions in the delivery of our services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with physical and intellectual disabilities. We have come some way, but we have a long way to go in trying to assist those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh principle is that, in attempting to understand the poor, we need to understand the way the poor and the disadvantaged see the world and their situation. We should start to look at the world from their position. We should start to try to meet their needs as they see them, rather than decide what we think is good for people and impose that upon them. For too long that has been a problem we have had with the delivery of government services. We tend to think we know better than the people we are trying to help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important principle is that it is completely unacceptable for some inhabitants of the earth to take more than they need, while others lack the most basic necessities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>, by the Australian Catholic bishops, raises concerns&mdash;which are heartily endorsed by the coalition&mdash;about the increasing polarisation of Australian society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> painted a bleak picture of Australia over the past 10 years. While the bishops have refrained from entering the political fray, it has to be said that the social snapshot provided by this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>, is no ringing endorsement for the policies of the present Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House a thumbnail sketch of the picture provided in the bishops' document. In 1982-83 the income of the top one per cent of income earners equalled the total earnings of the bottom 11 per cent. By 1988-89 the top one per cent were earning an amount equal to the total incomes of the bottom 21 per cent. That is the conclusion of the Macquarie University researcher Marc Lombard, who completed a study of Australian Taxation Office figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of other corroborative studies. A study by Phil Raskall, as part of the inequality project conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, found that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers. They have suffered a 20 per cent drop in their share of national income since 1975, while well-off families have increased their share by 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Dr Ann Harding, of the Department of Social Security, shows that under the Hawke Government the incomes of most social security recipients increased by a much higher percentage than the incomes of most wage and salary earners. But&mdash;and it is a big but&mdash;most of these people remain in the poor category, even after receiving the increase. Robert Gregory, Professor of Economics at the ANU Research School of Social Sciences, has found that the number of low and high income earners in this country has grown significantly, while the number of middle income earners has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most remarkable of all&mdash;given that we are talking about the policies of a Labor government, which is theoretically supposed to be protecting the little people, the workers&mdash;in the period between 1983 and 1989, 10 per cent of the national income was taken away from the workers and given to the owners of capital. This, as the report notes, was `a massive redistribution between the social classes'. The reason is that wage restraint has kept down the incomes of workers while there has been no restraint on incomes from profits, rents and interest. High rents only exacerbated the problems of workers&mdash;Labor's so-called heartland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of this is that in the last 10 years Australia has become less equal than the United Kingdom. Of eight developed countries, we are now only more equal than Germany and the United States. Peter Saunders, the director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, concluded that the share of income going to the 60 per cent of families in the middle to low bracket in Australia was smaller than in any other countries he studied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor likes to trumpet its achievements for women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS> comments on the number of women having to become the family's second income earner in order to make ends meet: the feminisation of poverty. At least 50 per cent of sole parent families in Australia which are headed by women live in poverty. While the percentage of women in the work force has increased, women have gone into the work force to do the lowly paid jobs and, dare I say it, the dead end jobs which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) eschews for our youth. In the last 10 to 20 years there has been no corresponding increase in the number of senior or highly paid positions held by women. Only 3 per cent of the members of Australia's top 158 company boards are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the more than 200,000 households who are waiting for public housing. For people on average weekly earnings, the cost of entry to home ownership doubled between 1983 and 1988. The Brotherhood of St Laurence estimates that 100,000 people live in caravan parks because they cannot afford to live anywhere else. There is the 11 per cent of our work force who are unemployed. Our gross foreign debt has grown from $15 billion in 1981 to $183 billion in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bishops produced an honest statement about the condition of Australia today. It was the coalition's corresponding concern that led to the formation of the Fightback plan for change. When we look at the hardship which Australians are now suffering&mdash;a hardship which is hardly reflected in the statistics, which do not tell us about the misery and lack of hope that people feel at being unemployed or underemployed, or having their wages drastically cut&mdash;we have to see a link between economic mismanagement and social distress. We cannot blame it all on the global mess. The coalition is committed to alleviating that distress, and pulling the economic levers is just one of the ways of achieving that. It is not the only way. We stand by income support programs for the disadvantaged administered by the Government, recognising that markets are not infallible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian bishops stated that `wealth creation and economic growth are not, in themselves, either socially good or evil'. They said further, `This document is not opposed to the creation of wealth in itself'&mdash;a matter not mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), or by other speakers on behalf of the Government. The Catholic Church's approach to social justice is summed up in the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity. The current Pope stresses these principles in his encyclical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centesimus Annus</EMPHASIS>, which we might refer to the honourable member for Moreton. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the social `welfare' state leads to a loss of human energies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients, and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the bishops' statement there has been a frenzy of sometimes ill-informed comments by other church people. Common to all the church statements, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common wealth for the common good</EMPHASIS>, is a failure to address the business of the creation of wealth. If you remember the Bible story, the master gave a talent to three servants to keep for him and at the end of some time he returned to collect. The person who had only what had been given to him because he had hidden it under a bushel for safekeeping he was not pleased with. It was the servant who had invested it and created more talents who was to be commended. If everyone were given the same amount of money, all would not end up equal because some would sit on it, some would squander it and others would use it productively. So there will also be inequality but, unless the wealth producers are encouraged, there will be no surplus for redistribution by government to the needy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly saddening was the attack in recent days on the coalition policy of the GST by the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> pointed out that the Commission failed to say why taxing food is immoral but taxing income to buy food is not. It failed to take into account payroll tax, which increases the price of food and which the coalition would abolish. It fails to take into account all the other taxes which create a cascade effect, raising the prices of all our consumables. It did not mention the wholesale sales taxes, which already applies to a range of foods and drink and ordinary household items at rates of up to 30 per cent. It failed to mention that the State governments tax the very water which we use. It failed to mention that there is a value added tax on food and drink in Catholic countries such as Italy. In all, it was so selective as to be extraordinarily biased and political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Commission demeaned the church with this document, it has placed in jeopardy the credibility of everything else the church may wish to say about matters of public importance. Indeed, the church runs the risk of becoming irrelevant in public debate while it publishes such obviously second rate and biased material. What is more appalling is the use which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been prepared to make of the document. As many serious commentators remarked, his references to Catholic tribalism and bashing priests come closer to refostering the bitter sectarian divisions of the past then anything else uttered in the last 30 years. </PARA>

<PARA>Rather than draw on Adam Smith and David Ricardo, names associated with early free market thinking, economic rationalists have become heavily reliant on the power of sporting metaphor to convince us as to the veracity of their position. The image of a lean and hungry athlete seeking international competitiveness on a level playing field has emerged as the personification of a new, deregulated Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of the 1980s, the former heroes of the new deregulated Australia were on the run and a new debate was in the air. Chastened by the Wills by-election and sounding a bit like an old fashioned protectionist, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) began talking about effective rather than nominal rates of protection. Unfortunately, tariffs are only part of the equation. Before too long Robert Manne of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> joined Kenneth Davidson of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in railing against economic rationalism and the free traders, and the Catholic bishops began to talk unfavourably about the GST. In the interim the USA, a free trade icon, aware that tariffs are only part of the story, dropped a bundle of cash on the wheat belt. Although such a subsidy involved no contravention of the GATT agreement, it reinforced the growing belief that the level playing field was tilted and the free trade model flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the use of non-tariff barriers has increased in scale. Voluntary export restraints, the use of product standards, the Multi-fibre Agreement and cultural loyalty are just some of the means by which countries have overcome the theoretical problems of free trade. The French, for example, do not object to the importation of Japanese video recorders as long as they are imported through a small village in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) looks inward and places his hopes on a deregulated labour market and what some would see as a return to the kind of freedom of contract which brought about the mass strikes by shearers, miners and maritime workers in the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what the honourable member for Bennelong implies, working people and wages are not the problem. Freeing up the market, which is little more than a euphemism for reducing wages, offers a one-sided solution. Instead of clinging to a naive faith in the market, we should enact policies designed to protect and improve our manufacturing base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that the imposition of tariffs is essentially inflationary, costly or inefficient in no way takes into account the costs associated with our increasing overseas debt. In a submission to the Spindler independent parliamentary inquiry into tariffs and industry development in August 1992, Arthur Gibbs pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ignore this hidden tax on the community, which more than offsets the consumer benefits, without even considering any unemployment effects, is to ignore the price of borrowing to pay for imports we could not afford in the past and will be less able to afford in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission, a defender of the removal of tariffs, noted that assistance to manufacturing industries in 1988-89 was $7.7 billion. It saw fit to ignore the fact that in the same year we spent $9.5 billion servicing our net external debt. By 1990-91 the interest payment on overseas debt had risen to $12.8 billion. The advantages are far outweighed by the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As early as 1979 in an ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guest of Honour</EMPHASIS> talk, Ted Wheelwright painted a gloomy picture of Australia's future should it adhere to the free trade philosophy. About these developments he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great contemporary catchcry is for deregulation and for letting market forces work. This emanates from the USA and it is quite clear that the main force behind this movement is the giant corporation, especially the multi-national.</PARA>
<PARA>As Wheelwright pointed out back in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as far as capital is concerned it is far more profitable to set up factories in the export zones of South East Asia where multi-nationals can bring in the latest equipment tax free and import the products of cheap labour havens into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The consequences of these policies, a contracting manufacturing sector, high unemployment and cuts to the public sector&mdash;consequences identified by Wheelwright&mdash;have come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, bastion of the very free trade policies which threaten our industrial base, saw fit to carry a number of articles in Tuesday's edition apparently lamenting the proposed takeover of Arnotts by the US food giant Campbell soup company. I have never eaten an Iced Vo Vo, but those who enjoy them might like to think about the relationship between free trade and the transformation of a home-grown delicacy into a cookie. The fact that economic recovery and reduction of our foreign debt is partly dependent on acquiring foreign investment, with all its ramifications, has been totally ignored, as has any examination of the efficacy, cultural or otherwise, of foreign takeovers. Wheelwright's essay ended with a salutary reminder:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has only survived as a nation because it has been able to offset market forces, both internally and internationally. To remove the offsets is to risk the country becoming the biggest open cut export platform in the world, in which most of the wealth accrues to the owners of foreign capital; small business is decimated; and a large part of the workforce is made redundant. Internally it is to risk national disintegration as the resource rich states of Western Australia and Queensland come to have more in common with foreign markets and foreign capital than with Canberra, and Tasmania and South Australia begin to depopulate, as their economies stagnate.</PARA>
<PARA>Although Wheelwright left out Victoria, recent statements by Arvi Parbo and Hugh Morgan suggest he was not far off the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Ross Garnaut, the high priest of recent economic policy, sees things differently. Garnaut sees the export of primary produce and services and the importation of tourists, rather than the development of manufacturing, where he believes we have no comparative advantage, as the way forward. Clive Hamilton, however, in his paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Does Free Trade Produce the Goods</EMPHASIS> responded by pointing out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparative advantage is an inherently dynamic concept and is determined by the decisions of individuals, firms and governments.</PARA>
<PARA>We need only look as far as Japan, which, as Professor Peter Self in the Gibbs paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . did not become a technological and economic giant by this route&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by leaving it to the market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but through government carefully targeting export markets and protecting its industries by hook or by crook.</PARA>
<PARA>The defenders of economic rationalism might want to push on and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) may choose to cite the growth in exports as evidence that this economic model has a future, but projections of continued high unemployment leave us wondering. Even the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, is far from convinced that current economic policy can overcome the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasing foreign indebtedness, unemployment and import penetration indicate that the free trade approach is a high risk strategy. As the ACTU noted in its 15 July national employment strategy paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic management would be more sophisticated and the program of change more secure and sustainable where the trigger for each next step in the tariff reduction schedule is provided not by an arbitrary date, but by a direct and explicit linkage with the ultimate goal of the whole exercise&mdash;jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Our arbitrary commitment to tariff reduction continues oblivious to economic circumstances. These economic circumstances include a massive increase in imports, up from 9 per cent in 1983 to 14.5 per cent of domestic demand in 1991. The ANU's Dr Jenny Stewart, a strong critic of current industry policy, reminds us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have powerful techniques for influencing demand and are able to protect infant industries from imports and use their own purchasing power in a co-ordinated way to develop firms from which they buy.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Stewart continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, Australian bureaucracies are often loathe to buy the products that businesses produce, even when they are as good as imports.</PARA>
<PARA>One anecdote does not prove the point but it might provide an insight. THYCON, a 100 per cent Australian owned private designer and manufacturer of static power conversion products, a company operating in my own electorate, appears to have been a victim of this kind of bureaucratic thinking. THYCON management recently brought to my attention the fact that the company had been overlooked in favour of overseas companies in relation to a number of tenders it had submitted to Federal departments. That a high-tech company whose quality was indisputable and price more than competitive should have lost out to an overseas company leaves one wondering what the cultural framework for determining such decisions actually is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such decisions fly in the face of those standard cliches, such as `rigours of international competition', `best practice' and the like&mdash;cliches used by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in his defence of free trade during last evening's Customs Tariffs Amendment Bill debate. Although the honourable member for Barker was keen to put forward the proposition that the removal of protection would aid agricultural industries, it is clear that many in the coalition, especially the canegrowers, do not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing `unclever' about the selective use of tariffs and quotas. The Government, to its credit, has made a commitment to the car industry, although some in the industry believe a tariff level of 15 per cent by the year 2000 is still too low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the evidence shows that clever countries, Japan for example, have had the political will to foster particular industries. One should also ask whether the mining industry could have reached its present level of competitiveness without an assortment of tax concessions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. This motion really calls for a change in the set of economic policies pursued by the Government since 1983 and it is a recognition that unemployment is the most important issue facing Australia. It is a recognition of the growing body of opinion across the country that the direction of economic policy is wrong. I suggest that it even reflects the majority view of this House. How could it be otherwise? With both major parties offering more of the same for the future, the realities that face Australia are record unemployment, record bankruptcies, inexorably escalating foreign debt, a collapsing rural sector, a shattered banking system, massive asset selling by Federal and State governments, increasing foreign ownership, increasing inequality of income, a continuing shift of the tax burden from the higher to lower income groups, and the establishment of a two-class society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No reputable analyst can envisage any substantial change in unemployment with either the Government or Opposition policies for the foreseeable future. The economic irrationalist set of policies that has led Australia to the present situation has produced much the same situation in the other countries in which it has been applied&mdash;the USA, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While governments must be expected to put the best face on the results of their policies, the unemployment situation and the prospects for the future are now so serious that the continuing presence of record job creation in the 1980s is almost contemptible. It is true that 1.5 million jobs were created in the 1983-1990 period. However, adjusted against the industrialised world's fastest rate of population growth and the growth of part time work, hours of work actually fell in that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, far from outperforming the comparable OECD countries in employment we lost ground. The 1980s saw a loss of full time jobs. As Professor Bob Gregory, an economist at the Australian National University and a member of the Reserve Bank Board, stated recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After adjusting for population growth, one in four full time male jobs has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the last two decades. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A job loss of this magnitude has never occurred before in our history.</PARA>
<PARA>Tom Burton said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sad commentary on our system of national government that there has been no serious public inquiry into the worst economic miscalculation since the War.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not much good the Government twisting and diving with statistical manipulation and bleating that the coalition policies will be worse than their own. Every intelligent observer knows that the coalition policies are only a more extreme version of the Government's. The fact is that these policies have failed and show no hope for the future. The fact is that, on the mythical level playing field, Australia cannot compete in any manufacturing industry because of the economies of scale that apply in Japan, Germany, USA and other large industrialised countries. We cannot compete with countries such as Indonesia and Korea or southern China because of their low wage levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot have training levies, superannuation levies, environmental laws, industrial laws, comparatively high levels of public expenditure on such things as health and education and still expect industry, no matter how efficient, to compete with emerging economies where none of these costs apply. All that will happen without protective mechanisms is that Australia will continue to export jobs, as more and more industries are forced to either close or relocate offshore. Despite what Mr Hugh Morgan thinks, we cannot compete with countries that have a virtually inexhaustible supply of low wage labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationalist mantra says that we must sacrifice virtually all manufacturing industry in the name of redeploying resources into areas in which we enjoy a comparative advantage. It claims that we must find some nirvana of high-tech niche markets that have eluded the rest of the world. It is a chant coming from self-interested groups and a few academic theorists with a sadistic streak, whose incomes are fully protected. As Gregory Clark has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people should be running evangelist schools not economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we can point to exceptions such as Switzerland or to the export success of Adelaide's alloy wheel manufacturing industry. But this is not Switzerland, and a few successful niche industries will only ever employ a very minor part of the work force. It is economic fundamentalism to continue to unilaterally remove all forms of protection from our manufacturing industry. It can only lead to further devastation of the Australian economy and eventually to social anarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inescapable fact is that Australia cannot survive on an efficient but low employment agricultural and mining sector and a high employment but largely non-productive services sector. The industrial giants and rural industries of Europe cannot survive without protection and neither can many Australian industries. Even the emerging tiger economies of Asia protect their economies with high tariffs, quotas and direct government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the Government has been following only a slightly milder version of Thatcherism, and I appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not to repeat Margaret Thatcher's final mistake when she said, `This lady's not for turning'. The UK today is the industrialised world's outstanding example of the failure of economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to abandon our high interest rate policies, which have sustained an artificially high exchange rate for the Australian dollar. The reliance on high interest rates has effectively subsidised imports and penalised exports while crushing business investment. It is no wonder that farmers are outraged that the Reserve Bank spends millions of dollars of public money artificially keeping up an overvalued dollar, reducing exports and increasing imports. What happened to the free market? Are the Reserve Bank's propping up of the dollar and the high interest rates and arbitrary intervention in the market not an intervention which locks in an overvalued dollar, which then in turn worsens the current account deficit and calls for even higher interest rates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a country with a chronic and steadily increasing foreign debt, there must be assistance to the tradeable sector of the economy&mdash;in particular, the rural and manufacturing sectors.

The non-traded sector of financial services and the vast range of professional services are sheltered from overseas competition. It can pass on costs and inflation and is largely non-productive. The exchange rate is the nexus between the two sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last decade the sectors have become massively unbalanced with employment reduction in the traded sector and a massive increase in employment in the non-traded sector. This situation can only be corrected by a lower exchange rate and selective protection of manufacturing industries. Other mechanisms such as credit controls and some re-regulation of the banking system to correct the 1980s orgy of foreign borrowing, company takeovers and asset stripping are also required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government constantly points to the increase in exports of complex manufacturing goods. It is certainly true that in 1980 such exports brought in $9 billion. At the same time, however, imports of manufactured goods totalled $32 billion. Any reliance on export of complex manufactured goods to solve foreign debt is futile in the present circumstances. Even with the largest item of manufactured exports, which is cars and transport valued at $2 billion, this is only possible because of the protection of the Button plan. As zero tariffs are approached, this car industry will disappear and exports will plummet. The car industry must be defended for three basic reasons: employment, overseas debt and to preserve an industrial base which, if it disappears, will be almost impossible to rebuild in any worthwhile time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flood of consumer goods, both manufacturing and agricultural, can never be stopped from foreign competitors with hugh economies of scale or minuscule wage rates. The textile, clothing and footwear sector has been squeezed to the limit. There have been substantial reforms and investment in new technology. Much of the industry is efficient, but there is no way it can compete with wage levels in Asia which are one-twentieth of ours. There is no way its largely migrant, female work force can effectively be retrained. Its future without protection is relocation to Asia, with most of the current work force providing a large increase in social services expenditure. The level playing field is a desert mirage, and for most people it is a case of protect or perish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to enter the debate on the motion put by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary). I commend him for providing the opportunity to broaden input on topics which, while they have become public currency, are often discussed in a misinformed manner&mdash;the much vaunted level playing field, tariff and quota reductions, and the protection of jobs in Australia's manufacturing base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too much public comment on tariff policy is made from a basis of misinformation. For instance, it is not uncommon to hear the decline of manufacturing cited as a direct consequence of tariff cuts, yet the statistics do not bear out this hypothesis. To the contrary, over the eight years to 1990-91 when tariff protection was gradually reduced, Australian manufacturing grew at an average rate of 2.5 per cent a year, while in the eight years to 1982-83, when tariffs were high, manufacturing grew at less than one per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that we, as a government, should turn our backs on the need to support the development of our manufacturing industry to a degree of efficiency such that it is not fatally threatened by open competition. Certainly, we should. The Government has clearly flagged its intention to do so, implementing a progressive series of supportive measures to build a more competitive Australia. We already have a much higher standard of Australian made goods than in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also moved to protect and create jobs, both in the short term as well as in the long term. Indeed, our selective retention of tariffs to prevent putting jobs at risk in certain industries in itself acknowledges that in some instances, particularly where all the players are not adhering to the same rules, the playing field certainly is not always level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has noted, some industries will always need protection. Under this Government they will get it, but this does not mean that Australia should not aim for a non-protectionist society in the long term, particularly if we are to strengthen our ties with similarly minded trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, in 1992, the tariff on imported clothing is 51 per cent. Under the gradual, annual reductions announced in 1992, the tariff will be 25 per cent in the year 2000. The tariff on imported motor cars in 1992 is 35 per cent. In the year 2000, it will be 15 per cent. General tariff rates, which are now 10 to 15 per cent, will come down to 5 per cent. At an international level, the playing field has obviously been distorted by the protectionist policies of the USA and the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we must not make the mistake of thinking that were we to retain tariffs on an open, non-selective basis, we would do the best thing by Australian industries and by Australians seeking job security in the long term. In fact, over the years, Australian people have paid very high prices for manufactured goods, compared with people in many other countries, because some manufacturers relied on tariffs to make their products competitive in the market place, instead of working to improve design and manufacturing skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, it would be wrong to assert that open slather retention of tariffs could miraculously halt high unemployment in the midst of any recession. A major cause of today's job loss is recession, and if we are to target policies to assist the jobless, we must face up to this fact. The Government did address this factor in One Nation and in the 1992-93 Budget. This response marks the difference between the Keating Government and the Hewson Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition policy is reactionary, showing a degree of inflexibility which augurs ill for Australians who expect legislation which is designed to fit the needs of people, rather than that which hurts people in a dogmatic application of unworkable theory. The contrast between the Government and coalition positions is clear. Labor is phasing tariffs down to 25 per cent for the clothing industry, 15 per cent for textiles, 15 per cent for cars and 5 per cent for most other industries. The coalition proposes zero for everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public debate regarding the effects of zero tariffs on the important car industry as a major employer of Australians is well recorded. Labor's phase down in tariffs to 15 per cent gives the automotive industry in Australia a chance to survive and grow, which zero tariffs do not. Government policy for the retention and development of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries have required specialised attention, with the industries experiencing trouble in adjusting to lower tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These industries do have a future; and the Labor Government has encouraged companies to survive against imports by the companies adopting a number of strategies to become market oriented, using the latest quick response manufacturing techniques; developing merchandise servicing; and operating globally while servicing the local market as part of their international strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government supports such companies through its TCF plan and the new initiatives announced in July 1992 by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. These initiatives include: increasing the ability of TCF firms to compete with imported products and to fight unfair trading practices; a better import credit scheme to increase exports; and a $30m boost to help TCF restructuring, taking the total available to $160m over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At zero tariff, both the old and the new TCF industries would be decimated. Changes to payroll tax and imposing a GST would not keep these industries viable. To the contrary, the application of a GST, particularly in conjunction with the coalition's devastating plan to destroy the Industrial Relations Commission, would create and prolong social injustice to workers and those who seek work, both in the manufacturing industry and in other industries cross Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations policy of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) would effectively lower wages, end the protection provided by unions and industrial tribunals, and deny government help for work reform. It would mean a massive shift in the balance of power from the IRC to employers. It would destroy the negotiating power of workers in relation to their employers, a move feared by any person, worker, employer or observer who wants to see the maintenance of industrial peace in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers in weak bargaining positions would be particularly at risk. These workers could be forced out of awards and forced to accept the minimum wage. Moreover, replacing the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;which the Leader of the Opposition wants to abolish&mdash;with individual employment contracts would mean that disputes could be settled only in the courts. This has the potential to incur massive legal costs. The disadvantaged financial position which these actions would leave Australian working people in would be painfully compounded by the application of a goods and services tax. With a final turn of the screw, a GST would push up the cost of union fees and legal services for workers who got into a dispute with their employer. The rejection by the coalition of the needs of Australian workers is emphasised when contrasting the treatment of the GST on employer association fees and legal costs for employers, which will be rebatable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Wills for providing another opportunity for concerned members of this House to debate issues central to the health of Australia's domestic and international marketplace, and therefore to consumers and job seekers. It is important in an issue such as this&mdash;particularly with unemployment being suffered by so many Australians&mdash;that points raised by members of all parties and by Independents, where they are valid points, be seriously considered in the interests of those Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while it is natural&mdash;indeed, it is the key role of members of the House of Representatives&mdash;to focus our attention on the immediate needs of our constituents, it is also important to remember that, while short term solutions should not be overlooked, and are often obviously essential to alleviating hurt, the best interests of our constituents can be advanced only by parallel action on long term policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I support my Government's policies to ensure that upcoming generations of Australians now out of work are supported and trained so that they do not become a lost generation, left behind when the economy picks up and when skilled Australians are needed to fill the job vacancies which will then become available. I saw that situation in earlier years&mdash;at the beginning of the 1980s. There was a dreadful unemployment situation then, when nothing was done to train the unemployed to fill the jobs which came up. We were then importing skilled trades people from other countries. So it is most important that, at this stage, we see that they have those skills. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate goes back to the free trade protectionist arguments of the 1860s, especially in Victoria. The debate was precipitated by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), particularly during the by-election when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) changed his stance in a public sense. It is quite clear where the Prime Minister stands. I quote from his ministerial statement of 12 March 1991, `Building a Competitive Australia':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within a couple of years, remaining non-tariff barriers will have been completely removed.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the position of the Prime Minister! It is clear and up-front that the Prime Minister and the Government stand for a lower protection regime. The Prime Minister did not make that statement on radio and off the cuff; it was a clear commitment to a lower tariff regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is occurring in the climate of 927,000 unemployed Australians and another 200,000 Australians under-employed. Of course, the arguments about tariff are fanned by members of the Government and by the Prime Minister to overcome the fundamental problems of unemployment. The simple protection argument, as those people out in the electorate understand, is that tariffs will protect Australia's workers from low wage countries around the world, and that tariffs will protect big factories&mdash;that is, those people working in the bigger industrial complexes will be protected by tariffs and their jobs may remain intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the 750,000 small businesses around Australia? Where is their protection and where is their political influence? If they put one person on or one person off, that will make a dramatic difference to the unemployment situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a perspective on the number of jobs involved in these industries compared with the total work force. We have a work force of 7.5 million persons in Australia, and this whole tariff debate revolves around 165,000 people in the motor car assembly industry and in the TCF industries. The concentration of these industries is in key marginal seats, particularly in Victoria and in regional areas. What do the exporters of Western Australia and Queensland think about this tariff debate and how it affects them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address the level playing field myth. What do we really mean by this? The New South Wales Farmers Association made some interesting comments about the level playing field. I would like to quote a couple of comments from what its members thought about it in the home game&mdash;that is, the tariff as it affects Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariffs favour some industries over others. These industries can charge higher prices to consumers compared to competing imports. These higher prices allow these industries to expand and bid for resources.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance provided to one industry hinders the development of others: one industry's assistance is frequently another industry's impediment. Industries need to develop on the basis of their capacity to use resources efficiently, rather than their access to assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>That would ensure that Australian manufacturers, exporters, miners, farmers and small businessmen had the following attributes: a flexible industrial relations system, a tax system which gave them incentive, low inflation, low interest rates, low oncosts and low government charges, and efficient power, waterfront and transport systems. These are, of course, all the attributes of the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level playing field of the MCG is the turf that could be used for our simile. The West Coast Eagles, when they played my home team of Geelong, had no unfair support from the sidelines. They were just quicker. They were more agile, they were more talented, and they were better performers on the day. The MCG was dead level and dry on that occasion, so they were able to win that particular game on their merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The away game is on the world pitch. It is very uneven, the goalposts often shift, there is a lot of sideline interference, the trainers bring in extra players, there is often extra time, quite often it is a wet wicket, and often there are very windy conditions. We have the conditions of the common agricultural policy in Europe, the export enhancement program in USA and the voluntary restraint by the US Government on the import of Japanese motor cars. We have tariff barriers, we have non-tariff barriers and we have dumping. Within that away game situation on the international market, Australia has to sell its products in terms of price, quality, delivery and service, and win the export game. Again, the New South Wales Farmers had this to say about the away game problems:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariff structure penalises our internationally competitive industries to the benefit in those inefficient industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the argument as to whether tariffs protect jobs. All the evidence that I have suggests that they do not. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table indicating the relationship between employment and effective rate of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That document clearly indicates the numbers of people employed in the TCF industries and the numbers of people employed in the car industries. It relates to the effective rates of assistance, which are defined to include:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the subsidy effect on output plus tax or subsidy effects of assistance on an industry's inputs. This measures the net effect of assistance on Australian production.</PARA>
<PARA>In very simple terms, in 1971 the TCF industries employed 174,000 persons, and in 1991 they employed 100,000 persons, although during that time the rates of protection increased. Likewise for cars: in 1971, 92,000 people were employed; in 1991, 65,000 people were employed. During this period the rates of effective protection actually increased, except on motor cars in the last 10 years, so it put a lie to the myth that rates of protection actually protects jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just indicate what other leaders in the textile and manufacturing industry have to say about these matters. Mr Dick Warburton has done a magnificent job with Du Pont. He has revolutionised the way in which the Fibremakers plant works in Melbourne with an enlightened industrial relations program. His view about tariffs, coming out of the textile industry, was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">under extended protection of tariffs and subsidies Australian manufacturing industry in general has become `fat, dumb and happy' and needed to significantly change its practices to become world competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, I quote Mr Ric Charlton, the managing director of Shell, who recently spent $600m on a world class refinery in Geelong to make that company world competitive. He had this to say about tariffs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of Shell Australia, one of the biggest companies in the nation with its headquarters firmly cemented in traditionally protectionist Melbourne, is emphatically not a pro-tariff man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He backs his views with his oil industry and Shell experience. "Suggesting that tariffs mean jobs, well, nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"If we do the things we need to do, we not only do not need tariffs, but they are a positive hindrance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is his view. Next, I quote from the very well publicised letter from Sir Arvi Parbo, a very great Australian, who brought the tariff debate to the attention of the Australian public. He said, in a very succinct, clear letter headed `Phase out tariffs without wavering':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a broad consensus within business, the political parties, and the community generally in support of a marked reduction or phasing out of tariffs on imports by the end of this century. This is essential to ensure that the Australian economy becomes world competitive, on which our future living standards depend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs are effectively a tax on all Australians. Worse than that, they are a tax on our export industries and severely constrain their ability to grow. Without such growth our already excessive overseas debt will continue to increase and the living standards will deteriorate further.</PARA>
<PARA>His final remark in that letter was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of Australia's future, we must stop playing short term political games, on car tariffs or on anything else, and re-focus on what really matters. The alternative is that we will continue going downhill as a country.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I indicate the attitude of the Business Council about tariffs. I quote Mr Paul Barratt, the executive director. His view, which I think reflects that of the Business Council, is this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong focus on the tariff is a distraction from the real issue, which is micro-economic reform&mdash;making inputs like electricity, industrial water, gas etc more competitively priced, reform of the taxation system to eliminate taxes on business inputs and the employee relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the tariff debate. There is no doubt that we need to change tariffs in that having tariff protected industries which only employ small numbers of people encourages an inward looking attitude in Australia, and what we need to encourage now is an outward looking, export oriented culture so that Australia can return to its former wealthy status. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This motion has apparently generated some considerable interest and I must say that I have been deeply surprised at the reaction of some people, in particular the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who phoned me two nights ago on behalf of the human rights committee and Senator Schacht and tried to pressure me into taking this motion off the agenda. </PARA>

My motion merely asks that we acknowledge progress in human rights issues in the Tibet Autonomous Region since the human rights delegation visited there last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to be very interested to listen to other speakers in this debate because, after all, I am the only person in this Parliament with personal experience of Tibet since that 1991 delegation. In terms of any progress that may have been made, all others will be speaking on second- or even tenth-hand hearsay. I say to the Parliament that propaganda is always a two-way street and Tibet is not exempt. My motion was prompted by a debate some weeks ago on the motion of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly since the visit of the Dalai Lama to Australia, Tibet has excited a great deal of interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My basic itinerary was established prior to my departure from Australia and followed requests made by me. While in China the itinerary was varied several times at my request. I was taken everywhere I asked to go, subject to time limitations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever I went, in every discussion, whether it was a formal or informal matter, I pursued four basic questions of human rights&mdash;religious freedom, the allegations that Tibetans were being swamped in their own country by Han Chinese, the presence of the People's Liberation Army, and the basic human rights relating to prisoners and executions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of religious freedom there were two sub-issues: the limitation of the numbers of monks and the restrictions on the training and induction of young boys. I say quite clearly that there is obviously freedom of worship. I visited the Norbulinka, the summer palace of the Dalai Lama; the Potala, his winter palace; the Jokhang Temple; the main village centres in Lhasa; Drepeng Monastery; Tashilhunpo; Pakhor Choide; and Ganden.

He is a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, deputy secretary of Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region of the Communist Party of China, and Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference of the Tibet Autonomous Region. He acknowledged this. He said that there must be certain conditions to sustain limitless numbers of lamas. He said they could not financially support an open-ended number of lamas. That confirms what we have all believed. He also stated that children aged 5, 6, 7 or 8 can go to be trained as lamas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are undoubtedly restrictions on numbers.

They are much more visible there than anywhere else in China. I must say that a great many of the PLA I saw in Lhasa were shopping or riding bicycles or wandering around with their shirt tails hanging out.

There were many members of the People's Liberation Army working on road repairs on the new road from Lhasa to Xigaze. At Gyantse, which I am told had about 20,000 people at the horse festival&mdash;and I can believe it, it was incredibly packed&mdash;I did see a group of PLA members, a company of riflemen and a bazooka platoon, who were bored stiff waiting for the parade to get cracking. On the fourth question of basic human rights, Mr Rak Dhi said, and I am quoting from the translation of the interpreter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our policy is no maltreatment of prisoners and no confessions to be obtained by force.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, they would say that, but he did go on to make what I believe is a very significant acknowledgment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some warders did maltreat detainees and force them to confess. This is not government policy and these warders were punished either by administrative means or by trial. So far over 20 of those warders have been sent to prison or punished. Forced confessions are against our law.</PARA>
<PARA>To my knowledge that is the first acknowledgment that they have been involved in forced confessions. He also said that in Tibet in the first half of this year six prisoners had been executed. Five were Han people and only one was a Tibetan. The 1991 delegation report mentioned a large presence of uniformed and civilian Chinese, and I believe that China would do far better to be more open on this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by referring to a visit to the Tibetan high school at Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. I went there at my request and I was supposed to have a brief visit, but it ended up being 3 1/2 hours. I saw the usual things&mdash;the language laboratories, the computers and so on&mdash;but most of my time was spent with three 18-year-old Tibetan girls who I encouraged to use their English. Finally one said, `What was your main impression of Tibet?', and I said, `I think the poverty'. She looked at me and said, `What poverty?'. I said, `The children begging'. She said, `Yes, but what else? They have food, they have shelter, they have clothing, they have medical services, they have some education'. We should not judge other people by our own standards, by our own conditions; we are wrong to do that. It lifted the scales right off my eyes. In conclusion, I say we can best help the Tibetans by acknowledging that progress has been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in seconding this motion. This Parliament owes the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) a great debt for the dedication and work he has put in to extract this report from Tibet. I have not been to Tibet but I have spent a lot of time in China&mdash;I am a regular visitor. I have been to all the provinces surrounding Tibet as well as to Gansu, which is not an adjoining province but which is one of my favourite parts of China, and I have been very impressed by the progress on human rights I have seen in China since I first went there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to understand when dealing with China is the great continuity of the country. It is a country where the people have a unity which is not found in most other parts of the world. One of the obsessions of China has been that it was not going to see the advances made in that country go the way of those in Eastern Europe. I am rather amused that people rejoice in the downfall of the Soviet Union and think that this is going to lead to some outburst of democracy. Democracy has no basis in those countries and the sad reality is that we are likely to see them slip into some sort of totalitarian fascism. We have already seen this in the destruction of Yugoslavia, a country that had a great potential but, alas, has now been destroyed and has sunk into sectarianism from which I believe there can be no future for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Tibet today really has to be compared with the situation that existed before China exerted its historical right. People who say that Tibet was an autonomous country are simply denying the history of that area. As long ago as during the Qing dynasty there is ample evidence of the suzerainty that China exerted over Tibet. In fact, going back even further, the only bridges in Tibet at the time of the Chinese occupation were bridges which were constructed during the Ming dynasty&mdash;that long ago. It was a country of appalling, grinding poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A census conducted during the Qing dynasty, which was done in the early seventeenth century, showed that roughly 30 per cent of the land in Tibet was owned by senior officials, a little less than 30 per cent was owned by a handful of prominent families&mdash;I think about seven very large traditional families&mdash;and about 30 per cent was owned by the lamas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety per cent of the people were serfs. They had no power. They were hereditary serfs and they lived in absolute grinding poverty with their owners exercising control literally over body and soul. Five per cent of the population were hereditary household servants. While it is easy to say that that was the style of life they had, I do not believe that human dignity would endure that of its own free will. There have clearly been great benefits from the action of China in re-establishing its suzerainty in that area. I believe that it does have the overwhelming support of the people of Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, there are really only two forms of freedom&mdash;political freedom and economic freedom. The reality of that is that while economic freedom can always buy political freedom, and does, political freedom can buy nothing. We have an example of that in our country, where the Aborigines have had absolute political freedom bestowed upon them, but still live in grinding poverty because there is no economic base. Because there is no economic base, they are not able to oppose the $2 billion industry that has grown up and operates in their name. Many Aboriginal people in this country realise that it is the welfare syndrome, dished out by this industry, that is destroying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What China has enabled the peasants of Tibet to do is to start to assemble that economic freedom. Under Chinese law, which is universally applied across China, these people have far more freedom than they had before. That is not hard. They had none before. So what freedom they have now had bestowed by China is a big advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that I have heard about this mass movement of the Han Chinese have described it as being like a locust plague across Tibet. The reality is that Tibet is a very harsh country with a cold climate. It is not a condition in which locusts would survive, never mind human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of population in China is such that two-thirds of the population in China is in the one-third of the country which is arable. The Chinese have always had a predisposition for this type of land. In the provinces of Zhejiang, Qinghai, and even Gansu and Sichuan, one thing that strikes the observer is that there is not a large population there. There is a lot of open space and a very harsh climate. So I do not believe those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ask ourselves why this occurs. I think that we all have to be aware of propaganda. It is unfortunate that so often in these days we have a slothful press which is prepared to carry the stories which are circulated without making any effort to verify them. It was very convenient for the West, particularly the United States, which was hell-bent on isolating or causing divisions in China, to conjure up this vision of the sort of thing that was happening in Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the situation in Yugoslavia. Everyone in the West has been berated about the actions of the wicked Serbs. The truth is that the Serbs were no more to blame than any other group in Yugoslavia. There is no conflict between Macedonia and Serbia, although they have a common border. But we in the West have tried to make the Serbs the evil people. They were always pictured in the media of the United States, Britain, France and this country as the cause of the problem. Of course, it was not so, and assuming that that is the case means that a solution can never be reached. The same sort of propaganda exercise was carried out in relation to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what the Chinese people have done is of enormous benefit to China. There is ongoing stability and there has been incremental advancement. When I first went to China in 1982 I was appalled at some of the things I saw. I was appalled at the ignorance and at the conditions in which a lot of the people lived. I have been back at about four-yearly intervals since and every time I have gone back I have seen advancements. We get the Tiananmen Square incident recited to us. The reality of Tiananmen Square was that the Chinese were determined to show the world that they would not tolerate the sort of insurrection, disruption and anarchy that occurred in Russia and eastern Europe. They were not going to tolerate that; they were going to have steady progress. As the Chinese observed to me, the answer can be seen in the train loads of Russians who are coming into China and buying consumer goods to take back to their own places. Russians can be seen at the stations carrying washing machines which they have come to China to purchase because they are not available in their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what is happening is greatly beneficial. One has only to look at the agricultural production of Tibet. This is always a measure of the standard of living in a society. Since the early 1950s, grain production has risen almost tenfold and production from animal husbandry has increased substantially. It has not happened, as we are told, by chopping down vast forests and bringing in vast new areas of land; it has happened by people having the incentive to work their own land, by the use of better agricultural practices, agricultural extension services and fertiliser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the Chinese occupation in 1953, the wooden plough was the most advanced technology in Tibet. This is not mythology; this can be proved historically. Today we have tractors there; we have people using this advanced technology, and it is demonstrated by the increases in productivity. In the future there may be an outburst of Tibetan nationalism. With rising middle classes this often happens. All I can say is that the people of Tibet, thanks to the actions of China, will be far better placed to handle that than they were in the conditions of serfdom that applied previously. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is an active member of our parliamentary group of Amnesty and in that sense I know that he undertakes this approach in a genuine sense of achieving a dialogue on what is obviously a very difficult issue. I think the motion needs to be seen as an occasion not necessarily for going over the whole unhappy history of human rights in Tibet but for focusing, as the honourable member for Cowper wants to, on the progress, such as it is, that has been made. But the violation of human rights and the cultural suppression since the establishment of strong central rule by the Communist Government of China since the 1950s are well known and form the background to the ongoing problems in Tibet. We in the Opposition hope that these problems may be put behind us and that an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation may be established. That is what we are seeking. It is inevitable, however, that there will be continuing strife and conflict and I suspect that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) was alluding to the possibility that those sorts of things can occur. If genuine improvements are not made in the human rights record in Tibet, obviously difficulties will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with this motion is one of agreeing upon the human rights baseline provided by the nomination of the visit of the delegation in 1991. The purpose of that visit was to commence a constructive dialogue, rather than to gather exhaustive information for an authoritative baseline assessment of human rights. While the delegation visited Tibet, this was merely one of several aspects of the wider human rights dialogue. One of the most important observations made by the delegation was the difficulty in obtaining information in a situation where freedom of speech and other civil liberties, as we might know them, are not established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the delegation was inevitably composed more of impressions than of accurate and verifiable information regarding individual cases. My colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) will allude to that when he speaks later. The general conclusion of the delegation was `that a serious human rights problem exists in Tibet'. Since July last year, there have been continuing reports of human rights violations. Amnesty International and other human rights organisations continue to report particular cases of torture and other abuses of human rights. I do not think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has suggested that that might not still be occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, for example, Amnesty reported the arrest of more than 200 people suspected of pro-independence activities. As at January 1992, Amnesty International reported that at least 100 prisoners of conscience were known to be held in Tibet. Since April 1992, three prisoners of conscience taken up by Amnesty have been released, but dozens remain in detention, despite appeals by human rights organisations. Amnesty also reports the continuing receipt of reports of the systematic use of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners. It may be the case that action is taken about those matters when they come to notice, but those reports are still being received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August, the United States delegate, Ms Linda Chavez, reported to the United Nations Subcommission on Human Rights in Geneva that serious abuses were still taking place in China, although they were now taking place more discreetly, and out of the way of Western observers and television cameras. In response, China reacted this week with a veiled attack, as the honourable member may have seen, on the United Nations. The Secretary-General, Jiang Zemin, in his opening address to the first Communist Party Congress in five years, condemned what he regarded as interference by stronger, richer countries in the affairs of those that were smaller and economically weaker. He said that China would never submit to such pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in such attacks, however, the effectiveness of international pressure can be detected. There is implicit acknowledgment that China can no longer afford to cut itself off from the rest of the world. The White Paper released by China in September seeks to defend China's record in relation to Tibet. It devotes much of its space to issues of history and the fact that Tibetan independence has never been recognised. Some attention is also given to current issues, such as Tibetan culture and religious freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mistakes made during the period of the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976 are freely admitted. Instances of support by the Chinese central government of Tibetan Buddhism, at least in the form of funding for restoration of important buildings and monuments, are cited. I imagine that, in much the same way as we saw in much of Eastern Europe, a form of religious freedom is also sustained. It is argued that Tibetan culture and language are given full encouragement and support. Both Chinese and Tibetan are used officially, but Tibetan is said to be given `first place' in the Tibetan autonomous region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also claimed that there has been no policy of Tibetans being outnumbered by Han Chinese, either through migration from elsewhere in China or population control programs. However, with many of these statistics, there is significant disagreement between the Chinese Government and Tibetan nationalists. I am certain that, if I were there, I would not be able to make ready judgments in relation to those matters, in the short time that we can make those sorts of inquiries in any form of visit that we undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Chinese claim to have provided considerable assistance to Tibet, the price that has been paid has been the reported loss of approximately 1.2 million Tibetan lives, and the destruction of over 6,000 monasteries and temples and the loss of countless artefacts, as well as the exploitation of Tibet's rich mineral resources. The report suggests that, even while the White Paper on Tibet is being released, China's policy on populating Tibet with ethnic Chinese is continuing. The reports that I have read have indicated that that is occurring in a way which has greater impact on some areas than others. No doubt the first-hand evidence from my colleague&mdash;that in the areas which he visited that was not the case&mdash;may very well respond to the sorts of reports that I receive from time to time about the nature of that impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amnesty International's response to China's White Paper was not enthusiastic. On September 30, Amnesty made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "white paper" makes a number of statements about the range of rights guaranteed in theory by the Chinese constitution, but Amnesty International is concerned that the exercise of these rights is severely limited in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "white Paper" states that "respect for and protection of religious belief is a basic policy of the Chinese government", adding that "those who carry out law-breaking and conduct criminal activities under the guise of religion will be prosecuted according to law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also states that "any activity sabotaging stability and unity in Tibet and any unlawful deed creating disturbance and inciting riots runs against the basic interests of the Tibetan people and will be cracked down on relentlessly".</PARA>
<PARA>Amnesty went on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Harsh repression has led to serious and long-standing human rights violations in Tibet. Tibetans who speak out against the Chinese Government are at risk of imprisonment, possibly for years, and torture. Those who take part in peaceful demonstrations for Tibetan independence from China have been in the past killed, targeted by security forces.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the victims of the widespread human rights violations are monks and nuns, who have been imprisoned and tortured. . . Some were arrested and held without charge for weeks, months or even years. Others were eventually tried and received stiff sentences. One senior monk, Yulo Daw Tsering, is a prisoner of conscience serving a 10-year prison sentence for "spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda".</PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of continuing reports that Amnesty receives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrests are arbitrary and detainees are often held in administrative detention without ever being charged. When charges are brought, they are frequently "for counter-revolutionary" acts such as handing out leaflets or giving information to foreigners. In one case, a medical doctor, Jampa Ngodrup, was given a 13-year prison sentence in 1990, because he helped compile and distribute lists of victims of human rights violations in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA>Detention, torture and ill-treatment are matters that have been noted. Detainees have been beaten and have described the form which those beatings have taken. Amnesty described the White Paper as presenting `a distorted view' of the situation in Chinese prisons, and noted that it failed to address numerous accounts of torture and ill-treatment from former prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper condemned the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Nationalists as `the Dalai Clique and Separatist elements'. This is clearly symptomatic of continuing problems that will not be solved until the Chinese Government recognises that respect for human rights is essential for the promotion of reconciliation and peaceful development within Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the motion today seeks to maintain constructive engagement with the issue of China on human rights, it is supporting a process which we hope will lead to improvements. The process of dialogue, however, will not be assisted by ignoring continuing reports of human rights abuse and hoping that the good intentions announced by the Chinese leaders have, in fact, ended abuses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), I wish to make no apology for those who were part of the management or governance of Tibet prior to its invasion by China. There is much regarding the theocracy that was the then Government of Tibet that, quite properly, would be condemned by a world that has put human rights much higher on the international agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, where the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and I part company is in our categorisation of the Chinese relationship to Tibet. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has indicated that China exerted its historic right in its invasion, but the historic record is certainly more ambiguous than he suggests and, properly examined, runs contrary to the proposition that he put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tibet first enters into Chinese history as a powerful and aggressive kingdom whose hostility the T'ang dynasty in China sought, generally unsuccessfully, to contain. The relationship developed over centuries and China and Tibet became more closely associated and in 1644 the fifth Dalai Lama arrived in Peking to visit the new, rising Manchu dynasty. There was no suggestion of subordination in the relationship at that time. In fact, the visit was welcomed by the Chinese authorities, who treated the Dalai Lama with all the ceremony that would have been accorded to an independent sovereign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period when China first exercised any substantial hegemony was in 1720 when a Manchu army entered Lhasa for the first time and imposed its own nominee as Dalai Lama, with the eventual installation of a Manchu resident to keep Tibetan affairs under surveillance and a Manchu garrison in the city. If we look at that background we see that the first takeover of Tibet by a regime based in China, although it does antedate the Communist intervention, still belongs to the comparatively recent period of modern history, much the same period as that when various European nations imposed colonial rule on so many parts of the world. Chinese rule in Tibet has no more historical or cultural justification than European colonial rule in India, South East Asia or elsewhere. Yet whereas the former European colonies have been released from colonial dependence throughout the globe, Chinese rule in Tibet still survives, a complete anachronism in the world of the late twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The invasion of Tibet was not a peaceful invasion. Since the takeover of Tibet, about 1.2 million Tibetans, about one-sixth of the total population, have died as a result of the occupation. There have been 7.5 million Chinese colonists moving into Tibet and 6,000 monasteries destroyed. Whilst I agree entirely with the sentiment in the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and I think he has moved it in a spirit that no-one could disagree with, I also agree with the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) that the motion takes a very unsatisfactory base line. It seems to me that there is clear evidence that human rights abuses still persist in Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How this House ought to respond to a situation against that background is a difficult question. I also agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that we should not seek to look at other parts of the world through our own ethnocentric views. But there are now accepted standards of international behaviour which have been developed and articulated through organisations such as Amnesty, of which the honourable member for Cowper, the honourable member for Dundas and I are members. Where I part company from the honourable member for Cowper is at the same point where the honourable member for Dundas departs from the propositions put forward by the honourable member for Cowper. I believe that the situation is not appropriate for us to adopt the language of the motion which is that we acknowledge the progress being made in human rights since the visit of the Australian delegation in July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be specific points on which I could join with the honourable member for Cowper, in terms of approving certain steps that have been taken. For example, his account of the uncontested illustrations of freedom of worship occurring now is a very important testimony to liberalisation, at least in so far as participation in religious worship is concerned. But there are also many well-documented accounts of persistent abuses of human rights, which perhaps would be obscured if we adopted language which seemed to condone those abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that is not the intention, but one can simply go through the accounts of both Asia Watch and Amnesty International, as the honourable member for Dundas did. For example, I point to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 17 February 1992 which recounted the Asia Watch report. This documented 360 Tibetans detained for political offences since 1987, 240 of whom were still in custody as of September 1991. The Amnesty International organisation, in its press release of 20 May 1992, reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government opponents in Tibet are arbitrarily arrested and frequently tortured as the authorities in the People's Republic of China continue to crack down all opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>That press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Harsh repression has led to serious and long-standing human rights violations in Tibet, said the organisation. Tibetans who speak out against the Chinese Government are at risk of imprisonment, possibly for years, and torture. Those who take part in peaceful demonstrations for Tibetan independence from China have been killed, targeted by security forces.</PARA>
<PARA>Amnesty International, on 30 September, reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, over 80 suspected pro-independence activists have reportedly been arrested by police in and around Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Three prisoners of conscience whose cases have been taken up . . . have been released . . . Dozens remain in detention despite repeated appeals by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of such other reports which show that this problem is a continuing one. I certainly do not wish to reflect on the motivation of the honourable member for Cowper; he was obviously powerfully impressed by what he saw. But as the honourable member for Dundas says, there is a difference between what one sees immediately as one travels and a broad picture. Many people of great goodwill, for example, went to the former Soviet Union and returned saying they had seen the future. These people would be deeply embarrassed now by their incapacity to understand that, in fact, they had been misled by what had been paraded in front of them and by what they had seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of any one observer to see all the information in front of him and to have a comprehensive oversight is limited. That is why it is so important for organisations such as Amnesty to be able to provide a more substantial and detailed overview built up on research and coordinated by their international secretariat in London. I believe this secretariat has very considerable weight in the international community. I certainly commend the honourable member for the spirit in which this motion was put forward but I adopt the reservations to it, expressed by the honourable member for Dundas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, since our visit to Tibet last July, there have been continuing reports&mdash;whether from Amnesty International, Asia Watch or other reputable human rights organisations&mdash;suggesting that there has not been any noticeable change in the human rights situation to be found in Tibet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that the administration of Tibet is easy. It is not easy for anybody. Nor am I in any sense supporting the continuation of the medieval culture which is what in many respects was the pre-1960 situation. But, having said that, the evidence we gathered last year brought home to us quite clearly the fact that there is still considerable support among the Tibetan people for the Dalai Lama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that the Opposition has continued to support the view, which is certainly that of the Australian Government, that it would be in the interests of the People's Republic of China and its government to enter into some dialogue on an official basis with the Dalai Lama, and hopefully with a minimum number of pre-conditions, so that there can be open discussions of the situation in Tibet with a view to resolving the evident tensions which exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the report released earlier this year by the Chinese authorities on human rights, and in particular in relation to Tibet, sadly contained a polemic against the Dalai Lama. But the fact is that this attitude is still permeating the entire bilateral relationship within China between Beijing and Ilsa on the one hand, Dhamasala on the other, and the Tibetan people. It demonstrates the depth of the cultural gap which still clearly exists within the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan people, whether they be in Tibet or outside and for whatever reason they may have been required to leave China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of the Tibetan relationship with China is a complex one. It is my impression that in many respects the Tibetan language has been stultified over the last 30 years. All the films they see are in Mandarin. The Chinese language is slowly but surely permeating the cultural life of the Tibetan people. This is probably a natural outcome. It is very difficult to educate through a full system which encourages the Tibetan language side by side with the Chinese language. The reality is that those Tibetans who proceed to higher levels of education invariably do so outside Tibet, and they are being taught in Chinese. That in itself is going to achieve over time what is obviously the policy of the Chinese Government: the gradual Sinofication of Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, as I said there are still considerable reasons for concern. Our delegation gave the authorities in Lhasa the names of 100 people we knew to be in custody. We sought advice on their welfare and their well-being. To the best of my knowledge, that advice has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Human Rights Subcommission has continued to be critical of aspects of human rights and the administration of Tibet. It is supported by the views and evidence of Asia Watch and Amnesty International. Regrettably, Tibet still remains a major issue internationally. The Chinese authorities naturally regard Tibet as part of the sovereign responsibility of China, and most States support that view. However, that does not in any sense change the fact that human rights are now a matter of great concern in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is significant that the Chinese authorities earlier this year actually published a White Paper on human rights in China. Whether we agree with its contents or not is beside the point. The important thing is they now acknowledge, as we do, that human rights is on the international agenda, and quite clearly it will remain so. I hope that our delegation's second visit will improve the situation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I regard the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) as a personal friend and one of the finest members of this House, I say that I disagree entirely with this motion. Last year I spoke in this House on the issue of human rights in Tibet. I supported a US congressional resolution calling on communist China to end its illegal conquest of Tibet and cease its tyranny against the Tibetan people. Communist China has by force of arms illegally occupied Tibet for over 40 years. Its brutal occupation has been characterised by unrestrained cruelty and a merciless campaign of destruction of Tibetan culture, religion and national identity. Reliable western intelligence sources have long accepted the fact that as many as one million Tibetans may have died as a result of China's illegal occupation of Tibet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that as a principle of international law the establishment of diplomatic relations with Communist China does imply recognition of China's sovereignty over Tibet. Nevertheless, I renew my call that Australia should recognise Tibet as an occupied country under established principles of international law. The true representatives of Tibet are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile as recognised by the Tibetan people. I repeat the call I made in this House last year that the Australian Government should encourage the United Nations to apply trade sanctions against Communist China until such time as Tibet is liberated and its legitimate government restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's violations of human rights in Tibet have not abated. If anything, these abuses have become more pervasive, more cunning and more entrenched than ever before. The Australian Government remains most concerned about the repression of religious freedom, cultural identity and freedom of expression in Tibet. As recently as June this year the Australian Foreign Minister raised these concerns with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. I understand that a human rights delegation from Australia will visit China in November this year, and this reflects the Government's continuing concerns over the human rights situation in Tibet. I hope that the Australian human rights delegation will not accept any nonsense from the communist Chinese authorities and will thoroughly investigate, where possible, allegations of human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because China has maintained strict controls on information regarding human rights in Tibet, it has been difficult for Western intelligence to obtain precise data on the number of prisoners detained for political reasons. Indeed, requests by the Australian human rights delegation in July 1991 to meet with such prisoners were denied by Chinese authorities on the ground that Chinese law permits visits to prisoners by relatives only. Tibetans have been imprisoned for peacefully advocating Tibet's independence from China. Even the possession of a Tibetan nationalist flag is treated by the communist Chinese as a counter-revolutionary violation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous reports of torture of inmates in prisons, and of prisoners who have died within weeks of their release as a result of ill-treatment or lack of medical care in detention. The methods of torture used by the communist Chinese on Tibetan prisoners include every devilish variation of brutality. International protests by the United States Congress, Amnesty International and many others have been ignored by communist China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations report on human rights in Tibet was presented to the Human Rights Commission in February this year, it was the first time China had been hauled before the United Nations watchdog. The report contained allegations of widespread abuse by the communist Chinese, including systematic torture, unfair imprisonment and forced abortions. The communist Chinese response was a blunt denial, even though the 71-page document contained evidence from 12 private human rights organisations of detailed reports of systematic torture and ill-treatment of prisoners, many of whom were held without trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the motion purports to acknowledge the progress being made in human rights questions in the Tibet Autonomous Region since the visit of the Australian human rights delegation to China in July 1991.

Today, while I agree with my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) on 99.9 per cent of the things he stands for in this place, I have to say that I oppose him on this motion. While I recognise that technically there may have been some small improvement in the human rights situation in Tibet over the last year&mdash;mainly due to world pressure, I might add&mdash;the situation in that country is still very oppressive by any civilised standard. If this motion gained substantive support, I fear it would send an incorrect signal to the Chinese that they could keep doing what they have been doing in Tibet and we would approve of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China is a country I am very fond of, and it is inhabited by a people that I admire very much, but it is ruled over by a communist government which is very oppressive. There is no freedom of movement, speech or ownership, by our standards. The Chinese shoot those who oppose the unelected dictatorship. The recent most spectacular example of that was Tiananmen Square. They do not have elections, and the communist dictatorship is or has been responsible for the slaughter of tens of millions of its own people. I hardly think that qualifies it to be ruling over another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tibet today we have no democracy, we have no elections, we have no self-determination, which the United Nations and the International Commission of Jurists have determined that Tibet has a right to. There is no proper freedom of speech. There are very restricted conditions under which people may practise and observe religious beliefs. Communist China has been responsible for the slaughter of 1.2 million people in a country of 7 million. They have reduced to rubble 6,000 monasteries, though they are restoring some of them now. They have shipped valuable artefacts out of the country and sold them. They have excessively mined and logged the land and polluted and raped the countryside and the people. There are reports still coming out of that country that people are forced to live in filth and poverty. Nothing works properly. The native Tibetans themselves are discriminated against in access to education, services and jobs compared with the Chinese and they have become second class citizens in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is misleading to say that conditions are okay in Tibet today. If it is so wonderful over there, why are the Tibetan people calling for a free Tibet? Why have the Chinese authorities arrested monks and nuns and children, and continue to do so, for such simple things as talking to tourists, for asking for a free Tibet, for compiling lists of political prisoners and even possessing the Tibetan flag? Only in July of this year a report came out that 12 Tibetan nuns had been arrested during a pro-independence demonstration in Lhasa for the crime of carrying two Tibetan flags around the Potala palace. It says in this report that the Tibetan flag, which shows a snowline and a snow covered mountain, is outlawed in Tibet. The two flags were approximately one metre by two metres in size and each one was carried by two of the nuns, all of whom came from Garu nunnery, seven kilometres north-west of Lhasa. I am holding a Tibetan flag in my hand myself. If I were doing that in Tibet today I would be arrested by the Chinese authorities there. It is hardly a free country by any standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous reports from Asia Watch, Tibetan Information Network and Amnesty International, as has been highlighted by previous speakers, documenting gross violations in the last 12 months of political arrests, brutal torture, beatings, electric shocks, persecution and discrimination against Tibetan people. I have just one report here of a Tibetan monk in his mid-thirties who had a Tibetan flag and took part in a brief protest in support of Tibetan independence. As a result his thumbs were chained together, he was hung up by his hands from the roof and suspended there, without touching the floor, on and off for one month and 10 days. After that he was released from prison and expelled from the monastery and his ration card has been withdrawn. It appears that he will not do that again if the Chinese authorities have their way. There is another report from Amnesty International which says that Chad, Iraq and China are the worse violators of human rights in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Chinese are so confident of what they are doing in Tibet, confident that it is good and that it is welcomed by the locals, I challenge them to put it to the vote.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to focus on some comments in the media in the last few days about two classes of Australians developing in this country. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has been running some articles in the last few days which are a warning to us in this Parliament that Australia could turn into a country of haves and have-nots. The study which has been brought to our attention by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> indicates that incomes, for example,  between 1980 and 1990 have changed quite dramatically, depending on where one lives in Australia. Under the present Government, we see that there has been a great disparity between the rate at which incomes have grown in the western suburbs of Sydney and the rate in some of the North Shore and eastern suburbs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make this a political debate about the role of different governments, but I do want to highlight the fact that we do not want a country in which we have two basic groups of people. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> it was shown that in the eastern and the northern suburbs incomes have increased by about 175 per cent&mdash;and some up to 200 per cent&mdash;in the last 10 years, as compared with some of the western suburbs where incomes have increased by only 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not all. A UN development report indicates that, as far as equality goes, Australia is at the bottom of the 21 countries surveyed. For example, the bottom 40 per cent of households in Australia account for 15.5 per cent of income. In the United States it is 15.7 per cent, in Britain 17.3 per cent, and in Japan 21.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a similar story with the top 20 per cent of households. Overall, no matter which study is looked at, the income gap is widening in Australia. Another indication that this is a problem in Australia is the observation made by Victoria's Police Commissioner, Mr Kelvin Glare. In regard to crimes and other indicators, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We run the risk of the development of an under-class, a group of young disadvantaged people without jobs, without hope, a class of unemployed at risk of becoming unemployable.</PARA>
<PARA>At the Liberal Party of Australia's jobs forum in July, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even many of those with access to higher education will not be able to obtain meaningful jobs at the completion of their studies. I would suggest that the high levels of unemployment which will continue will almost certainly lead to the development of a disadvantaged under-class who will not embrace the norms and values of the society which has failed them.</PARA>
<PARA>When we look at this and ask what sorts of responses governments are going to have to make, I believe that we need to look further than at what the Federal Government can do, what the State governments can do, or what local government can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the fourth tier of government, that is, the family. The family is the fourth tier of government which all other tiers of government use as a building block. If the fourth tier of government is not functioning properly I suggest that it is very difficult for the other three tiers of government to operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When governments fail, the family becomes the bulwark for those people who are at the blunt end of what is happening in the country or the economy. So the family serves an important role in the functioning of this country. In this respect, governments can either support and strengthen the family unit or they can actually undermine it. I believe strongly that over recent years we have, as administrators of this country, quite specifically undermined the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to illustrate one area in regard to the way in which we have done it in financial terms. I know that families do not break up just because of financial pressures, but financial pressures are an important component in many families breaking up. I have made a comparison of an intact family with a separated family. In the example both families have two children under the age of 13 and one parent working on an annual income of $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the benefits which governments provide to the intact family we find the following: the family allowance will provide $1,076 per annum, or $41.40 per fortnight. The family allowance supplement to this family, after the income test has been applied and including rent assistance, is $3,235 per annum. The dependent spouse rebate is $1,379 per annum. That is a total of $5,690 in government assistance to this intact family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the situation of that family separating we find the following benefits flow to that family. The sole parent pension will provide $6,295 per annum. The additional pension for the children will be $3,162 per annum. The mother's or guardian's allowance will provide $746. The family allowance is $1,076, and rent assistance is $1,911 per annum. That is a total benefit of $13,190 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shows that if a family separates then they are financially better off to the tune of $7,500 per annum, or approximately $150 net per week. I believe this situation fundamentally undermines the social structure of our society. As administrators of this country, different governments have tried to provide for those people in need, but in so doing they have actually pulled out some of the foundations from underneath those people who have made a commitment to marriage and who are in a legal relationship. So what we find is a real financial incentive for people to separate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has a lot of social implications for this country. I know that there might be honourable members here who would disagree with this&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little bit disturbed to hear the words that have just been said by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). At first when he was talking about analysing what is happening to the country he started to quote from what is happening in the western suburbs of Sydney. He must have read some of the research I was just about to present in the grievance debate before the House today. I would have thought that the honourable member for Braddon, coming from Tasmania, would neither understand nor appreciate the complexities of an electorate in the western suburbs of Sydney such as I represent. But to say that people break up just for the money is remarkable. We are going back to the Dark Ages. I did not believe that anyone in this Parliament would have those ideas about people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very recently been talking to women in my electorate in the western suburbs of Sydney, women who are concerned about what is going to happen if the GST and the Opposition's policy were ever to become reality. I spoke to a number of those women and I also did some research pertaining to their concerns. I found that women workers would be among the worst affected victims of the Fightback consumption tax package. As well as the extra tax burden it would impose on working people, the package proposes to cut out government activities which have very broad community support and have been specially designed to help women overcome the everyday problems they face at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These programs include the Affirmative Action Agency and two special programs in the Department of Industrial Relations. The Affirmative Action Agency was set up by our Government to ensure that equal employment is a practical goal and not just another platitude. The Agency plays a very important role in advising business on how to implement `best practice', affirmative action policies, and it has received more than 2,500 inquiries from business in the past year alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hewson consumption tax package proposes that the Agency should be abolished, but without `any impact on the legislative guarantees of equal employment opportunity'. I tell honourable members that this is absolute rubbish. Legislation can guarantee nothing if it has no effective mechanism such as the Agency to police it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposals for cutting costs in the Department of Industrial Relations also will have the effect of abolishing the equal pay and work family units within that Department. The equal pay unit carries out or commissions research on pay equity issues, contributes on pay equity to government submissions in wage cases, and provides advice on pay equity issues to the Government generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One politically significant effect of the Hewson proposal would be that there would be no expert departmental advice or recommendations on the significant damage to women's earnings if the coalition's enterprise bargaining policy were ever put into practice. Also, women working in the Public Service may lose their jobs or be treated less fairly because of the cutbacks, and other women would be adversely effected by the introduction of full enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of full enterprise bargaining would mean that the income of many women would suffer. Women in my electorate, women on lower incomes, would be disadvantaged by the Opposition not proceeding with increases in the superannuation guarantee levy. Women now approaching 55, who may have thought of retiring early, would need to think again because of the new tax involved. They also would have to wait until 65 before being eligible for the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumption tax package shows a strong New Zealand influence in connection with women and other traditionally disadvantaged workers. Its basic point is to reduce wages by reducing the protection that workers have available to them through their unions and industrial tribunals. Women workers in New Zealand, especially in the service sector, are suffering significant pay cuts. Some are receiving up to 30 per cent less than previously in their pay packets. They are working longer hours, even longer weeks, usually with no overtime, no penalty rates or any other form of compensation. They cannot resist all that easily, because the award system has been abolished and the capacity of their unions to help has been cut down by law. They cannot quit, because anybody in New Zealand who voluntarily leaves a job cannot get any unemployment benefits for at least six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the system that the Leader of the Opposition wants to bring into Australia. This would be a tragedy for women in all walks of Australian working life and it would overturn all of the work achieved over the past eight years under our Labor Government, particularly through the Labor Government-ACTU accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the effect of the Fightback package relates to child-care fees for families. The fees for a family with one child in care would rise by up to $870 a year under the coalition's goods and services tax. The coalition's policy, as detailed in Fightback, does not allow GST exemptions for child-care. The 15 per cent GST on child-care would not be significantly offset by the elimination of the wholesale sales tax or the payroll tax. If everything is taken into account, the GST would increase child-care fees by some 14 per cent, resulting in an increase in full time fees to families of over $16.80 a week where the weekly charge is $120. This is equivalent to an increase of $873.60 over a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST would also impact adversely on the gains made under this Labor Government in the provision of affordable, quality child-care. Under Labor, the number of funded child-care places has more than trebled from 46,000 in 1983 to 177,500 at the end of 1990-91, and is now expected to reach 250,000 places by the end of 1996. Some 130,000 families now receive assistance with their child-care fees. Maximum fee relief is provided to slightly less than half of the families assisted by the Federal Government. Under a Hewson government, tax deductions would yield greatest savings to parents on highest incomes, and would provide little or no assistance to lower income families. They would not benefit women who are studying or looking for work, or those who are at home and not in the paid work force, because they are not earning an income from which to deduct their expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if low income families were to attract a tax rebate at the end of the year, these families would face difficulties in meeting the weekly cost of quality child-care. In contrast, the current fee relief system targets those most in need at the time the cost is incurred. Fee relief also assists women who are not in the paid work force, and the lack of affordable child-care can be a major work force disincentive for many women. The recent extension of fee relief to families using commercial child-care, a much more significant and well-targeted system of assistance for families than tax deductibility, will result in an estimated 28,000 new commercial and employer provided places over those next five years. Additionally, our Federal Government is negotiating with the States to provide an additional 50,000 community based places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition, fewer households would be eligible for family allowance and family allowance supplement due to the tightening up of the income and assets tests. This would result in some 91,000 families losing the allowance, and 37,000 families losing the supplement. Children's programming is also likely to be reduced, in terms of both quality and quantity, as a result of the cuts to the ABC under the coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury analysis of Fightback indicated that overall the consumer price index would rise by 4.6 per cent under the Opposition's package. For the women I spoke to in my electorate food prices would rise by 8.9 per cent, with dairy products rising by 9.6 per cent, meat and seafood by 9.9 per cent, fresh fruit and vegetables by 10.1 per cent and takeaway foods by 9.6 per cent. Clothing would go up 11.2 per cent, electricity would rise 10.7 per cent, gas would go up 7.8 per cent, postal and telephone services would rise by 8.1 per cent, health services would rise by 22.87 per cent and urban transport fares could be expected to go up by at least 6.59 per cent. State funds would be cut, so State charges would be expected to increase. Such increases have not been taken into account in the estimates of the likely overall rise in the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts are made in Fightback to compensate for the price rises which would be caused by the GST. However, Treasury figures indicate that this compensation is likely to be very inadequate for many of the households that have been analysed. The effect of Fightback on the sole parent pension is also of concern to women. The sole parent pension would cease under a coalition government when the youngest child turns 12, and would be replaced with a Job Search allowance. In this way 31,000 parents, mainly women, would lose their pension. It would be retained only where the children required care because of special difficulties. Sole parents would be forced to work or to look for work in order to get the Job Search allowance. Most would be able to do only part time work to enable them to continue to be there for their children when they came home from school. Fightback would obviously have a major negative impact on most Australian women's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of great concern to the women that I spoke to is the GST and what it would mean in terms of price rises. There are strong doubts about attempts at compensation and whether they would even be adequate. There is also suspicion, given the costing shortfall of $4 billion identified by the Department of Finance, that not all of the proposed compensation would in fact occur. These factors, together with spending cuts&mdash;particularly in areas of social security&mdash;affect all women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case involved the now 15-year-old son of my constituent's first marriage. Ultimately, after a long court battle, the child was given into the custody of my constituent by a decision of Mr Justice Bulley of the Family Court in 1986. I am satisfied, from what I have been told, that justice in relation to custody of the child was finally done through the timely intervention of the former Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent, in desperation at the lack of assistance he was receiving from other people in positions of authority, actually knocked on the door of Mr Bowen's home in the Kingsford-Smith electorate. He was received&mdash;and this will not surprise anyone who knows her&mdash;in a properly gracious way by Mrs Bowen, a lady who had very wide respect in this Parliament during the time that her husband was here. As a result of that, events were set in train which led to the proper handling of this matter in the courts and ultimately justice, so far as the custody of the child was concerned, being done in favour of both my constituent and his son. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to weary the House with details of the circumstances of the case. They are, as always in these cases, immensely distressing and immensely unpleasant. But the judgment was that the child was at risk in the custody of his mother, and that certainly he was subjected to constant abuse, with very strong suggestions that his own mother was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter that was of enormous concern to my constituent, and the reason why some five or six years after the matter was finally adjudicated by the courts he has constantly sought my help on it, is his belief that officers of the then Department of Youth and Community Services in New South Wales adopted a biased and prejudicial attitude and an apparent belief that it was impossible, in a contest between the mother and father of the child, to believe that the child's welfare would be better served in the custody of his father. I told my constituent that it would be better for him and better for his son if the matter were not further ventilated. His reply to me&mdash;which I found it impossible to resist, and that is why finally I raise the matter in parliament today&mdash;was that he believed he had not received justice at the hands of the State Government department and that much of the misery inflicted upon his son and on him, ultimately adjudged to be the case by the decision of the Family Court, was the result of that negligence and misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before raising this matter, I sought advice and evidence from some of the psychiatrists who had been involved in the case. I want to read to the House an extract from a report from one of the consultant psychologists, Mr Geoffrey A. Fox of Homebush. He wrote to me saying that in March 1985 he prepared the following statement. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a consultant psychologist with over 20 years professional experience in the assessment of children and adults. I have reviewed the material held by Mr X and interviewed Mr X on a number of occasions. The evidence he has presented has certainly concerned me and made me suspect that his case has been subject to considerable bias. The Department of Youth and Community Affairs has not exercised the level of responsibility which I believe the case merits, and there is enough evidence to make me suspect that his pleas have been subject to prejudice against his claim. The assessment on these grounds should be conducted by a reputable child-care organisation which is more objective than one that would be provided by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that he subsequently attended the court hearing as a specialist witness. He reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the case was clearly convoluted and complex, it seems to have been well established that a highly respected psychiatrist who specialised in paediatric psychiatry had recommended that access by Mr X to his son&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which, I interpolate, had for a long period been interrupted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should be denied, even though a previous decision of the court had granted this access. The evidence I have read implies that this specialist opinion had been strongly prejudiced against Mr X, by reports and oral statements emanating from the State Department. Not only was Mr X prejudiced in this matter, but there seemed good grounds for believing that the court actions were delayed by a variety of ploys to make it more difficult for Mr X to prosecute his case. This view is presented to me in a letter from L.W. Williams and Associates, solicitors, dated 20 March, 1985. From my reading of the documents, the psychiatrist subsequently admitted, under cross-examination, there was no evidence that Mr X was any threat to his son and that, during the period of restricted and then denied access, the boy had been physically and sexually abused while in the care of his mother. I therefore formally express my firm conviction that Mr X had suffered from unwarranted prejudice at the hands of persons representing the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the extract from his report. I might mention to the House that, before deciding to raise this matter, I submitted the entire file, together with the representations I had accumulated, to two successive Ministers in the New South Wales Government. I was not satisfied with the replies that I received from them. I have not brought this matter here lightly. I do not believe in using parliamentary privilege to attack the general reputation of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know these matters of custody are immensely difficult and complex, that they involve the most enormous examples of conflicting and difficult human emotions, and that on the question of child abuse there is a tendency for people, quite understandably, to feel even more deeply. I certainly believe that my constituent was at the sharp end of prejudice and bias by certain officers of the New South Wales Department. I believe that, as a consequence of that, he and his son suffered more than they should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not happy with the response that I received from the New South Wales Government. Of course, as far as ministerial responsibility is concerned, it stretches over the period in office of both the former Labor Government and the current coalition Government. I am not seeking to intrude party politics into it. I think my constituent has been unjustly treated. He does have a grievance, and I bring it before the House, in the hope that it may trigger a further investigation into the Department's conduct by the current New South Wales Government, because I believe that that would be the right course of action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today concerns the right of the churches to speak out on matters of importance to the Australian community. The Parliament commences with a Christian prayer each day. Most members of the Parliament take pride in the vision of Australia as a caring, Christian, democratic nation, yet even some of these members are not prepared to accept the right of the churches to make considered comment on the sort of society that Australia has become, or on the sort of society it ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the question: can we as a nation afford for them not to exercise an educative role in the community? Can we afford for them to dodge their wider responsibilities and shrink behind the pulpit when controversial questions are being discussed by members of their flocks outside the confines of the church building? Do we really believe that churches have no right to an opinion in our democracy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering this matter, it should be remembered that totalitarian regimes and societies consistently oppose any development of the role of the church in community matters. Where churches are permitted to exist in such societies, they have a specific brief to contain their comment to matters of spiritual guidance. In addition, they may be required to spruik the establishment line, to convey the viewpoint of the powers that be and to preach the doctrine of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not a totalitarian state. It is a very healthy democracy, and I believe that the role of the mainstream churches must include informed and considered comment on the plight of people and the justness or otherwise of Government and Opposition policies which impact upon them. Unless the Christian churches wish to become ever more irrelevant to the lives of ordinary, good-living and well-meaning Australians, they should lead by example and involve themselves wholeheartedly in matters of community consequence and import. To come to this conclusion, we need only ask ourselves what Christ would have done. Did he remain silent when society's actions or values were unjust? Clearly, he did not. The Christian churches are obliged to follow his example and speak out on situations of injustice now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of this Parliament, we have a duty to listen to what the churches say and accord their opinions due weight when deliberating on policy formulation and implementation, as we would any other group representing a substantial and legitimate community view. I believe that we are bound to accept that they have come to a position with goodwill and in good faith, after due consideration of the evidence and in accord with the teachings of their church. As politicians we are free to agree or disagree with the position that they put. It is certainly not appropriate for us to shoot the messengers, nor to abuse them or accuse them of political bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned, in this regard, with the reaction to a recent publication by the Catholic Social Welfare Commission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation and Food</EMPHASIS>. It contains one simple message: food is a necessity of life, and a tax on essential food is neither a good nor a just imposition on the Australian community. This view is one which I share. However, it is not a view shared by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who sees the paper as a direct attack on his proposal to impose a tax of 15 per cent on all goods and services, including essential foodstuffs which are not currently taxed. As a consequence, the National Director of the Commission, Father David Cappo, and his colleagues, including Bishop Patrick Power, have been the subject of unwarranted and unfair criticism and abuse by some&mdash;I stress the word `some'&mdash;members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be pointed out that the conclusions contained in the Commission's paper are firmly based on six principles detailed in an earlier document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foundations</EMPHASIS>. These principles are: the primacy of human dignity, the role of society as the protector of human dignity, the right of people to participate in society, the priority of distributive justice, the promotion of adequate access to resources for every person, and human rights and responsibilities must be honoured and protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document states, at an early stage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the primary goals of a just system of taxation is to ensure distribution of the goods and wealth generated in a community to the most vulnerable and poor within that community. This goal parallels the `principle of distributive justice' contained in Catholic social teachings, which demands that the goods of creation be shared amongst all people according to their need.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A taxation system which places a disproportionate or regressive burden on those who earn less and have less is an unjust system. It contravenes society's responsibility toward the poor and inhibits equitable access to a fair share in society's goods and services. Furthermore, an indiscriminate tax is unable to take into account the amount of income earned. The result is that those on a lower income or with a greater number of dependents pay a higher proportion of their income on essential items, such as food, compared to those with a higher income or with fewer dependents.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a legitimate view, and one with which many Australians concur. It is not a minority view, nor is it a partisan view. It is a view which the Catholic Social Welfare Commission should have every right to express. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further on this matter, I draw the attention of the House to a paper by Reverend Ann Wansbrough of the Uniting Church about the ramifications of Fightback on Australian society, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Christian Response to the Fightback Package.</EMPHASIS> No doubt, Reverend Wansbrough can look forward to being pilloried by some members of the Opposition in the near future, but I do believe that her paper deserves consideration by members of this House, as does that paper of the Social Welfare Commission of the Catholic Church. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in the grievance debate today. I have listened with interest to the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) speak with respect to the goods and services tax, the implications of it, and where we are headed with it. I find the whole exercise somewhat fascinating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that we have got ourselves into in this country is that the Government is having a great deal of difficulty in coming to terms with our major problem, that being unemployment. Of course, one of the difficulties that it has is coming up with an answer to solve that problem. So it goes back to the problem that we have and why the Opposition has looked at the introduction of a goods and services tax as part of an overall package of trying to address the problems that this country has and to get us out of the difficulties that we have got ourselves into over many years. I would concede that some of the problems go back well before the Labor Government came to power early in the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not get over the problem by trying to throw more money at solving unemployment. Different from some other people, I see this problem being solved by the relocation of taxes, which is how I interpret the goods and services tax. In fact, what it does is abolish a number of taxes through the production process and move them to the end of the production process&mdash;to where they are sold&mdash;in the form of that goods and services tax. Yes, we have set it at 15 per cent and it is very easy for the Government to come in here and knock this level of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me just try to work through the process of why it is important for us to address it in the way that we have. Manufacturers in this country over many years have been having a great deal of difficulty in being competitive, and one of the reasons for that is these taxes that occur during that production process. For example, the training guarantee levy, something that has been introduced by the current Government, was introduced for structure training purposes. The Government concluded, from a three-month assessment through Bureau of Statistics figures, that, in fact, insufficient emphasis was being placed on training by companies. It did not care, of course, to look at the level of unstructured training that the surveys that were conducted concluded were being carried out. So it is very difficult, for example, with a cleaning company, for the surveys to look at a structured training program. What normally happens is that the supervisor goes out and teaches the people on the job what they want done in cleaning. So what they have had to do is go out and devise structured cleaning programs at cost to them, which becomes an overhead of their business that they pass on to the companies that they provide their cleaning service for. It is a very simple overhead but, accumulative over the country, it becomes a major cost to our productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at payroll tax. It is true that payroll tax is a tax within the State area, but under the program devised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), under the Fightback program, we propose to get rid of payroll tax. The payroll tax is paid by companies with over $200,000 a year in annual payroll. It is a tax on employment: the more people you employ, the more tax you pay. It is not related to productivity; it is a set rate. If people produce more or less, it is not relevant to how much tax is paid in that area. It compounds when you look at penalty rates that are paid for weekend work or overtime. We collect in this country $5.9 billion a year by way of payroll tax. It is a cost to the production of products that we are trying to make competitive against those that come in from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory superannuation started at 3 per cent, and the Government is talking about fairly substantial figures for compulsory superannuation. I am certainly interested in people's retirements, but I think we also need to look at a number of other aspects of this. As it stands at the moment, it becomes another substantial burden on production in this country. It is another overhead, upon which profits are added. It does not affect just the last company of production. All the way through the production process of components that go into a finished product sold in this country, you have this 3 per cent being added, along with the other taxes that I have described thus far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at fuel excise. Once again, at every stage of production, we have 26c a litre for fuel being added to the costs of a product that is sold in Australia. So, for all the trucks going down the road&mdash;and in fact many of the cars, because in the production process many people use their vehicles to get to and from various locations&mdash;that 26c a litre is adding up. The Government has, through adjustments in the last Budget, reduced the sales tax on many of the vehicles to 15 per cent from 20 per cent, but the cost of the vehicle is an overhead as well. All these costs of the component manufacturers and their profit margins as well are passed on to the final manufacturing producer in the country. Tyres are also affected, as are replacement parts for the vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently $9.4 billion worth of sales tax is collected in this country and it is being passed along the line. Let me try to give the House a very simple example. When the retailer buys a television set from the wholesaler, he buys it at, let us say, $500. On top of that he pays 30 per cent sales tax. So in total he has outlaid $650 for the set. Then he puts it on the shelf for somebody to come along and buy. Whilst it is sitting on his shelf it is an overhead to him&mdash;not only the cost of the set but the 30 per cent sales tax that has been paid. He does not put his profit margin on top of the $500; he puts his profit margin on top of the $500 plus $150 sales tax that he has paid. So it compounds the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went into a toy shop in my electorate and spoke to the gentleman there about the products he had. He was concerned about the goods and services tax until I asked him what percentage sales tax he paid on the items sitting on his shelves. He said that it averages about 20 per cent. So on the $200,000 worth of stock that he had, 20 per cent works out at between $30,000 and $40,000. This is in a toy shop, for heaven's sake. It is a cost upon which he has to apply profit margins to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government can say all it likes about the introduction of a goods and services tax and about how much the burden is going to be at the end of the road, but the fact of the matter is that all of those taxes I have just described are compounding throughout the process of production in this country. That brings me back to where I started out: the major problem that we have in this country, unemployment. If we are to solve the problem of unemployment in this country we have to be competitive. One of the major factors in us being uncompetitive in this country at the moment is the fact that our tax structure is wrong. We must relocate those taxes that compound through the production process to the end of the production line in order to give our manufacturers an opportunity to compete with those products that are brought in from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government is genuine about solving the unemployment problem of this country, it should be welcoming this goods and services tax proposal with open arms. For political expediency, it is not coming up with an answer to those problems of taxes. It would rather knock, argue and deceive people with arguments against the taxes that we propose. I suggest that the Government would do well to look at the proposals we have. They are the only concrete proposals before this Parliament capable of solving in the longer term our unemployment problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to speak about the Holy Family Parish. I want to acknowledge the leadership of my good friend Father Paul Hanna, the local parish priest. He would deprecate any remarks I made about the leadership he has exhibited in all the capacities he has fulfilled, but in the last 12 years we have been delighted to have him as our pastor in the Holy Family Parish. What has he done? Firstly, he takes a fundamental approach to the people in the community of Mount Druitt. That is to say, he believes that they have the innate capacity to take charge of their lives. When we are tackling problems, his approach is not that we need some expert advice but that the people of Mount Druitt have the ability to determine, manage and operate their own destinies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, for 11 years there has been a program for families during the school holidays, operating seven weeks of the year.

It is an outstanding program, and I understand it is being emulated elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past nine years, there has been a literacy program targeted not only to adults but also, I regret to say, to school children.

I also acknowledge the generosity of other parishes in supporting it. It is an outstanding program. I must say that I took particular delight in assisting with getting some government recognition at long last and, I believe, some significant amount of funding for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the point that I want to make.

They have got two full time employees, six part time teachers and, of course, a host of volunteers, all from Mount Druitt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent initiative is a food cooperative. I have never minimised the hardships that people in my electorate have faced and this is another example of taking a local initiative. The food cooperative has been established now, I think, for about 18 weeks. There are 1,500 cooperative members who pay $1 a week and there are some 300 generic brands that are on offer. The cooperative operates, I think, for about three days a week and, given the demand, it looks as though it will go very soon to a five-day a week service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this by way of once again illustrating that some outside experts were called in, but that it was really the people in Mount Druitt who wrestled with the problem of how to make precious dollars go even further, particularly for those most in need. I am pleased to say that volunteers are involved in the service but it has developed to an extent now that one person is actually running the food cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things that I could say about the Holy Family and the tremendous contribution it makes not only to the parish but also to the wider community of Mount Druitt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to the Kid's Activities Centre. In this issue of social welfare, I should say that Mount Druitt has not been free from the situation where we have people coming into the community, working in it, advancing to their degrees as masters of this or that, and then, of course, leaving the community&mdash;in many instances, if I could say, breezing in and breezing out and not making very much change. But Jackie Devereaux is what I would call a pioneering Mount Druitt woman. Some 17 years ago when the then State government had determined that there was to be a new housing commission area, she believed that the then police station which was scheduled for demolition would make an excellent child-care centre. It just grew from there. It grew from something that was scheduled for demolition.

Jackie is a person who does not take no for answer, gets on with it and accomplishes things and, I must say, hardly bothers anyone unless there is a need and then she is very strong. She has obviously provided the leadership there. It has an outstanding garden, a terrific garden, which is right in the centre of Mount Druitt at the shopping centre there.

For good reasons, we are all too familiar with the act of brutal repression which erupted in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

They worship through state-run organised bodies called `patriotic associations' and, officially at least, have renounced their allegiance to centres of doctrinal authority other than the state itself. The remainder worship informally and through discrete networks away from the reach of the Government, maintaining, as is the case with catholics, their loyalty to the Vatican. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would recall that under the brief burst of pragmatism that infected China's international and internal policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, formal Christian worship increased dramatically. The free expression of religious belief, within certain constraints, was permitted to thrive as it might, for the first time since before the cultural revolution of the mid-1960s. Strange as it now sounds in the post-Tiananmen period, the Constitution of 1982 actually ascribed religious freedom the status of a civil right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That expression of universal, fundamental law has since been overturned. In respect of its tolerance for the observance of free Christian worship, the current leadership of the PRC has made it virtually a closed state. The PRC has refused to endorse the traditional democratic separation of church from the political system by requiring the organised Catholic faith to work within the framework of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Furthermore, it has embarked on a systematic campaign to vilify, if not purge the republic of those Catholics who retain links with the Vatican and do not bow to the supremacy of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the West, we may have mythologised the long trials of Nelson Mandela, but there are many hundreds of Catholic Church leaders in China who have faced, and continue to face, the same degree of persecution and whose suffering in the name of a great cause has gone unnoticed, literally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are looking for a democratic hero for the twentieth century, they need look no further than to the likes of the 84-year-old Bishop of Baoding, Fan Xueyan, who has been a prisoner of conscience in China for 30 of the past 34 years. As with many other Catholics in the PRC, the bishop has refused to sever his ties with the Vatican and to allow the secular state to drive the faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sources from Hong Kong report regularly that the PRC has intensified its efforts to suppress Catholicism. There is little publicity surrounding the arrest of lay Catholics and bishops and seldom is there a chance to put names to the anonymous numbers detained. We do know that a fresh drive by PRC authorities to strike at the Catholic underground has occurred since December 1990, under the auspices, sources say, of Document Six. Document Six is known formally by the Party Central Committee as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Circular Concerning Certain Problems in Improving Religious Work</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has no less an objective than the imprisonment of Catholics who refuse, for reasons of conscience, to abdicate the central tenets of their faith in deference to the communist regime. We are constantly receiving information as to the scope of these activities from such sources as Asianews Hong Kong. The most recent updates of incidents on the Chinese mainland include independent collaboration of occurrences such as the following, all of which took place over the period 1990-91. A leader of the Catholic community of Baoding has been sentenced to three years of re-education through labour for his refusal to accept the mediation of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association&mdash;there it is again&mdash;in his church's affairs. His son, and around 55 laymen, were similarly arrested and sentenced to the same period of re-education on the basis of being co-conspirators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auxiliary Bishop of Baoding and some 23 priests and laymen were arrested in December of 1990 and are still held for re-education purposes. Another Trappist priest, Father Pei Ronggui, was arrested while administering the last rites and subsequently sentenced to five years re-education through labour. The Bishop of Baoding has disappeared and is believed to be in a re-education camp with an indeterminate number of those who are described as `his people'. Other laymen of the Catholic Church have been held by police in the same region. They have not been charged and their wives are required to pay for their food and lodgings whilst in the custody of the police. Others have simply disappeared and nothing is known as to their whereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What official PRC sources refer to as `clandestine' bishops have been arrested in the province of Habei. They are old men of the faith in their mid to late seventies and have been critical in holding together the organised Catholic faith in the provinces. According to reports, some have died in custody, such as Auxiliary Bishop Shi of Boading in November of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This much we know, but we do not know just how rife the persecution is in regard to general numbers. Formal Chinese reports only refer to arrests of `numbers of supporters' and `numbers of laymen'. Rarely is it the case that hard numbers of those persecuted can be obtained. The best information we have is of groups of 20 to 30 priests and laymen in a given diocese disappearing to re-education camps at a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one incident alone in 1989, a conference of so-called `clandestine' Catholics was raided by police and 32 bishops and priests were arrested. It has recently come to light that in December 1990 four bishops were arrested for failure to affiliate with the official Catholic Patriotic Association. Reports such as these can be multiplied many times over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the events I have referenced have taken place in the province of Hebei, the north-eastern region which contains a heavy concentration of the Chinese Catholic community. The region is subject to a great deal of surveillance and Catholic worship groups are routinely infiltrated by state police and officials. But we should not assume Hebei is the only area in which arrests take place. Because of the history of religious tension in Hebei, procedures for reporting detentions, arrests and disappearances are reasonably well developed. This is not the case elsewhere and there is a general feeling that much happens that regrettably goes unreported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent information at hand reveals further disappearances this year and the arrests have spread to provinces other than Hebei, such as Fujian. No doubt the political leadership of the PRC has been profoundly concerned, as well it should be, by the interaction between the resurgence of organised religion and the democratic changes which are continuing to move through Eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crackdown by the leadership reveals more than a simple reading of history and contemporary politics on the part of the leadership of the PRC. Its response reflects the profound insecurity which characterises its grip on political power in mainland China. All honourable members of the House should take up the challenge of representing freedom for religious expression in China. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose all of us would agree that the concept of civilisation in a nation is improving the status of all the citizens in that nation. On that note, I raise an issue that was first raised by a constituent of mine, Mr Tim Drysdale of West Lakes. He wrote to the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> last week complaining about the media not having the ability to tell good news stories. He was referring to a very good corporate citizen in my electorate, Adelaide Brighton Cement, which has spent over $124m in a big expansion. Mr Drysdale through various means had tried to get press coverage for what was a good news story&mdash;more employment from a good investment and so on&mdash;but all to no avail; there was no press coverage whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is extremely appropriate to put on the public record another good news story relating to what has been happening in the maritime, shipping and towage industry and the quite remarkable achievements that have occurred in the last couple of years in the reform of the industry. It is appropriate to record it now as the current waterfront reform program draws to a close this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some quite incredible changes have occurred and they have received precious little publicity or deserved acknowledgment. That acknowledgment would go to the membership of waterfront unions and the Seamen's Union in particular. Some 65 enterprise agreements have been approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. They cover changed employment arrangements in all capital city ports and a number of regional ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Productivity in container crane handling rates in major ports around Australia has increased for cellular vessels by an average of 46 per cent and the number of containers handled per employee shift has almost doubled, from 1.25 to 2.35 standard containers per employee shift. This has not been done without cost. Forty-four per cent of the work force has been shed. I have seen precious little reference in any media as to what the Seamen's Union and the waterfront unions have done to improve productivity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average container crane rates in this country for major ports have risen dramatically from 12 to over 18 containers per hour. Average port-wide claim rates have Port Adelaide second to Sydney which, by the way, is almost 20 containers per hour. More efficient container terminals are achieving rates of between 20 and 25 containers per hour. Stevedoring charges have been reduced by 20 to 25 per cent below the rates of just 18 months ago for new business and contract renewals, directly benefiting waterfront users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average ship turnaround times have been reduced by a massive 40 per cent. International performance comparisons show that those crane rates now compare favourably with overseas ports with which Australia trades: Auckland, Osaka in Japan, Tilbury in the United Kingdom and Manila in the Philippines are on a par or less, while Pusan in Korea, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Keelung in Taiwan, Hamburg and Christchurch are now only marginally more efficient than the Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grain handling improvements include a reduction of between 50 and 80 per cent in labour requirements. I would have thought our colleagues on the far right of me would have been acknowledging that in this House. Vessel turnaround times have been reduced from 4 1/2 to 2 1/2 days, while stevedoring costs have been halved, resulting in a total saving of $10m each year to the grain handling industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also extremely pleasing to note that when these major reforms were implemented, from June 1991 to June 1992, industrial disputes, as has been very common with this Government, have been minimal. What a stark contrast this is with the position of the coalition in terms of its threats of troops on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shipping and the towage reform programs concluded at the end of June this year and again quite remarkable achievements have been attained. Average ship crew levels have fallen to under 21 crew members, which matches the level of OECD ships visiting this country. In fact, new ships are being introduced with crews of 17 or 18. The increased labour productivity of the shipping industry work force over the life of the program will result in long term cost savings of $50m per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tugboat re-crewing resulted in an estimated cost saving of some $12m per year. Retraining has been provided to more than 1,900 seafarers to facilitate crew reductions through multiskilling. Over half of the major trading fleet in this country is now operating under multiskilled crewing arrangements, compared with only 10 per cent at the beginning of the reform process. In the towage industry, industry specific training was introduced for the first time and in excess of 90 per cent of the industry has now completed its courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New investments are important to this country. The spending of almost $2 billion on modern, technologically advanced ships has resulted in the modernisation of a third of the Australian merchant fleet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just thought I would bring to the attention of honourable members opposite, the members of the Opposition who wish to introduce a 15 per cent GST, the impact that might have on their supporters. A constituent of mine who was a Liberal voter who runs a record store was telling me that she is looking forward to the day the prices of CDs will drop, when a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax will be replaced by a 15 per cent GST. The only problem that the Liberal Party and my constituent have is that a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax is only $3.39 on a typical CD, whereas a 15 per cent GST is not just applied to the purchase price of the CD but to the $7.61 mark-up which is applied. It means that the total tax added by a 15 per cent GST is in fact $3.68, an increase in the amount of tax which all retailers will have to pay. So it is very clear there is a confidence trick under way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I was here yesterday, and I understand what went on. I am very much aware of what is in this survey. The survey does not suggest in any way that economic recovery is stalling. It says that conditions are improving, but it is pessimistic on employment. It is generally more pessimistic on employment than other surveys of business expectations. There are other surveys around, and consistently over recent times this survey has been more pessimistic than those others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that it has not led the National Australia Bank to dispute the Government's Budget forecasts of GDP growing at 3 per cent; if anything, it says that we have understated the rate of growth of GDP, and still says it. This morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> Mr Oster said in that respect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The growth forecast in the Budget was 3 per cent GDP. We have always been a little above that, and I personally think the Government has probably taken a little bit of downside adjustment if you like to the growth numbers, to try and make sure they are conservative so they don't get exposed to the sort of debate we are probably having now. I have always thought that there's been a downward bias in the growth numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>The forecast by the National Australia Bank for growth this year is 3 1/2 per cent&mdash;above the Government's forecast of 3 per cent. So it is accusing us of being conservative. That remains, despite this survey which was published yesterday. The survey is, nevertheless, pessimistic about employment, and obviously the bank expects very strong growth in productivity. We do not dispute that there is certainly a trend to very strong growth in productivity at present. There have been various attempts to demonstrate that by me and others during Question Time in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it needs to be said that the Government does not accept the view of either those involved in this survey or the NAB that we are likely to have such low growth in employment. We think that they are unduly pessimistic. We think we can have a large increase in employment this year because of an increase in expenditure in the Budget in labour market programs. When I say `large', I mean that the forecast in the Budget was for an increase in employment through the year of 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a $2.7 billion fiscal stimulus coming through from the Budget this year, much of which is very much directed&mdash;in fact, virtually all of which is directed&mdash;towards increasing employment. Three-quarters of a billion of that is for expansion of labour market programs. Much of that goes directly into putting people into jobs through job subsidy programs, through the Jobskills program and so on. We have various other schemes, such as the local capital works program, which is about to have its impact on the economy. Quite a lot of additional employment will be created directly through that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have further substantial capital works expenditure coming through higher education, schools, housing, roads and rail&mdash;roads and rail particularly stemming from the One Nation statement earlier this year. So there is a lot of employment stimulus to come through this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think both the National Australia Bank and those involved in this survey, if the survey reflects their views accurately&mdash;and I assume it does&mdash;are being too pessimistic about the employment outcome. It is worth noting in respect of that employment stimulus that the Opposition opposes it. The Opposition is against having that kind of a stimulus in the Budget. It wanted to cut the Budget deficit by $6 billion to $7 billion. In other words, we would have no stimulus at all; none of these employment creating expenditures. Opposition members stand up here and say, `Aren't we going to have a terrible employment outcome based on the NAB survey', but at the same time they are promoting policies which would certainly lead to a substantially higher level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another business expectation survey for the December quarter was released today, the Dun and Bradstreet survey. That survey shows a rather different picture from that in the NAB survey. It shows that business expectations for orders and sales have advanced strongly compared to the third quarter, and the index of employment expectations is the most optimistic since the December quarter 1989. It says that the expectations for employment for the December quarter rose strongly, with a higher positive net balance of respondents, and that now only 15 per cent of respondents expect a fall in employment. That is in direct contrast to the NAB survey. We see no reason, on the face of both of those surveys, to change our view about either the GDP growth for the year or the employment forecast.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the Minister to the fact that last year Treasury forecast that the unemployment rate in June 1992 would be lower than 10.75 per cent, whilst, in contrast, a Cabinet document leaked to the Opposition revealed that his Department accurately forecast that the rate would most likely be 11 per cent. I ask the Minister: given his Department's superior forecasting success, at least for last year, what are the official forecasts of his Department for unemployment in June 1993?</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, I think the underlying trend rate did come out during last year at about 10.8 per cent and the Budget predicted it would be 10.75 per cent. So to complain about the Treasury's predictions in that regard is a bit meaningless and stupid. They were 0.05 per cent out&mdash;that is fine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the survey that the honourable member quoted in his first question today, the underlying trend rate of DEET's leading indicators is for falls in unemployment throughout this year. Whilst over time, in the period of the recession just past, there has been a substantially greater lag between DEET indicators and the actual movement in the unemployment rate than there has been before, there is now evidence that the unemployment statistics are turning more in accord with the direction in which DEET leading indicators have indicated they ought to have been for some months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition spokesman looked at the leading indicators that my Department releases on a monthly basis, if he looked at the survey of business sentiment to which the Minister representing the Treasurer referred a little earlier on and if he looked at the changes in the ANZ vacancy series, the ABS vacancy series, DEET skilled vacancy series, motor vehicle registration and dwelling approvals, I am sure he would share the sentiment of honourable members on this side of the House. We very much welcome the fact that all those series are now indicating a likelihood of a degree of improvement in employment numbers over this year. We would expect them to be in line with the sorts of predictions that were indicated by the Treasurer in the Budget and in subsequent statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While those who are concerned about what is happening to people in the Australian community would welcome that, it may not necessarily suit your electoral timetable or the timetable that will be imposed on you. Nevertheless, it is important that people take hope from the surveys. They are entitled to take hope from those surveys, because it is an indication that the last of those statistics which turn when the country moves out of the recession, which are the unemployment statistics&mdash;and they are turning slower on this occasion than they have in the past, largely because of enormous productivity gains in the work force with all the substantial labour market reforms that have been put in place&mdash;are nevertheless going in that direction. People might like to contemplate that and the extraordinary risk there would be if the electorate were to indicate that there ought to be a change of government. If that were to happen, we would see the introduction of the biggest anti-employment tax that anybody has ever proposed to be instituted in this country. That is not only our view; the Professor of Economics at Monash University, who advised you, had very similar conclusions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance, representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware of recent reports dealing with the employment effects of changes in the indirect tax mix? In the light of these findings, does the Government have any plans to alter the current indirect tax mix?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2252" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of such reports. The fact that the Opposition proposes to change the tax mix through the abolition of a number of taxes and the introduction of a GST has raised this as an issue in the community. It is often claimed by the Opposition to be employment creating, because it would involve the abolition of payroll tax, which is seen as a tax on employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister noted earlier this week, this is a quite invalid proposition because it ignores the replacement of the payroll tax with another tax on employment; that is, the goods and services tax, which is a tax on value added goods. Value added comprises that value coming from the application of labour to raw materials and the return to capital involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is very much in the category of a tax on employment, most of the value added, of course, coming from employment. That point was made quite unambiguously in a speech in February this year by Professor Freebairn of Monash University at a consumption tax conference in Canberra when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of a long run full employment equilibrium, the economic effects of a broad based payroll tax and a broad based consumption tax are identical.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to substitute a GST for payroll tax to stimulate employment becomes a dubious proposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the short term effect. In view of the comments of that notable economist, it is quite clear that there is no difference between the employment effects of a payroll tax and a goods and services tax. Yet here we have the Opposition continuously saying that because it will remove payroll tax, there will be some great boost to employment, ignoring entirely the fact that it would impose a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Freebairn has had some further things to say. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> there is an article by Paul Cleary headed `Switch to GST will not create jobs, says study' which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of payroll tax as proposed by the Opposition would not generate any new jobs, according to a leading academic who was asked to advise on the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A forthcoming paper by Professor John Freebairn, from Monash University, examines the employment effects that would result from scrapping payroll tax and moving to a broadly based goods and services tax (GST).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis is based on a revenue-neutral case whereby a payroll tax that raises $6 billion&mdash;levied at 7 per cent on 50 per cent of all companies&mdash;is replaced by a 3.2 per cent GST which raises the same amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper finds no difference between the two taxes in the short and long run, except that the GST is more equitable.</PARA>
<PARA>He says that it is more equitable because it applies to all employers, whereas the payroll tax exempts small business. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A GST for Payroll Tax Swap</EMPHASIS>, is the result of 12 months' work and is expected to be published later this year by the Australian Tax Research Foundation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short-run case, the model allows for employment to rise or fall, and it finds the removal of a payroll tax by itself would indeed generate employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the introduction of a GST would offset this benefit because the GST is levied on the "value added" in each stage of production, and a major component of this value is labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect would be identical, except for the different way the two taxes were levied.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members can see from that article that it is very much the view of this man, who was held in such regard by the Opposition that it asked him to advise on the Fightback package, that there are no employment effects coming from the abolition of payroll tax and the imposition of a GST&mdash;in the short term or the long term. But, importantly, in that analysis he is saying that in respect of a revenue neutral tax swap. That is not what the Opposition is on about. The Opposition is not on about a revenue neutral tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;a tax five times bigger than the payroll tax. In that respect, honourable members can see that we are talking about something which, obviously, will have very substantial adverse employment effects on the analysis undertaken by Professor Freebairn. These anti-employment effects are accentuated by the problems of imposing a 5 per cent or more inflation impost through the goods and services tax because of the serious risk of inflation, expectations being increased, consequential rising wage claims and the start of a serious inflationary cycle. The FOI Treasury document which has been bounced around the Parliament in the last few days went to that point and showed that, if that were to occur, there could be quite horrendous outcomes, as the Prime Minister has been pointing out&mdash;a 12 per cent inflation and a rise in unemployment of 170,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to note that this is not just some esoteric exercise. There is every reason to believe that that would be the outcome for two key reasons: firstly, the Treasury analysis says that 70 to 80 per cent of wage and salary earners will be worse off under Fightback and, therefore, it is likely that they will seek to remedy that situation by making wage claims; and, secondly, the ACTU has made it quite clear that it would seek further compensatory wage claims, because it regards the GST package as being damaging to wage and salary earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all of these adverse effects for employment stemming from the goods and services tax, one might ask how it is that the Opposition was able to claim that its policies could create two million jobs. As recently as this week, the shadow Treasurer put out a press statement, again drawing attention to Dr Murphy's modelling of the Opposition's package, which he said defines `the broad direction and magnitude of the coalition's policy changes', but forgot to include the goods and services tax. The only way the Opposition got the two million jobs was to leave out all of these adverse employment consequences coming from the abolition of the payroll tax with the imposition of the GST and all of the adverse employment effects coming from the inflationary effects and the consequent inflationary cycle that is highly likely to occur.</PARA>

They like to be able to stand up and give a single speech which is topped and tailed with abuse of the Prime Minister. That is, when they get up to talk about what their plans are for the country, they do not run through any explanation or argument, they say, `There will be waterfront reform; there will be telecommunications reform; there will be aviation reform.' It sounds like a race call as they go through it. It is basically policy presentation by babble and with no argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the Opposition is that most of its argument about any particular area of micro-economic reform is between 12 months and 10 years out of date, depending on when we decided to address the rigidities and the lack of productivity that they left in office after years and years of inaction and somnolence. We hear very little from those opposite on the subject of communications these days.

Seventy enterprise agreements have been approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority with changed employment arrangements in major and regional ports.

No doubt, he would be overjoyed at these figures. At least as far as the stevedoring industry is concerned, we have a picture of it achieving movement rates across the waterfront equivalent to what is accepted as best international practice. Of course, in grain handling, we have performance rates now that cream the rest of the world. As far as grain handling is concerned, labour requirements have been reduced between 50 and 80 per cent. Vessel turnaround time has been reduced from 4.5 to 2.5 days. Stevedoring costs have been halved. There is a total saving of $10m per annum to the grain industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that has been done without the massive industrial unrest which the Opposition invites the rest of the country to believe is the only way problems on our waterfront can be dealt with. Of course, many of the problems on our waterfront reside in those sections of the waterfront which are controlled by State operations and are beyond the control of the national government. Of course, many of them relate to the modernity of the facilities with which many of these activities are conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these reforms, the stevedoring companies are making changes in those areas. However, sometimes it is argued that the benefits are not being passed on. I will go through one or two figures on that. Stevedoring charges have been reduced by 20 to 25 per cent below the rates of 18 months ago for new businesses and contract renewals, directly benefiting waterfront users. In addition, indirect costs are producing savings almost as great as those direct cost savings. Again, this is good news for the people of this country. It is good news for people who have been concerned about the capacity of our waterfront to serve what is becoming an increasingly export oriented nation. Of course, what it is doing is removing, piece by piece, the would-be emperor's clothes, when it comes to dealing with the issues of micro-economic reform in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might begin by citing a few figures on the sheer magnitude of growth in higher education over the last few years. We now have a university system with well over half a million domestic students. That represents a dramatic increase during this Government's term of office&mdash;an increase of 210,000 since 1983, a 60 per cent increase. In promoting and facilitating that increase in participation, the Government has given particular attention to improving access for particular disadvantaged groups. I will give a few examples. Twenty years ago women were grossly under-represented amongst university places. Enrolments among women have increased 84 per cent under this Government. Enrolments among Aboriginals have increased by 500 per cent under this Government. The number of recipients of financial assistance at the tertiary level has doubled under this Government. There has been a dramatic change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from a recent study by Dr Don Anderson of the Australian National University. In a recent paper, he made a specific comparison of equity of access to Australia's higher education system compared with a number of other countries. His broad conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a relatively more equal social mix in Australia is, I believe, due to a combination of measures facilitating access which are found in few other countries. These include the low cost of tuition, special arrangements for adult entry, opportunities for part-time and external study, and the tradition of young students continuing to reside in their parents' homes.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Don Anderson confirms quite clearly that by world standards we have a highly equitable higher education system. Dr Anderson placed particular emphasis on the question of low tuition costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the future, the Government will continue to fund a further expansion of the higher education system within this triennium. In this year's Budget we announced the initiation of an open learning initiative which, when fully established, has the potential to provide another revolution in access to higher education over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the honourable member's question related to the impact of fees on the equity of the system. The reason I raise this issue is that on three separate occasions the honourable member for Goldstein has put forward as a serious proposition that the introduction of up-front fees will be a measure which will enhance the equity of access to Australia's higher education system. That is an extraordinary proposition. I think honourable members and the Australian public need to know just what the Opposition is on about in higher education. I would like to quote specifically from a speech by Dr Kemp delivered on 10 February this year. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has undertaken to allow universities to determine fees for all courses and all students.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasis the words `all courses and all students'. At various times the Opposition has tried to pass off its position as being one of letting a few people who have lots of dough buy additional places in university. But this quote makes it clear that it is talking about fees for all courses and all students. The half million students in the Australian higher education system need to be conscious of that. As to what the level of fees is likely to be, Dr Kemp stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutions will be free to determine course fees on the basis of relative costs and demand.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the basis on which fees will be determined. What will that mean? What will that imply in real terms as to the level of fees? Dr Kemp, at various times, has quoted a recent report by the Industry Commission on the export of educational services. It contained a very interesting table which tabulated what the level of fees would be under a full fee, demand-driven fee regime. I will give a few examples which are contained in chapter 8 of the report: engineering at Latrobe, $15,000 per annum; agriculture at Melbourne University, $19,500 per annum; veterinary science at Murdoch, $25,000 per annum. If students want to do an arts degree cheaply, they have to pay a mere $9,400 per annum at Melbourne University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of fee levels that might be seen emerging out of a market-driven, demand-driven fee regime. For young people planning to undertake tertiary studies, the more popular high demand courses&mdash;even if the voucher scheme is introduced&mdash;this would mean that, in some cases, there would still be a very large difference that would have to be met. Many of these young people would be incurring debt obligations of a similar order of magnitude, in some cases, to a home mortgage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To seriously suggest that this will somehow enhance equity of access to the higher education system is an absolutely extraordinary proposition. The honourable member for Goldstein has said this three times to the best of my knowledge. I cannot imagine how he manages to rationalise that belief. The nearest thing that I have heard to an explanation of it is that one of my staff did a bit of research and found a remarkably strong correlation between Dr Kemp's uttering of these sorts of statements and the phases of the moon. On three separate occasions it has been within one or two days of, or dead on, a full moon. As far as I can see that is the only possible explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Opposition has said at various times that it will maintain the public's access to funds for higher education. I think the Department of Finance and Treasury in determining the $6 billion hole have been quite generous in many areas to the Opposition's Fightback package. If honourable members read the fine print of what Dr Kemp has had to say, they will see that he has not said he will maintain the funding. He has said that he would continue to maintain the funding at the current level of per student funding and maintain the number of places projected for the triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Government has made funding commitments for the triennium that imply a significant increase in the level of funding per student. It turns out that, even on what Dr Kemp has said, there would be a $300m shortfall between what the Government is providing for higher education and what the Opposition is providing. Dr Kemp talks about providing scholarships. There is no explicit financial provision in Fightback to fund scholarships. He talks about the provision of concessional loan finance. There is no financial provision whatsoever in Fightback to fund the cost of the interest rate subsidies that would be required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of some claims made principally by the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition spokesman on trade over the last few weeks. Of course, it is part of the campaign by the Opposition to find some statistics somewhere talking down Australia's trade and economic performance. The fact is that Australia's trade performance is a success story, both in its process and in its results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has appeared again today. The shadow Minister in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> newspaper today re-ran a largely irrelevant narrow little bunch of figures in order to paint a gloomy picture. He used these in this place some time ago. It really is pathetic that he can find nothing else to back up these false claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister compares market share in six countries. He points to drops of 1 or 2 per cent in our market share between 1980 and 1990. With all the gravitas he can muster, he claims that this shows that something is terribly wrong. When he talks about market share, he conveniently ignores volume growth and the changing mix of imports by Asian countries as their economies develop. He ignores the fact that many Asian countries have come off a very low base and that as they develop they head more and more into elaborately transformed manufactures as imports rather than some of our traditional export goods. This is the basic explanation for what the shadow Minister is pointing to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's exports to the Asian region during the early 1980s were mainly primary commodities. That has given us a structure which is not very well suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in those countries pursuing industrialisation and often, at the same time, protecting their agricultural sectors. The shadow Minister conveniently ignores exactly what the Labor Government has been doing to change that industrial mix and the composition of our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over that period, our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to the region have risen very strongly from something like $591m-worth in 1982-83 to $3.2 billion-worth in 1991-92. That now represents an export greater than our beef, iron ore or greasy wool in 1991-92. We ought to look at the value and the way our export sector has performed. We ought to look at the number of dollars in Australian pockets. In Japan, for example, over the period that the Opposition is pointing to, trying to bring out more doom and gloom and to knock Australia and its exporters, our exports have risen from $5 billion to $13.4 billion; in Hong Kong, $289m to $1.3 billion; in Taiwan, $371m to $1.8 billion; and, in Malaysia, $419m to over $1 billion. Our exports in Singapore have risen well over five times; Thailand, over three times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some perspective on this nonsense being trotted out by the Opposition can be gained when we realise that between 1980 and 1990 ASEAN nations nearly doubled their share of world imports and Australia's share of their imports has been maintained. Our export growth is keeping pace with the fastest growing economies in the world. If the shadow Minister finds something terribly wrong in this record, he should give up, because he is terribly wrong. Our export success is undeniable, and it will improve further under this Government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fully explain Australia's export success, I wish to table a document which points out what the facts are. I will certainly be making this available to all honourable members, and I encourage them to inform their constituents. All Australians share this success story.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has one of the most sophisticated strategies for detecting incorrect payments and fraud in the world today. It aims to achieve three major objectives: first, to prevent incorrect payments and fraud from occurring; secondly, to detect discrepancies at the earliest possible stage; and, thirdly, to deal decisively with the cases which are detected and to create public recognition of the consequences of attempting to defraud the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data-matching program is an important part of the system of controls the Department has in place to achieve these objectives. In the 18 months that the data-matching program has been operating, substantial savings have been achieved and will continue to be achieved through the detection and correction of incorrect payments. The Government expects to save $161.8m this year, rising to $204.2m in 1995-96 from the program. In social security outlays alone, savings of $146.9m this year, increasing to $193.1m in 1995-96, are expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that the data-matching program is a cost-effective means of detecting incorrect payments and fraud, contributing to the framework of controls in place to provide Australia with a tightly controlled income support system. The costs of the program for the Department of Social Security have been associated mainly with the collection of five million tax file numbers and with the implementation of the program. The running costs of the program in future years will be small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most people are honest, there are a few who deliberately provide incorrect information so that they can get more than their proper entitlements. People's compliance with the law increases when they know that the Department of Social Security has effective controls in its system to detect incorrect payments and fraud. When voluntary compliance is taken into account, the savings attributable to the data-matching program reach further than the directly measurable outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also provided for the use of the data-matching program to increase access to additional assistance to families in need. Families with children who already receive a family allowance payment and who may be eligible for increased assistance in the form of family allowance supplement but have not applied for it can be identified through data-matching. Since early August 1992, my Department has issued invitations to apply for family allowance supplement to 50,000 families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people were sceptical about how such a program could maintain a balance between protecting public expenditure and individual privacy. But it is clear that this balance has been achieved in the operation of the data-matching program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Department has fully integrated the privacy safeguards prescribed in the legislation into its operating procedures. Administering the program within such a strict framework has not been without some cost. However, considered against the standards and procedures the Department would have adopted in the absence of externally imposed restrictions, any additional cost would have been at the margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department is working hard, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, to ensure the protection of individual privacy. The costs have been more than offset by the benefits which have strengthened the safeguards already in place to keep personal information safe and secure, ensured that the program is conducted in a manner which avoids any unnecessary intrusion into privacy, and enhanced the Department's capacity to protect public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The low level of complaints and appeals generated by the program are evidence of the Department's careful implementation of the program within the privacy safeguards set for it. I am confident that, after honourable members have had the opportunity to consider the agency reports, they will agree that there are substantial benefits to be gained from continuing with the program. I commend the data-matching program progress report to the House. I present the following papers:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This data-matching program, and the progress report which the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) has just tabled, is the outcome of an amendment included in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act by the Opposition in the Senate. These reports are important for the Parliament to assess how the privacy of citizens is being upheld on the one hand, compared with the savings Government is able to make using the tax file number system on the other. We must endeavour to achieve a fair balance and see that it is maintained between maximising savings and minimising the cost to the privacy of beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has been enforced, as the Minister said, for some 18 months, and the Department has now saved $25.3m in 1991-92. The Government estimated, however, that it would save $290m in this period. This $25.3m excludes running costs of nearly $9m in 1991, presumably during the setting up period&mdash;and $3m in 1991-92. The Minister says that the estimates were not met because the first 18 months has been devoted to implementing this large and complex program. However, surely the Department would have known that collecting five million tax file numbers and establishing matching facilities for them would be a large and undoubtedly complex program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimates are consequently out by some $266m, yet the Government is congratulating itself, saying that substantial savings have been achieved and will continue to be achieved. We hope so. Estimated savings for 1992-93 have been downgraded from the original $300m to $146.9m, not much short of a drop of two-thirds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the data-matching proposal was introduced to parliament, the former Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, repeated the claim that $400m was being ripped off Australian taxpayers by people whom he described as cheats and bludgers. If $25m is all the scheme has saved in its first 12 months, surely there must be something wrong with how the scheme is administered or how the estimates were made in the first place. The Minister for Social Security wrote to Senator Patterson in February of this year. In his letter he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the $65 million originally estimated to be saved in 1990-91 was not achieved because the program has taken longer to implement than was anticipated, including the collection of tax file numbers. However, although there are some essential elements still to be implemented, the program is achieving results.</PARA>
<PARA>That is basically true. There are some results; the real question is whether the results are high enough. Despite his optimism, the results for 1991-92 were a mere $266m less than anticipated. How can we believe, therefore, the new estimates which the Minister tells us that the Department will now meet? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimates of the Department of Social Security are based on the assumption that a 2 per cent residual of clients were illegitimately receiving benefits but were not being identified by monitoring techniques. The 2 per cent is based on a survey of 10,000 family allowance clients taken between June and October 1989. The sample is totally unrepresentative of the Department's client population in terms of how much beneficiaries are paid, why they are paid, how often they are monitored and the methods that may be used to determine whether they are cheating the system. The Minister also says that one of the objectives of the scheme is to prevent incorrect payment and fraud from occurring. Yet the Department detected overpayments and fraud worth $129m in 1991-92, despite the activities of this new structure. This was an increase of some 31 per cent from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these shortcomings, the Department should nevertheless be congratulated on the fact that no formal complaints about the operation of the data-matching program had been lodged with the Privacy Commissioner at the time of the printing of the report. It should also be congratulated on being the only department to take up the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines. I note that to date it is the only department of the five or so which are involved in this program that has even bothered to report to the Parliament. We hope, of course, that when the others finally report they will include in their references how they have applied the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that these safeguards are of ultimate importance to the integrity of the system and to the rights of the individual citizen. There needs to be a proper balance between identifying fraud and protecting the privacy of honest citizens. In 1988 the then Treasurer assured the Parliament that tax file numbers would be administered exclusively by the Australian Taxation Office for tax purposes. He told us that they were designed solely to help reduce tax evasion. They would not apply to benefits where tax instalments were not deducted, nor would they apply to exempt pensions. Finally, he said that the Government had agreed that the tax file number would be completely voluntary. Within two years, all of those assurances were torn to shreds. We now have a totally different system from that committed to the Parliament when the concept was originally developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, data-matching can be a very effective weapon against welfare fraud, but it is not the only weapon nor is it the only solution. While providing enormous resources towards placing the stopper on the bottle, so to speak, surely the economic situation of Australia shows that this is inadequate and that it must be supported by other methods because of the significant increase in the number of beneficiaries at present. There has been a 22 per cent increase in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in 1991-92. The number of claims for pension received in the last year also increased by some 32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making a comparison with the figures in recent decades. In 1971 less than one million Australians were dependent on social security for income support; in 1981 there were 2.2 million people; in 1992 there are 3.1 million people receiving entitlements. Social security and welfare expenditure currently accounts for over $35 billion or 34.4 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security is dealing with 2.2 million pensioners a year, 900,000 beneficiaries and two million family payment recipients. The Social Security Appeal Tribunal had a 31 per cent increase in lodgements last year alone. It is not unreasonable to conclude that, clearly, the social security system is under very great pressure. Consequently, there is a need to reduce the number of people who need welfare. The Opposition believes that this can only be achieved through a fundamental change in policy direction, which in turn can only be achieved through a change of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the ministerial statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Data-matching Program Progress Report for the Department of Social Security and the Data-matching Agency</EMPHASIS> that has just been delivered. I draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), in putting down the statement, indicated to the House that the data-matching procedures are being used to ensure that Australians and Australian families who are entitled to benefits but who are not receiving them can be informed of their entitlement. I have a view that the data-matching process&mdash;to the extent that it is being used to check abuses, overpayments and fraud&mdash;should equally be used to check the entitlements of pensioners and beneficiaries in areas beyond just the family supplement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On previous occasions, I have mentioned age pensions which are paid, virtually on an annual basis, to citizens who are qualified by age, qualified by assets, and basically qualified with certainty by income, an income that will continue to flow week by week, month by month and year by year. Those citizens are often required to report on a fortnightly or monthly basis if their income happens to adjust either upwards or downwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put forward the view that the present administration is unfair to those whose income is falling because an adjustment to their pension entitlement is not made until they actually lodge a claim to report their adjusted income. On the other hand, if they claim that their income is rising they benefit by a delay in the reporting to the outer limits of the administrative timetable, because their pensions are not adjusted downwards until the report is received. So the system operates unfairly to the taxpayer in cases where pensioners delay reporting a rise in income and to pensioners in cases where they delay reporting a lowering income entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the Minister, yet again, the desirability of using this process to match the method of income assessment in the social security system with the manner in which we assess income in the tax system. That involves two things. Firstly, it involves using similar definitions of income in the social security system and the tax system. Secondly, where the definitions are not the same, it involves clearly spelling out on pension forms or tax forms that there is a difference in the definitions used by the Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. Also it should be indicated, in cases where common definitions are used, that that is the case. Citizens need to be informed about how the law describes income in those varying circumstances. We should not put citizens in the position of inadvertently committing, if one likes, a fraud because they believe that a definition used in the tax area can be similarly applied in the social security area or vice-versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second item which I want to bring to the Minister's attention. He has heard me speak on this matter before. I believe that we should use annual accounting in the social security system for long term pension payments, just as we use annual accounting in the tax system. We should use the same kind of annual accounting system used in the taxation system. If, as a result of the receipt of wages and salary, more tax is deducted from my income than is required to meet my tax liability, I will get a refund at the end of the financial year when my tax return goes in; just as if the amount deducted is insufficient to meet my tax liability, I am sent a bill for the difference between what has been deducted from my wages and salary and my tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to Australia's pensioners, we should do the same thing for them. At the end of each financial year they should be able to put in a reconciling return stating their income for the full financial year and indicating what pension they have received. If they have been underpaid, they should be paid the difference. This matching scheme would enable the Department to notify pensioners of their entitlement to a further payment of pension. Similarly, people who had received too much pension could be advised of their overpayment and an account sent to them. In recognition of their relatively low incomes, they could be given time to pay&mdash;as is now the case where the amount to be repaid is deducted from the pension at a rate that is consistent with leaving them with sufficient to live on, notwithstanding their liability to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is particularly significant at present because many pensioners are experiencing a very rapid drop in their incomes. Many pensioners with investment income have bonds and debentures which are now maturing. Those bonds and debentures were perhaps invested three or four years ago at rates of interest of 12, 13, 14 or 15 per cent. As they roll over into today's investments, many pensioners are able to receive rates of interest in the order of only 7, 8, 9 or 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That drop in income is costing those pensioners quite dearly. Not only is their investment income falling but also very often, because they are not aware of the need to report the fall in income immediately, they are being deprived of the level of pension to which they are legally entitled. So a scheme that is designed to ensure fairness to taxpayers and to pensioners alike should be used as a means of not only collecting money from those who are defrauding the system or overclaiming on the system but also ensuring that families and pensioners receive the full entitlement of their pensions. Their entitlement, particularly for long term pensions, should be adjusted on the basis of our normal financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of fairness to those people who depend upon pension income, I urge the Minister to ask his Department to look again at the feasibility of using the technology that it is now developing to ensure that pensioners receive the full entitlement under the law. With the use of modern technology, that would be quite possible. If he does raise that question again with the Department, I hope it will not put it in the bottom drawer and give us the stock answer that it has had for the last 30 or 40 years to the request that pensioners be able to reconcile their entitlement at the end of a financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved, and are moving, into a new era of high technology. We should use that technology in the interests of taxpayers, but we should also use that technology in the interests of fairness to those who are dependent for a substantial proportion of their income on the social security system. I therefore hope that the Minister will take seriously the remarks that I have made and take some action in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a concluding comment in respect of the use of technology. I hope that the Minister will also look at the feasibility of his Department applying to join the computer network that now enables people to use the credit card-transaction card system so that, over time, pensioners will be able to use that technology to their advantage, rather than their money having to be directed into bank accounts, in circumstances where pensioners might themselves prefer to directly draw their pension entitlement on a needs basis from their own accounts held with the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were using paper accounting before the modern technology came in, such a proposal could not have been considered at all. But with the modern technology that is available, it would be not at all labour intensive for the Department to take advantage of those electronic networks that are now being established for the transfer of funds between consumers and those from whom they make their purchases. I think that we should ensure that pensioners, though they have lower incomes on average than others within the community, also get the benefit of modern technology and are able to use that technology just as other members of the community are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the Minister's statement, but I believe there is much more that can be done to take advantage of the electronic system and the computer network that his Department has established and is using now with emphasis on fraud and overpayment. Greater emphasis should be placed on ensuring that not only families but also all pensioners receive the pensions to which they are entitled under the law. </PARA>

The Committee tabled its report in the House of Representatives on 26 March 1992. I commend the Committee for its comprehensive report and recommendations on a very complex and important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that there are a number of matters raised in this inquiry which will require further consultation with the States and Territories. The parliamentary Committee recommended complementary Commonwealth-State legislation and made recommendations on a number of other matters which involve State responsibilities. There has already been considerable consultation, including through several ministerial councils, which would indicate a large measure of support for a national approach. That objective was endorsed by heads of government in their communique from the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference. However there are many details to be discussed and, to that extent, the following statement represents an interim response which may require modification following further consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has proposed an approach which takes account of the wide range of issues in a practical and commonsense way. The Government accepts the broad thrust of the report. Specific responses to each of the Committee's 48 recommendations are set out in the schedule accompanying this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular the Government agrees that the principal concern is that the existing voluntary guidelines and procedures have no legal force. The voluntary guidelines have been very effective for over 10 years, a period during which the majority of projects were in the research phase. Many projects are now developing products for application in industry and agriculture. It is important to establish an appropriate regulatory regime at this relatively early stage in the commercial introduction of the technology, as is being done in many other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach in general terms is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)to give legal force to guidelines and procedures for `contained' research work&mdash;that is research done in facilities specially designed to minimise risks to laboratory personnel and the chance of organisms escaping; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)to establish an effective legal framework for the assessment of all proposals for the `release' of GMOs into the environment. `Release' means the planned introduction of an organism into the environment, usually involving stages of gradually reduced containment as scientific evidence of an organism's behaviour is accumulated and examined before the next stage. For example, field trials of modified plants may involve both physical and biological containment restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy on the regulation of GMOs is based on a recognition that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)the new technologies have much to offer our society, not just in economic or commercial terms, but in improved environmental management and health care;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)like any other living organism, a GMO may survive, replicate and interact with other organisms in the environment and so it is prudent to assess the potential for significant risk to human or animal health, or to the environment; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)there are concerns in the community about the technology and its possible misuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitiveness of firms in many industry sectors of major importance to Australia's economy is likely to be profoundly influenced by biotechnology. Over 70 Australian companies and research institutions are actively developing GMOs for a wide range of applications including food production, agriculture, forestry, environmental management, pharmaceuticals and animal health care. The CSIRO is using genetic engineering in almost half of its research divisions. The regulatory climate for GMOs is important to the successful development of these applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary Committee identified, there are genuine and understandable concerns in the community about the use of genetic manipulation. These concerns have been thoroughly canvassed, not only by the Committee and by the Government in considering this response, but also by a number of overseas inquiries and by the Victorian Law Reform Commission. Various community groups have also assisted by providing submissions both to the inquiry and to the Government since tabling of the report. It is necessary to clearly distinguish the nature of concerns so that they may be addressed appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns are based on perceived risks to human or animal health or to the environment. The principal aim of the Government's proposed legislation will be to provide for mandatory assessment and management of identified risks at each stage from research proposal through scale up and field trials to release of an organism. Some of the concerns raised in the public debate on genetic manipulation relate to ethical or philosophical issues. It is not a denial of the legitimacy of these views to say that they are matters of personal or societal values. As such they are not measurable or assessable in the same way as risks to health or the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several mechanisms by which ethical issues are already considered. Institutional ethics committees and animal experimentation ethics committees already apply guidelines, and the existing moratorium on human germ cell gene therapy illustrates how such issues can be very effectively dealt with through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Committee concluded that there were no grounds for any general bans. The Government considers that the Committee's inquiry has thoroughly and adequately assessed the community's feelings on these issues and agrees with that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is appropriate that individual projects seeking approval be considered in the context of such community concerns. There will be requirements for the public notification of release proposals on which submissions would be invited. All evidence presented which would assist the evaluation of risks and benefits will be thoroughly assessed. On value judgment issues, the Government believes that it would be appropriate for the assessment to use the conclusions of the parliamentary inquiry as a guide to community attitudes. Of course, community attitudes change and new issues may arise. The new Authority described below may draw attention to any such issues as appropriate in its decisions, and in reports to the Minister and the Parliament. </PARA>

The Commonwealth will propose to the States and Territories that legislation be introduced under which the Commonwealth would establish an independent GMA to regulate the release of GMOs, including restricted releases such as field trials. The GMAC will be replaced by a new Genetic Manipulation Research Committee, GMRC. The GMRC will have legislatively defined powers to approve contained research and development of GMOs, taking into account wider issues, such as ethical issues proposed by the GMA.

A membership of up to nine persons will be chosen so that their combined expertise covers genetic manipulation technology, commercial development and use of GMOs, environmental science, health science, environmental or consumer affairs issues and ethics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition I am pleased to speak in response to the tabling this afternoon of the Government's statement in reply to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genetic Manipulation: The Threat or the Glory?</EMPHASIS>  The report, tabled in March, represented a serious and studious examination by the Parliament of the issues facing the community by way of advances in molecular biology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report drew on an enormous range of professional evidence and community consultation from the research community, environmental groups, legal representative bodies and overseas opinion. I would, incidentally, commend the report to anyone in the chamber who has ever had misgivings about the operation of the committee system. The report provides a thorough examination of the issues at hand and attests to the significant and important input of the wider parliamentary system into policy development processes which are of concern to both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this basis alone, the coalition welcomes the Government's response to the good and hard work done by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The report bears on an issue which is of considerable community concern, if not anxiety, in some quarters. As in other areas of scientific research, there is a seemingly exponential growth in advances in molecular biology. Increasingly and steadily, the international medical and scientific research community is gaining mastery over the essential elements of the biological system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this research frontier is pushed back further, its implications for a wide range of public health, environmental, social and ethical concerns become increasingly evident. Manipulation of the genetic system&mdash;be it in plants, animals or human beings&mdash;raises possibilities hitherto rarely imagined by other than the most imaginative minds. But they are possibilities which have now forced their way into reality and they require the attention and careful consideration of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public confidence is critical to the acceptance of new technologies, and work in recombinant DNA is an extremely sensitive technology. It will come to apply to the human food chain and to the development of new pharmaceuticals and it has broader environmental implications as well. We have seen in the past that biomolecular technologies have come under criticism and this is one we cannot afford to see derailed through uninformed debate or public health fears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some two years ago there was an unauthorised release of genetically modified pig meat into the South Australian domestic market and consumer and environmental groups were quick to respond. To be frank, they were well within their rights to do so to my mind. The incident posed a serious question as to the adequacy of the prevailing regulatory systems embodied in the currently established Genetic Manipulation Authority, to provide sure and effective safeguards for the release of genetically manipulated organisms into the environment and the human food chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our knowledge of the mechanisms by which we can manipulate genes and alter the so-called natural biological process has increased, we still know relatively little of the long term effect of the consumption by humans of genes in new arrangements or configurations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the environmental issue is of equal concern. In all cases, we have precious little knowledge as to how new biologically contrived organisms interact with the host environment. We are talking about artificially contrived molecular material&mdash;new life, new biological organisms&mdash;and we do not always know how this responds to the existing ecology. Hence there is a need for controlled field trials and so forth in order to weigh up the outcomes of new research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public response to new food-related technologies cannot be driven by uninformed debate or scare campaigns. They have to be built on solid scientific evidence, thorough testing and field trials. In these areas there is no fast-track solution and no quick fix. We cannot be ruled by impatience or commercial imperatives; we have to do the job slowly and thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to see the new foods get through the regulatory hurdles in the US. There is a future in this market. But Australia cannot jump the due processes. If there are efforts to import these foods then strict guidelines and quarantine laws will need to be applied. But this is exaggerated anyway&mdash;we have an abundance of fresh foods and the new genetically engineered fruits and vegetables are not really required here. They would probably never compete against fresh product and they would have to be labelled appropriately, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing flounder genes placed in fruits to combat the cold and other manipulation of the gene system will prolong the life of fruits and vegetables and allow for slowing the rates of ripening and discolouration. The CSIRO is working mainly on biomolecular control systems for boosting the productivity of crops and animal and plant industries. These are targeted to building in immunities to disease, viruses, fungi and other pests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research is not largely aimed at producing a new food product as such. Regardless, this is a highly commercially prospective technology. It has consumed a massive input of scientific resources. It is a technology which cuts across medical research as well as plant and animal production and processing. This is why we have to be patient and get it right. We cannot afford a knee-jerk response one way or the other. The Committee called for the establishment of a new regulatory body to set guidelines for the release of genetically manipulated organisms. We in the coalition are happy with the idea of strengthening the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee's arm and providing it with more ammunition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is constructing a very detailed system to regulate the whole technology within the laboratory as well as the environment and food chain. On the basis of evidence of past years, it is obvious that a higher and strengthened level of regulation is needed. The GMAC was composed of some very distinguished minds who battled hard to maintain public confidence in this particular technology. Its primary problem has been that its regulatory capacity was based solely on voluntary guidelines. In effect, the Committee was more of a schoolmaster than a policeman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response, which is commendably detailed, may well take us down the road to more effective oversight of molecular biology and all of the research involved. As the Government itself has admitted, there are numerous outstanding concerns which will have to be addressed. These include not just the ethical issues but other matters which will arise as a result of the massive scope of the impact of genetic engineering across every aspect of human life&mdash;food, pharmaceuticals, plant and animal production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the issue of genetic engineering raises broad-based concerns which should be addressed by both sides of the House. They are complex and bear on technical concerns which are well beyond the grasp of honourable members&mdash;and Ministers&mdash;and require the most deft deliberations that the Parliament can provide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the contents of the statement by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) and the broad direction in which he is going. I note of course that it is just an interim response because a lot more needs to be done. As the Minister's response is quite detailed, it is a complex issue and it is difficult to respond in kind to what he has had to say this afternoon. But I want to highlight a number of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology&mdash;which was chaired by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who sits on the other side of the chamber; and I was also a member of that Committee&mdash;took some 18 months or more compiling this report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genetic Manipulation: The Threat or the Glory?</EMPHASIS>. There were thousands of pages of evidence and hundreds of submissions. We travelled the country and we inspected many facilities. We received some very expert advice and, as I think was mentioned when the report was tabled, we received some particularly good advice from Dr Merilyn Sleigh from CSIRO. I have to say to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), that it is not totally beyond the comprehension of members of this place to understand these things. We undertook a very sharp learning curve, but I think we understood quite a lot of it and came to grips with a number of the essential issues. We finally produced a report of some 350 pages, with 48 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is worth remembering why we are addressing this subject at this point in time. There is a worldwide growth in this industry and of course it is now happening in Australia. There is a need for us to make sure that we keep pace with, and remain relevant to, the rest of the world because if we do not have appropriate legislation the rest of the world will look to dump products here. On the other hand, if we are too hard in our legislation we will drive offshore much of the very valuable industry which this country needs to help it on its way to economic recovery. The present rules are voluntary and I very much welcome the Minister's statement that he will introduce legislation to give them the force of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point about the present rules is that they are very fragmented between Federal and State governments. There is a great need to look to complementary legislation between those two levels of government. At the moment there is a very great possibility of abuse in introducing these types of products. It is absolutely necessary, in the unanimous opinion of the Committee, that we have legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of inherent dangers to public safety and health, and those have been dealt with by previous speakers. It is interesting that in the evidence that was submitted to the Committee there was a great divergence of views. Scientists took the view: `Trust us; we don't need any legislation'; environmentalists really wanted to say, `No, we shouldn't be doing this until we know for sure what the dangers are'; business houses had many commercial interests; consumer groups were very worried about the whole area; and a number of people had strong moral, religious and ethical reasons for objecting to the whole field of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, after taking the evidence, the Committee held a round table of a cross-section of views to try to resolve some of these conflicts. The report is very detailed technically. It tried to evaluate those conflicting issues. After publication, I have to say that it was criticised from both sides of the argument, which perhaps suggests to me that we might have actually got it somewhere right because we seemed to please almost nobody. But that is probably not a bad thing. At least it stirred up some interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I am not going to argue about the benefits of whether or not we do it; I want to comment on what the Minister has had to say. I agree that there is, undoubtedly, a need for legislation and new structures. The Minister is to be commended for so comprehensively going in the direction that the report has suggested. There is certainly a need for complementary Federal and State legislation and action. I am pleased that the Minister agrees that we have to do that. Equally, I note that the proposed legislation will take up a case by case approach and evaluation. There is no question, in the view of the Committee and on this side of the House, that that is the right approach. We cannot just apply a standard set of rules to be implemented by some bureaucrats. People with knowledge have to be involved in the process of evaluation. It is too serious not to do that thoroughly in case it goes wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that in recommendations 40, 46 and others the Minister has picked up the two-tiered approach. GMAC is to be replaced by the GMRC as the technical body, and then the full GMA will look at the wider issues. I note that the Minister is going for a different composition, but it is in the right direction. The Committee was very concerned about this and will look at the Minister's legislation in some detail. I notice that he has picked up the point in his statement that it is not just a question of the representation on that Committee; it is a question of people being there with expertise, rather than representing constituencies. I think that is a very critical point in the setting up of that particular body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly urge the Government to legislate as soon as possible. The main difficulty that I have with where the Government is going is that it appears to have backed away a little from a totally integrated approach to legislation. It has let a lot of the existing legislation look after itself. We felt very strongly that there was a great need to pull it all together, because of the need for a national approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take up any more time of the House. I close by saying that I welcome the statement. It is a complex area. There are a number of conflicting issues. If we get it right, there are tremendous opportunities for Australia. I welcome the Minister's statement, and I look forward to an early introduction of the legislation. </PARA>

It is a credit to this House that many honourable members are so interested in the Government's response that they have come into this House this afternoon to listen to the Minister's statement. I think that shows the amount of interest there is in the area of research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that the Minister has struck the right balance between two competing interests. On the one hand, we have an industry which is giving Australia a competitive advantage over other countries in developing plants and animals that have higher productivity, thus ensuring that Australia can produce export goods at cheaper prices. On the other hand, in balancing that commercial interest, we protect public health and the health of our environment. The statement delivered by the Minister this afternoon strikes that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I will give two examples of research in this field which provide great potential for our country. Firstly, a lot of damage is done to cotton by some insects. Work is now being carried out in this field to try to genetically alter cotton so that it produces natural toxins. This means that the pests which would otherwise damage the cotton plant will devour the natural toxins and cease to be a problem for the industry. This provides great potential for the cotton industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example is supported even by the environmentalists who have some concerns about genetic engineering. I hope it has the support of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). I sometimes doubt whether lawyers would have the same understanding that those of us, such as the Minister for Science and Technology and I, who have had to opportunity to study science, would have. The CSIRO is working on a very exciting project to develop a virus which will reduce the fertility of foxes and rabbits. If it is successful, that virus will be confined to foxes and rabbits; it will not spread to other species. It provides an opportunity for us to reduce the damage which has been done to the Australian environment by the plagues of these two animals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should begin by acknowledging that the House has been a total shambles over that period as well. Honourable members will notice a funny coincidence. One would not want to reflect on the Speaker, of course, because of his objectivitity. The unnerving coincidence between one of our members getting thrown out and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being under visible pressure is staggering to say the least. The last two weeks have been absolutely amazing. I think it is instructive just to go back over those two weeks and look at what the Government did not do and how much it was out of control in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. The Government seems oblivious to the pain and hardship that it has inflicted on average Australians. Government members come in here day after day and misrepresent the state of the economy. They spend most of their time being totally negative. There is a constant and incessant attack on us in almost everything they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the telling comparisons can really be drawn between the speech that I made last night and the Prime Minister's recent Chifley address&mdash;the light on the hill address, which, as I recall, consisted of about 13 pages, 11 of which were totally negative. They were devoted to bucketing me, Fightback and the Opposition. That is an indication of how far out of control those opposite are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look back over the last couple of weeks at exactly what has happened. The place to begin is nearly two weeks ago when there was a tremendous win for our side of politics in Victoria. That started it; that unnerved him and jolted him to the very core. As always happens in these things, the only people left standing in the Labor Party are the mad left wingers&mdash;the extreme left wingers&mdash;and the Party sets itself on a path to self-destruction. The Prime Minister came into this Parliament two weeks ago with that as the background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there has been a lot of effort on the part of the Government to downplay the significance of that win, but it was bigger than expected&mdash;that win cut right into the Labor heartland. It has given one of the biggest majorities to our side of politics in the State's political history. The Government knows it, and it has showed the strain in the last couple of weeks. Joan Kirner was just the latest of what has now been a series of dominoes to fall. We have had Cain, Burke, Dowding, Bannon and Hawke&mdash;soon to be followed by Lawrence and, in due course, Arnold.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Paul Keating is next, and they know it. We have only to look at the faces of the Government backbenchers over the last two weeks, when he was up there ranting and raving and carrying on and misrepresenting circumstances and attacking us. The two Government members in the House are probably on the skids. I am not sure of the margin of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), but no margin is big enough to save the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). We just have to look at the backbench; they know that at the end of each week they have to go back and explain to the people of their electorate who are feeling the pain and the hardship of this recession how it is that this bloke has spent his entire time ranting and raving off the point rather than putting in place policies that could turn their circumstances around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my first point about the Victorian election win to our side. We knew the Prime Minister was in trouble soon after that, because he came into this Parliament with a couple of the most amazing statements we have ever heard. Remember that absolute classic when he asked the nation almost to suspend disbelief, when he said that we were out of the recession long ago? He has been constantly embarrassed ever since then by the magnitude of the stupidity and callousness of that remark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend the cartoons that have appeared over the last two weeks; they have had this guy and this Government pegged absolutely correctly all the way&mdash;for example, this one about Pinocchio and the length of his nose growing every time he makes a statement about the recession. The nose is out about 18 inches now, simply because he has made the most inane of the three statements over that period&mdash;namely, that the recession was over long ago. The Prime Minister did not think that was enough&mdash;he had not quite got everybody's attention&mdash;so he went out and said that he had saved Australia. That again showed the extent of the pressure that this man is under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where has this bloke been for the last couple of years? How many times has he gone out of this place and actually met some of those people in some of those difficult circumstances? He has had an invitation from the Wesley Mission in Sydney to go and sit on the Lifeline phone. Do honourable members know what his staff is reported in the paper today to have said? That it would not be right for an untrained person to sit on the end of a Lifeline phone! It is all right to have an untrained character here as Prime Minister, but it is not right for him to listen to the pain and hardship that he has inflicted on average Australians. </PARA>

He will be held constantly accountable for the stupidity and callousness of both of those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to last week's unemployment numbers, which were a very stark reminder of just how far things had slipped. In August alone, 43,800 people lost their jobs. In those two months, 100,000 had actually stopped looking for work; they had given up. What does the Prime Minister do? He comes into the Parliament with another stunt and attacks us. He said, `Some of my colleagues had a meeting with the Catholic Social Welfare Commission'. He said that it was a nasty, vicious little meeting&mdash;and all the other wonderful expressions he used to try to divert attention from the issue of the day, which was the stark reminder of just how wrong he had been in the previous two days when he made those two statements about the recession being over and about how he had saved Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then he was blown out of the water by the Catholic Church, because at about 4.13 that afternoon, after Question Time, we received a letter from Father Cappo which did not reflect the tone that the Prime Minister had said had characterised that meeting. In fact, he expressed his deep and sincere appreciation of the meeting and the team of people who had gone there. He expressed his admiration of our stated commitment to the well-being of all Australians, particularly those who are disadvantaged. He emphasised our goodwill, as exemplified in our willingness to dialogue honestly and openly with the Executive Committee of the Commission. He expressed his appreciation of and respect for our commitment to the well-being of all Australians, and finally said that he looked forward to the continuing good relationship that exists between the coalition parties and the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not stop our Prime Minister. He comes in here in the middle of this week and attacks the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who he says has been belting up priests. He continues to deliberately and knowingly misrepresent the circumstances. This week we have had a whole host of other instances in which the Prime Minister has continued to go over the top. I guess that Government members came out of last week saying, `Can anything else be worse than the week we had last week?'. The answer is yes, it can; John Button can go on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program and tell the truth. He went out and told the truth on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program, which caused the Prime Minister and, I am sure, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) a pretty nasty Sunday afternoon as they tried to get John Button to publicly change his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that John Button was warned after the Channel 9 program that he might have put his foot in it and validated the criticism the Prime Minister got last week for the callousness of those remarks. So he went outside Channel 9 and did a doorstop interview with Channel 10 and repeated the remark, just so that when the Government ultimately lent on him to put out the statement that withdrew it, we would know that he really meant it, because he had had two opportunities to withdraw it. On one occasion he was very conscious of the fact that somebody thought he had made a mistake&mdash;and he went out and repeated it anyway. John Button, having dropped the Government right in it last Sunday&mdash;and his only failing, poor guy, was that he told the truth&mdash;has been beaten from pillar to post most of this week as a result of his basic honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue that concerns most Australians is that through all of this the Government is showing that it has absolutely no answers to the major policy issues of the day. What we have seen is a whole series of policy flip-flops which I think will become particularly alarming evidence of just how far this Government has slipped and how far out of control it is. On tariffs we see the Government trying to run a scare campaign against us. The Prime Minister himself has been a macho man on tariffs for years. The Government took a decision in March of last year to cut tariffs. He went on the John Laws program two days later and said, `We're not just going to 15 per cent for cars; we're going to zero. Tariffs will be gone altogether by the year 2000'. He has been Mr Zero and he is trying to play a little political game on the margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days there have been some hints in the press that he will go in favour of a tariff pause now to try to capitalise on the tariff situation and score a few more cheap political points in this election campaign. I recommend that he go back and read this year's Budget Papers, in which the Treasury made it quite clear that a pause in tariff reduction would be counterproductive. His own departments are on the record telling him that that is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Prime Minister make a major statement on trade in the course of the week when he tried to recover an incredible loss of ground on his part in relation to his statements on trade with the United States. When President Bush made his initial statement that he wanted to further the cause of trade liberalisation and wanted to do that by setting up a network of bilateral trade arrangements between the United States, NAFTA and selected Asian and other countries, the Prime Minister welcomed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went off to Japan. On that occasion he was busily playing domestic politics. What did he do? He bucketed the United States and backed Japan: all the way with Tokyo; to hell with the United States. He misjudged completely the magnitude and intensity of the United States reaction to that, so he came back in here and tried to recover lost ground. He has had Senator Evans in the United States. He came back and told the Prime Minister, `Boy, you have a real problem. You have the whole White House offside; you have the whole administration offside; you will have to back off'. In the space of three weeks we have had three statements on trade with the United States: the first supporting the initiative; the second supporting the Japanese and against the initiative; and the third trying to claw back lost ground and support the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV is another area. Do honourable members remember that? It was announced on television on Laurie Oakes's program on Channel 9. Members of the Government quite often go on television and shoot from the hip. The Prime Minister particularly has only ever shot from the hip. He went on television and proclaimed a brave new world for pay television. A couple of days later, he had already withdrawn from that position. How many channels will we have?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that speech from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was supposed to finish off the Government at the end of two weeks of Parliament, it certainly failed to do so. It was pretty much on a par with the efforts of the Opposition throughout most of that two weeks, which have been, to say the least, bizarre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have spent much of their time suggesting that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not told the truth in various respects, and have taken great delight in parodying him as Pinocchio. They fail to recognise that the same cartoonist who produced the Pinocchio cartoon in relation to the Prime Minister also produced one the next day in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, which was headed `The Pope supports the GST' and depicted a nose that was very long indeed and went round and round in circles&mdash;which is pretty much what the Opposition Leader did this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Opposition is increasingly being demonstrated to be an opposition which is pursuing policies which do not have the answers for the future of the Australian economy. The Opposition is, on the one hand, desperate to take advantage of every little point of negativism that it can to talk down the Australian economy, to suggest that we are not in recovery, that recovery is happening more slowly than we said it would, that employment will not grow&mdash;to seize on every little aspect that it can to try to demonstrate in some way that the Government's economic forecasts will not come true and that we will not proceed into economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition protested vehemently about the true technical statement of the Prime Minister that we were out of the recession. No-one on this side suggested, including the Prime Minister, that that meant that there was no economic pain in the community. Of course there is. A country cannot go into recession and not have substantial economic pain. We are a long way from being in a position where we can all feel satisfied at the level of economic progress and social well-being of the nation. No-one on this side disputes that. We do say, however, that the policies that are being pursued here are as likely to bring this country into economic recovery as those being pursued in any other country which is in recession&mdash;and many are. We also say that those policies stand in stark contrast to those being pursued by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we enter the home run and face up to the line as we come to the election, there is an increasing focus on exactly what the Opposition's policies would mean for this country. We are quite happy to stand on the policies that we have in place, which we believe will lead this country to substantial economic recovery. Growth of 3 per cent this year will stand in stark contrast to the growth rates of most other Western developed countries. It will be a substantial rate of growth compared with those of our major trading nations in the OECD bloc, and we will compare well with the OECD Western countries generally. It will mean that, as we start to bring the unemployment levels down, the Australian nation can increasingly start to come back to the path that we were on in the 1980s, when we had a period of seven or eight years of very substantial economic and employment growth. In that period rates of economic and employment growth were far in excess of those of our predecessor Government, and employment rates were five times those achieved by the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that has not been the case in the last couple of years, but that is not unique to Australia. Recession has been endemic in the Western world. The Opposition pursues a course as though there is something unique about Australia, as though it is only in this country that there are any economic problems and social hardship being incurred because of recession. That is patently untrue. Like so much of what Opposition members say, it is a complete furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we come closer to the election, the focus is on the Opposition to see whether it has the answers&mdash;whether it can produce policies which are likely to give Australia more prosperity, more growth and more employment than would be produced by this Government's policies. As I said at Question Time, the survey of economists undertaken by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> demonstrated absolutely clearly that the overwhelming majority of the economic profession in this country, at least those who were surveyed&mdash;and they were a representative group, some 37 leading business and academic economists having been surveyed&mdash;supported the view that in the next term of office we would see under a coalition government much less growth, more unemployment, higher interest rates and much more industrial disputation than we would see under a Labor government. That is the view of the economic profession as far as this survey can show it, and it is presumably a pretty representative response from the economic profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for the people of Australia to take that into account. The economists of this country, the academic economists in the universities and the business economists, are saying to the people of Australia that we are likely to see under a Hewson government much less growth&mdash;about 1.7 per cent less&mdash;than we would see under a Labor government; a higher rate of unemployment by about 1.6 per cent than we would get under this Government; and higher interest rates than we would have under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are pretty astonishing results, perhaps, for Opposition members to contemplate, because they have prided themselves on being economic purists. But the economic profession is saying to them, `Listen, you guys are pursuing a course which will push this nation into much harder times'. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article suggested, it could even push us back into recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey also quoted the economic forecasting group Syntec, which said that short term interest rates would rise by 8 percentage points over the period; that that would be needed to suppress inflation. Of course, inflation is a key part of what the Opposition proposes&mdash;inflation of 5 per cent at least for starters, followed by the flow-ons that come from the secondary effects. With the wage increases and the break in low inflation expectations that would come with that, we would see secondary inflation effects and, as the Treasury forecasting showed, an inflation rate possibly of the order of 12 per cent. It is an incredible indictment of an opposition that it would pursue policies which could have that kind of outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet those opposite brazenly stand up in this place&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition parades himself around this place&mdash;as though they have all the answers. The Leader of the Opposition is pursuing policies which the economic profession is saying are not the answer. He completely refuses to recognise what is actually happening in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not gilding the lily. We are not saying that we are soaring out of recession. We are not saying that we are producing spectacular economic growth and startling employment growth. What we are saying is that we are coming out of recession and many other important structural changes are taking place in this nation, which we have faced up to&mdash;those opposite would not face up to them&mdash;and which are producing a much better long term future for this nation. No figure better epitomises that than the change that has occurred in exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister mentioned in Question Time earlier this week, when we came into office exports accounted for 14 per cent of GDP; the rate is now 23 per cent. There has been a $36 billion expansion in exports over what there would have been had we not pursued such policies which have made the workplaces of this nation much more productive. This Government has pursued all kinds of micro-economic reform. This has given an array of industries the capacity to export which they could never have contemplated before because they were simply not competitive. Now they are competitive. They can get out there and win export markets. They have an export mentality and approach to the world market rather than to the domestic market only. That is a major change for this nation which will stand us in enormously good stead in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will never acknowledge that such change is taking place. This was clearly demonstrated in the Alfred Deakin lecture given last night by the Leader of the Opposition, which he alluded to in his address. A whole array of statements in that speech demonstrate his complete delusion about what is happening in this country. For instance, at page 4, the Leader of the Opposition says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a massive growth in government regulation, government expenditures and government bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA>That gives the impression that under this Government there has been enormous growth in the government sector. That has not happened. It is just something that exists in his mind. Government sector outlays as a percentage of GDP have been no higher under us than they were under the Fraser Government. They are the third lowest in the whole of the OECD. To say that big government is the cause of Australia's economic problems is a complete absurdity which could be uttered only by an economic ideologue, but I will come to that interesting point in a moment. At page 6 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . today Australians have to cope with some of the most inefficient and expensive utilities in the world . . . educational standards declining relative to the rest of the world . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Our utilities are going through a tremendous transformation. Utilities such as our power industry, our telecommunications industry and Australia Post are all achieving major productivity improvements and reductions in costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the evidence for saying `educational standards declining relative to the rest of world'?  We have had an explosion in education. There has been a tremendous increase in the number of students completing school and going on to university, with virtually a 70 per cent increase in university places. There is no evidence for his saying that our educational standards are declining. The Leader of the Opposition goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A freer and competitive market system creates a more equal, fairer society&mdash;a society where people can work hard and improve the standard of living for themselves and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds to me like trickle down economics, to use the current American expression&mdash;that is, we do not need a government sector of any substantial size in this country to redistribute things; we simply need to have the market working and all the benefits will trickle down and everyone will benefit. It does not work like that. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that, he must be one of the very few people in this country who do. Then, amazingly, at page 7 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no room for economic ideologues in economic policy making or in politics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Fancy this man, of all people in this country, saying that when he is an economic ideologue par excellence. There is no better description of the Leader of the Opposition than that. He has a completely rigid view about economic policy, so much so that he will not even recognise that the economy&mdash;which he is hoping to preside over one day&mdash;has been transformed markedly in the last decade and that he is pursuing policies which are just inappropriate to that economy. At page 10 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unremarked tragedies of the last decade is the destruction of Australia as a classless society and the constant attrition of workers' living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>If he thinks that we were ever a classless society, that is more evidence of his being an economic ideologue. Real wages increased last year and will increase this year. We are not facing continuing reductions in workers' living standards. At page 11, in relation to the waterfront, the Leader of the Opposition talks about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's high-cost, rort-ridden and delay-plagued waterfront and shipping services.</PARA>
<PARA>He completely ignores the fact that there has been a transformation in both of those industries. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) said in Question Time today, there have been marked changes in the waterfront with a 100 per cent increase in productivity. There have also been very large increases in shipping. To say that we have a waterfront which is `high-cost, rort-ridden and delay-plagued' is to describe what it used to be in the days of the Fraser Government; not what it is now. At page 13 he talks about big government: `Big, bloated and intrusive government'. I have already covered that point. At page 15 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most striking features of contemporary Australian debate is how one side of politics is re-fighting yesterday's battles of worker versus capitalist, English versus Irish . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know who is doing that. We are not doing that. We have not been encouraging any kind of conflict between worker and capitalist. In fact, the opposite is true. We have had a lot of industrial peace under this Government. Who the hell is stirring up a fight between the English and the Irish? This bloke is locked into the last century. This really does sum him up: his economic vision is of last century. It is a vision of a world in which the market is dominant and in which the Government has a very small role to play. It does very little, if anything, about redistributing the wealth of the nation. It lets people who cannot make it fall through, because there are no safety nets. It is a world in which the unions do not exist; or, if they do, they are there to be beaten up and there is no law to protect them. His economic vision is of a world in which the market is supreme and there is no opportunity for people who do not have economic power to really make it. That is the kind of world in which he belongs. It is the kind of world in which all members of the Opposition belong. It is about time the Australian people recognised that that is what they are. </PARA>

Of course he has a right to refer to various church organisations&mdash;the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence&mdash;and the opinions of various prelates advanced one way or another in respect of economic debate. But it is a quantum leap from that to describing, for example, the Catholic Church as being `tribal' and all the other twists he has added into the national agenda in this last fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally will not forgive the Prime Minister for that sectarian twist at such a difficult time for this country and for the division that it creates. We have long since graduated from that very difficult period in the 1950s and 1960s when, as I am sure you would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, issues such as state aid were the subject of extremely divisive debate on both side of politics, within families, within schools and within regions of Australia&mdash;especially within the Goulburn region which adjoins Canberra. We need that like a hole in the head. I believe that the circumstances are such that the Prime Minister should walk into this House and say, `I have been wrong to raise the sectarian issue in the way I have, and I apologise for doing so'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only issue on which the Prime Minister has been wrong. I refer quickly to the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS>, which states, `Keating wrong on roads'. Let us have it out on this road user charge issue. The publication states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is now clear about the `Fightback!' debate is that the Prime Minister has got it completely wrong about road funding. He was saying only in the last period of parliamentary sittings that the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) had estimated the cost of running Australian roads was around $4.3 billion whilst the GST applied to petrol would only raise about $750m. Mr Keating then goes on to construct an argument that Dr Hewson will therefore have to raise $3.5 billion through a tax on every kilometre driven . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was yet another case where the Prime Minister was wrong. He was applying the goalpost to Fightback but suddenly, as a matter of policy on the Federal side, we had to find funding for all levels of government, in totality, from the taxation reform that we have proposed. Nothing is further from the truth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS> further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the Hewson Government win office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it goes on to point out the exact position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to match One Nation's Commonwealth road funding contribution in the first year of the GST&mdash;1994-95&mdash;it would only have to provide $1549 million (including the untied funds for local government). This is a long way from the $3.5 billion Mr Keating has been talking about. As the GST would provide half of this amount, reaching $1549 million even without any road user charge on heavy vehicles would not be difficult for Dr Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, we are clear-cut on Fightback. Motoring will be cheaper; freight will be cheaper. All fuel excise taxes will be abolished&mdash;petrol, diesel and the avgas fuel excise. According to the Treasury figures, the transport sector will gain the following: the abolition of payroll tax, $121m a year; the abolition of fuel excise, $679m a year; the abolition of wholesale sales tax, $408m a year. The net GST payment will be $58m. Total savings for the transport sector will be $1.14 billion&mdash;no ifs and no buts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the House: let us have a bit more honesty in this economic debate on the road user charge issue. There will be no road user charge on the individual motorist, beyond the individual payment of the GST on petrol and diesel. That represents a net saving of 20c a litre or $11.40 every time we fill the average size fuel tank. Wayne Goss was here yesterday. He had the Wayne Goss plan for business incentives and jobs. This is what he thinks of payroll tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payroll tax cuts for 6,000 Queensland businesses. Payroll tax abolished for businesses taking on apprentices and young and long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is backed up by the statement of Keith De Lacy, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members should remember that payroll tax is a tax on wages, and a savage one at that.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Treasurer of Queensland. He said, `Payroll tax is a tax on employment, a very savage tax'. Tom Burns, currently the Deputy Premier of Queensland, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is absolutely incredible that any Government would allow payroll tax to become its major source of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>A report in 1977&mdash;the Prime Minister spent much of that period arguing very strongly for a massive reduction in payroll tax&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Keating yesterday defended the ALP's proposed payroll tax abolition from charges by the Coalition parties that this would mean handing money to big companies . . . `Our policy . . . is not a gift. It's removing a disincentive to unemployment'.</PARA>
<PARA>Flip-flop Keating! Here he is, yet again, saying one thing in that critical period&mdash;advocating the reduction and abolition of payroll tax&mdash;and today coming in to this House and saying that it is not necessary to abolish payroll tax. We are one of the few countries in the Western world persevering with a pernicious payroll tax which creates a massive disadvantage in relation to fair dinkum job creation. It is an absurdity to say that small businesses will not benefit from the abolition of payroll tax. Of course they will. They will benefit indirectly because so many of their input costs come from larger companies which do have to pay the payroll tax, the burden of which will be eased by our actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade issue has been dealt with very capably by the Leader of the Opposition. In terms of export performance, I remind the House that we are looking down the barrel of a gun at an ESD Bill which will create another 20 Coronation Hills, if the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has her way. She will just read the cover of a submission on a project; she will not read the detail. She will sign a bit of paper and we will lose another Coronation Hill project. I remind the House, for what it is worth, that Coronation Hill would have generated 630 jobs nationally, it would have generated about half a billion dollars in total export income, and it would have produced some 1.2 million ounces of gold. The coalition unequivocally states that we would proceed with that project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enough of the Prime Minister's flip-flops. It is time he faced the people honestly. It is time that we had an election to clear the air; to provide a real agenda for getting this country back on the rails. Short of that, in retrospect, I have to say that Robert James Lee Hawke is looking a whole more credible as the Prime Minister that he was than this Prime Minister whose shabby treatment we have to put up with for a few months or a few weeks longer, until the Labor Government is thrown out of office at the next election. </PARA>

One has only to have sat through and listened to that last performance to realise how true that is. The Leader of the National Party says what a terrible thing it is for the Labor Government to bring up sectarianism. Let me inform him that sitting in this chamber is an honourable member from his side of the House who has put out a very interesting press statement today. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), has put out a press statement headed, `Liberal attacks church bias'. According to the press statement, the honourable member:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . contrasted the Bishops' statement with the `frenzy of often ill-informed comments by other church people'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Who was the honourable member referring to as making `ill-informed comments'? He was referring to comments such as those reported on the front page of last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS>. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Essential food must be as accessible as possible to all Australians. It is a matter of justice', said Father David Cappo.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was supported by New South Wales President of the Saint Vincent de Paul society, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The society in New South Wales has been concerned about the goods and services tax as it affects those in greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We note with interest the comments of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and would support in principle the exemption of food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Clearly, we don't support the taxation of essential food items.'</PARA>
<PARA>There we have quite reasonable comments from groups such as the St Vincent de Paul society saying that it is unfair and unjust to tax food for the poor and low to middle income earners. What result do we get? We get a sectarian attack from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, saying that those comments are ill-informed. Yet the Leader of the National Party comes in here and attacks our side of politics for bringing up sectarianism! Perhaps the Leader of the National Party can talk to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition so that they can get their stories straight. The Opposition side of politics is not averse to a bit of sectarianism, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister at the table says, they have not changed their story, and the statement put out today by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) demonstrates that that is so true. I was fascinated by the speech given this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). There were 15 minutes given to him, and for 12 minutes we had a rambling dialogue, a commentary&mdash;through pretty rose coloured glasses&mdash;on what had happened in parliament in the last two weeks. It was only in the last three minutes that he actually got around to talking about his MPI, the economy, tariffs and all of the other issues. It simply demonstrates the very clear difference between the Labor Government and the Opposition on the economy and what the Government thinks should be done to boost the recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the Opposition has been put to the test on three occasions on what it can do to help get Australia moving again. When we started reducing interest rates back in 1990, what was the view of the Opposition? What was the view of the Leader of the Opposition and the other senior spokesmen for the Liberal Party? They opposed the reductions in interest rates which this Government has brought in time after time since 1990&mdash;over 14 of them, I think. Almost every one has been opposed by the Opposition. It did not want interest rates to come down. Like Max Walsh, it said, `The recovery is going ahead too quickly; the economy is overheating'. Every time there has been a reduction in interest rates it has been made despite the opposition of the Liberal and National parties. On occasions, they have actually attacked the independence of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, saying that it was wrong for him to allow interest rates to fall. One can just imagine how high unemployment would be if interest rates had been kept at the levels that the Opposition wanted. That is the first occasion on which the Opposition failed the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second occasion was in the One Nation statement when the Government brought in a package that sought to boost employment by carrying out infrastructure projects right around the country&mdash;road, rail, airlines, and seaports. In my own State of New South Wales we had the Government allocating funds to build a dedicated rail freight line all the way from Campbelltown to Enfield so that freight trains would not have to be at Campbelltown for a couple of hours waiting for the peak hour trains to get through; it is a reform and a rail construction project that is for the good of the country. We have the Government bringing forward proposals to extend the national gauge to improve rail freight transfers throughout the country. This would get freight off the roads and back into the rail network by making rail more efficient. It is doing the things that create jobs and are good for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the Opposition's response to all of those national infrastructure projects in One Nation? It opposed every single one, whether it was road, rail, airlines, or seaports. It was against every project and every attempt by us to create jobs and to help build national infrastructure. So it failed the second test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third test was in the August Budget, a Budget that provides massive sums of money to boost job training, to provide Jobstart subsidies to get people jobs in the private sector, and a local capital works program that will mean local government throughout the country will be able to carry out projects that will benefit the local community and help boost local economies and boost jobs. What was the Opposition's response to that? It opposed that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on the three major tests&mdash;on interest rates, on the One Nation infrastructure projects, and on the Budget proposals to boost employment&mdash;the Opposition opposed every single measure. It has the hide to say that the Government has prolonged the recession, when every single measure that the Government has introduced to try to boost employment and encourage the recovery by kick-starting the economy has been opposed by the Liberal and National parties. They have got a hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to other aspects of the Fightback package. Those opposite say that now is the time, as the answer to all of Australia's problems&mdash;now that we have got the recovery starting to build up momentum&mdash;to impose a new tax, a 15 per cent tax on food, clothing and services. Imagine what that is going to do to the cost of cereals, dairy products and meat where there is no wholesale sales tax reduction to come through. Imagine what that will do to the cost of clothing. It will mean about a 12 per cent increase in the cost of clothing&mdash;</PARA>

Even on postage stamps, people will be hit by the 15 per cent consumption tax. At this time, when we have got the recovery starting to build up momentum, those opposite want to impose this new tax on the country&mdash;a tax which those opposite say `cross our hearts and hope to die' they will never increase above 15 per cent. We can trust them as much as we can trust any government around the world that has brought in a consumption tax, because every government has increased it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a matter of great concern to consumers. But it is of greater concern to those people in businesses throughout the country who will also be affected. Imagine all of the 700,000 small businesses throughout the country that are going to have to fill out this paperwork Sunday after Sunday, week after week. Imagine how much paperwork is involved in calculating 15 per cent tax on every transaction that takes place in a small business. Even the little old sporting clubs are going to have to fill out all this paperwork. They are going to have to charge a 15 per cent consumption tax on admissions into footy grounds and on sponsorships. It is really going to destroy the whole concept of local community sporting groups, and there are many other areas that are going to be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one proposal that the Leader of the Opposition did get around to mentioning, three minutes from the end of his speech, was his tariff policy&mdash;a policy that is going to drive the Opposition's vote through the floor, because the Australian people will not cop zero tariffs. Australians know that in the car industry zero tariffs mean zero jobs. We have had Ford say that it cannot guarantee the future of its new factory. We have had Toyota say that its massive investment in Victoria  cannot be guaranteed with productive output if zero tariffs come in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I intend to make a short statement on behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities outlining the Committee's program between now and the next election. The Committee is currently inquiring into a proposed new legal framework for the incorporation and regulation of small business. We are in the midst of a program of public hearings which will be completed in Perth next week. It is the Committee's intention to report to parliament on this matter by the end of November 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its responsibility to monitor the general area of corporate law and regulation, the Committee has recently met with representatives of the auditing and valuing professions. Arising out of that meeting the Committee will conduct a short investigation into the introduction of a requirement for audit committees on the boards of all publicly listed companies. The advantages of such committees are that they help to preserve the independence of auditors and ensure that supervision and knowledge of the audit function is vested in the full board of the company, not just the managers. The Committee will produce a report on this subject by the end of this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is also currently developing a proposal for a thorough redrafting of the corporations law. In introducing the Corporations Bill in 1989 the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, stated that the purpose of the Bill was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . establishment of a national scheme for the regulation of companies . . . the Bill for the most part, re-enacts the existing legal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>While some tidying up took place, it was essentially a consolidation of the law. Reform was to come later. Since the passing of the corporations law there has been a steady flow of amending legislation. Five amending Acts of varying complexity have been passed and two major Bills, the draft Corporate Law Reform Bill and the proposal for continuous disclosure, are in preparation. The Committee believes that this piecemeal process of reform will produce an increasingly cumbersome piece of legislation. There are already 1,371 sections, including a section 1076ZC&mdash;and the Act has been in force for less than two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of a redraft are, firstly, that it would allow a thorough examination of the principles and concepts of corporate governance which underpin the law; for example the relationship between ownership, that is, shareholders, and management has changed fundamentally, yet the law has not kept pace with those changes. Secondly, practical experience gained in the working of the national scheme of corporate regulation could be built on to refine the law, for example with regard to prospectuses and takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a review of the contents of the Act may enable some parts of it to be hived off into separate legislation. For example, would the insolvency provisions be better placed in an insolvency Act? Fourthly, advantage could be taken of developments in legislative drafting to produce a clearer and more accessible piece of legislation. For example, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has been widely praised for its wholesale revision of the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that this process should take place over a period of perhaps three years to enable consultation with all interested parties&mdash;the States, the business community and the professions. The Committee will fully develop this proposal and table it in parliament by the end of this session. I stress that the Committee is not planning to redraft the corporations law; rather, it is suggesting the development of a proposal for a long, bipartisan, consultative process leading to a thorough redrafting of the corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its continuing responsibility for scrutiny of the ASC and its associated agencies, the Committee will review their annual reports, hold hearings where necessary and report to the Parliament on any significant matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is mindful that with a general election imminent it is unlikely that any new long term inquiry will be finished in this Parliament. However, the Committee will develop a reference on the emergence of major institutional shareholders, particularly superannuation funds, and their significance for the corporate law and corporate regulation. Issues which will be considered include whether the investor protection role of company law is relevant to these investors, the influence of institutional shareholders on the stock market and the influence of large institutional shareholders on the governance of companies. The Committee will seek submissions on this reference early in 1993 and prepare the ground for its successor in the next Parliament to complete the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the light of press reports drawing attention to calls by the Business Council of Australia and the Institute of Company Directors for an inquiry into criminal and civil law enforcement by the ASC, I refer honourable members to the report of the Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Relations Between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions</EMPHASIS> tabled in this House two days ago in which at paragraph 1.6 it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will not seek further hearings with the protagonists at this stage. It believes that it is important that both organisations be given the opportunity to give effect to the Attorney-General's guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore rejects as premature the calls of the business community. </PARA>

<PARA>Two factors have prompted me to ask the House to adopt this significant package of changes to the Standing Orders. These are, firstly, that many of the arrangements which regulate the proceedings of the House apply by virtue of sessional orders&mdash;orders that will cease to have effect with the prorogation of the Parliament or the dissolution or expiry of the House. It is time that the House determined whether these arrangements should be adopted as ongoing standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is proposed to alter the title of Chairman of Committees to Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees to reflect the importance of the dual functions that the occupant of the office performs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With relation to the adoption of sessional orders as standing orders, none of the proposed changes are new to honourable members. All have applied in this Parliament since its first day of sitting on 8 May 1990, with some minor changes. In fact, many of the significant matters, such as the days and hours of sitting, the routine of business and the establishment of the general purpose standing committees have been in force on a trial basis as sessional orders since 1987, and in some cases since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When proposing the present raft of sessional orders to the House on 8 May 1990, I said that it was my desire to move for their adoption as standing orders in due course. At the time the then Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), said that the Opposition was of the same mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion, if passed, will not change any of the existing arrangements but it will offer some very real advantages. It will reduce the number of important but essentially housekeeping matters that require urgent resolution in the first week of a new parliament or session. It will enable the present membership of the House to determine whether or not such important reforms as the system of general purpose standing committees and the arrangements for private members' business should be confirmed as more permanent features of the operation of the House. It will avoid asking members newly elected at a general election to make decisions on a range of matters affecting the operation of the House of which they have little or no knowledge. Passage of the motion will not restrict in any shape or form this House or the House in the next parliament from making further changes or reverting to past practices either by ongoing Standing Orders or by trialling sessional orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Deputy Speaker's position is concerned, the terms of the motion relating to the proposed alteration of the title of Chairman of Committees to Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees are intended to reflect in the Standing Orders the significant responsibilities exercised by the Chairman of Committees as Deputy Speaker of the House. I stress that the purpose of the amendments is to reflect the dual functions of the office. It is in no way intended to derogate from the importance the House attaches to the role and duties of chairmen of committees which are specified in a significant number of the existing and proposed standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should this proposal be agreed to, the House, when considering the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Amendment Bill currently before it will be requested to agree to amendments to reflect the change of title and the definition of Deputy Presiding Officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first element of this is quite an important act by this Parliament. There is no doubt at all that the changed sessional orders that we are now here inserting in the Standing Orders have upgraded markedly the position of the private member in this place. It will enshrine in the Standing Orders a committee system which is working well and which has produced a number of useful pieces of scrutiny of both policy and general administration by the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, the enshrining of special arrangements in place for private members on a Thursday morning is particularly important. It has to be said that these are not propositions which are much in the interests of the Executive. It is probably that fact which led to these being so long in coming in this place. I must say about Thursday mornings that, while the procedures are very much set in place, and were always defended by members by the skin of their teeth, frankly it is not terribly convenient to government that a very substantial proportion of Thursday is taken up with private members' business or scrutiny of government. Indeed, it is now 20 past five in the evening on this Thursday and this is notice No. 1 of Government Business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do realise that one or two other things, other than private members' matters, have occurred prior to this point. But on the day on which we start at our earliest, at 9.30 in the morning&mdash;we have gone for the course of sitting slightly longer than a normal working day&mdash;we are only just getting to Government Business. The two weeks on and two weeks off type of operation, which was introduced largely at the behest of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), as he was concerned for the health of members, and the fairly strict restrictions on evening hours so that we no longer sit until two or three in the morning, have impacted substantially on the capacity of government to conduct business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a legislature, a constitutional system, which is enormously legislatively oriented. I cannot think of any other parliament on earth which passes the amount of legislation that this body does. So there will always be a desire on the part of the Executive to see sacrifices by private members in this area. It is a good thing, I think, that that will be somewhat inhibited by these propositions going from sessional orders, where one has an opportunity to do something about them if one happens to be on the Executive at the beginning of a new parliament, into Standing Orders, where if one wishes to do anything about them as a member of the Executive one has to be very heinous indeed in one's behaviour. I think these changes have much to commend them to the House. It is quite obvious that we have had plenty of time to experiment with them and that they have worked well. </PARA>

I note, Mr Speaker, that you have returned to the chamber to listen to the debate: I thank you for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House rightly said that some of the Sessional Orders have been in place since 1983 and have been renewed in each successive parliament. The reason that he gave for trying to consolidate these matters into the Standing Orders is essentially a housekeeping matter. But these Sessional Orders relate to matters that impact substantially on how the House conducts itself. I think all of us are looking to get some sense and good order into the way the House conducts its business. We always look for simplicity in the proceedings. I think the step we are taking today&mdash;and it is a significant step, taken in a bipartisan way&mdash;reflects well on the Parliament. It does not, of course, indicate that either side of this chamber for all time says that the Standing Orders will stay as they are. Many of us have views as to how they might be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there has been a raft of reports from the Procedure Committee over a long period relating to a whole range of matters to which the Parliament has yet to respond. Later in the afternoon members of the Procedure Committee will be speaking about those matters. So we are not precluded from revisiting these issues. On other occasions&mdash;today is not such an occasion&mdash;I have referred to the fact that we on this side of the House have views about some Standing Orders needing to be dealt with more thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at the end of a two-week sitting period there is a lot of focus on the Parliament and how we conduct ourselves. Again, today is not the day to canvass issues about Question Time and so on. But it should be stated clearly that the coalition parties, through their Leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), have stated that we believe we have to make a commitment to improving the functioning of the Parliament. This does not reflect on any particular persons or on any offices they might hold, but all of us need to recognise that things can be better than they are, and we want to make a commitment that we will take the opportunity to do that when we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sessional Orders that we are now adopting into the Standing Orders relate to things such as the 2 p.m. starting time for Question Time. If this were not adopted as a standing order, in a new parliament one could have a situation where on some days Question Time could revert to 10 a.m. I believe that is not conducive to the functioning of the Parliament. It is recognised now in the broad community that Question Time is at 2 o'clock. That is a good time to start, so long as an Opposition has an opportunity to ask as many questions as possible and gets short and succinct answers. But that again is a matter for debate at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House talked about private members' business. Most members appreciate very much the chance they have been given to further the opportunity for private members' business. Indeed, in the period that I have been a member of parliament there has been a dramatic improvement, and I think that is good. We want to make sure that those matters are sustained in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some concerns that perhaps the 90-second statements that give backbenchers and others an opportunity to raise matters prior to Question Time need to be visited. From my point of view, the 90-second statements do provide a good opportunity to raise issues. The Selection Committee was created to determine who should get the positions for the available time on a Thursday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion also deals with the 11 p.m. adjournment. Interestingly, we have suspended Sessional Orders by way of a resolution of the House to negate the 11 p.m. adjournment for the rest of the year to make sure that the business of the House is dealt with and that we do not get cramped up at the end of the year, thus requiring additional sitting days. It is somewhat ironic, perhaps, that we are debating a matter of Sessional Orders becoming Standing Orders when at the present time we are acting under the suspension of those Sessional Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some elements of our procedures are not so good. I do not know whether sitting through the lunch hour is good or bad, but many members have a view about that. As to the sitting pattern, the Leader of the House mentioned that it was largely at the behest of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) that we sit for two weeks on and two weeks off. I wonder whether that is the optimal sitting pattern for the future. We need to consider that. Perhaps we ought to be sitting in more distinct lumps at two particular times of the year, having breaks over Christmas and in the middle of the year. All those matters could be visited; they certainly need to be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Leader of the House is from Western Australia. This proposal was primarily for the benefit of Western Australian members so they would not have to travel such vast distances on so many occasions. Many people forget that, although we have a democracy in this country, the travelling undertaken by honourable members is extensive. We need to provide the opportunity for honourable members to perform dual functions. They are asked to be legislators and they are asked to be representatives. Trying to meet both of those requirements is demanding physically on all of us. I think we need to look for regimes that are conducive to meeting those two roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all want to elevate the status of the Parliament; we do not want to belittle the institution. We recognise that in recent times there has been more involvement of the Parliament in the broader community through the medium of the televising of parliament. This is something I welcome. We always need to enhance the televising of parliament and to make it more relevant to the community. As the spokesperson for communications, and knowing that the medium by which most people get their information is through that box in the living room, I think that the rules we have to determine how the processes of the House are taken beyond Canberra are extremely important. We need to consider that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, members of the Procedure Committee will be making some comments. One of the disappointments is that a lot of Procedure Committee work has been done and we have not visited that as a parliament. We certainly need to do so. There are concerns about committees. Admittedly, the committees are working much better than they were. I have been very active in committees since being a member of this Parliament and I have found that work to be particularly important, although at times I have been a little disappointed at the responses from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that sometimes the committee stages of the actual Parliament&mdash;rather than the committee work of the Parliament&mdash;are such that we do not take full account of what we could be doing in terms of going through a piece of legislation. It might be that we could look at this area as well to perhaps tie up the work of standing committees with the committee stages in some way so as to avoid the problems that we saw, for example, with the superannuation legislation, the swimming pools legislation and, I am sure, a lot of other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of today's motion is to be supportive of the institution, to make sure that we are taking some decisions to buttress our democracy, because how we operate in this place reflects on each and every one of us. It does not constrain any of us to come back to change these Standing Orders. Indeed, there is every likelihood&mdash;it is almost a certainty&mdash;that I will be back here at some stage with a proposal to vary how we conduct ourselves now. Today is not the day to have a debate about all the other issues that could be canvassed, other than to say that we are under much greater scrutiny in this Parliament by virtue of the televising of parliament than we have been in the past. It is incumbent on all of us to make a commitment to adhere to the Standing Orders to make them work. Today's motion is a small step in the right direction and it is pleasing to see that it is a constructive step. </PARA>

Most of these reports were made by the Procedure Committee when either Mr Keogh or Mr Mountford was the Chairman. I do not think any of them arose from the last three years. That is disappointing, in that a very substantial review of the Standing Orders has taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sessional Orders which are today being put into the Standing Orders involve some of the major changes that have been made in the manner in which this Parliament has been conducted over the last 30 to 40 years. The provision for private members' business has changed what was an occasional occurrence, which occurred when the Government did not have anything better to do, into a regular feature of the Parliament which is attached to every sitting Thursday&mdash;and to date, in something like 4 years, has not been taken over by the motion that Government Business take precedence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that in one parliament, in the not too distant past, the thirteenth item of General Business was not reached in a three-year period. It was almost a joke to try to stand up and debate a General Business notice which had been lodged on the first day of the sittings of the Parliament three years earlier and which had absolutely no relevance, other than historic memory, to the current events in the country. But that is the manner in which we conducted General Business at that stage. On the other Thursday we had grievances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an improvement. A lot of development can take place which will largely depend on the will of the House and the wish of the Executive of the day. I believe that some matters which come before the House could be better dealt with as private members' business. I also mention that the Family Law Act was dealt with as private members' business. I seem to recall that it was before the Parliament for three years. There are those who would suggest that that was not long enough; it should have been here for 20 years. Nevertheless, a large number of recommendations from the Procedure Committee are still outstanding. I do not think any of them are radical in the sense that they go to the heart of the problems which this Parliament has. I have advocated for many years that we should conduct our business differently. We should use plenary sessions and committee sessions of the Parliament and have provision for the multiple use of committee sessions of the House during sitting times. That has not been adopted. It was adopted at one stage in 1983, but it has never been adopted or tried in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of plenary sessions and committee sessions would add to the time available and would allow the House to return to a situation where debates on major items of policy could take place. I think the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) alluded to the fact that this Parliament is jammed with legislation to such an extent that very little else is able to be considered during the periods of sitting which we have accepted as members as being the maximum we are prepared to indulge in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament has changed materially in the period that I have been here. There are those, both inside and outside the Parliament, who seem to think that we can fix or change the way the Parliament is conducted by writing new Standing Orders. We cannot. The changes that have taken place in the Parliament, including in Question Time, have taken place under virtually the same sets of Standing Orders that have existed for the last 40 to 50 years. The members have changed, the methodology has changed, the way in which the Opposition functions and the way in which the Government functions has changed&mdash;they have all changed as a consequence of developments which have taken place in the Parliament. When Arthur Calwell was Leader of the Opposition he was not the same as Gough Whitlam. That difference is reflected in this House today. When Menzies was Prime Minister he was certainly not the same as Paul Keating, and he was not the same as Bob Hawke or Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances under which we conduct our affairs have changed, but what has changed most is the fact that parliament is now reported in the media in a manner which is not conducive to this type of debating chamber. In the nineteenth century honourable members debated at great length; for the majority of this century they debated at great length. They do not do that now. If they do, it is for their own private consumption. It is impossible to get any speech reported in the media at any length, no matter how good it is, where the public will see it. We are operating under the constraints of a 30-second grab on the television news in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question Time is designed as a political forum. The questions which are asked&mdash;and we hear complaints about answers&mdash;are questions which bear very little relevance to the seeking of information. They are seeking a headline in the television news or to make a political point. The answers do not provide information; they answer the political point which is made in a question; or they answer the dorothy dixer which is set up to enable the answer to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should run away with the idea that what we are talking about is going back to something which may have existed in the past, and probably did, but certainly has not existed since Gough Whitlam became the Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament. He changed the nature of Question Time and television has changed the nature of the reporting of parliament and the manner in which members seek publicity. They do not seek publicity by making speeches or in debates here; they seek it outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the House any longer, but I urge the Leader of the House to provide the opportunity for a very wide range of Procedure Committee reports&mdash;not only the present one&mdash;to be debated and at least brought to the stage of Sessional Orders. There are some very significant matters, and some matters which were considered at the time as matters of urgency: for instance, the rules relating to the hearing of in camera evidence and the rules which govern the activities of members resulting from that were put to the Procedure Committee as a matter of urgency. It is the better part of 12 months since the Committee reported on those matters and they have still not come forward. There are other matters which are also of importance, one being whether or not the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) sits in the chair at the start of the next Parliament, if I can put it that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole area of the opening of parliament, the election of the Speaker and matters of that nature have been dealt with in some detail by the Procedure Committee. In the case of the election of Speaker and the opening of parliament, this House actually carried resolutions supporting that proposition before the Procedure Committee made its report. They have not been introduced and, if they are to apply at the start of the next Parliament, they would have to be introduced as Standing Orders during this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that the Parliament continue to evolve its Standing Orders and that it change its procedures where it is necessary in order to meet the requirements of the business it has to do. With this motion we are putting the Procedure Committee into the Standing Orders for the first time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that updating the Standing Orders is essential, and this is the first time it has happened since we have been in this new Parliament House. The Sessional Orders which are now to be written into the Standing Orders certainly include some which I agree need to be adopted as standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to touch on some of the matters addressed by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) as well as deal with a few others. The dynamics of this place really revolve around you, Mr Speaker. You, more than anybody else, are the person who makes this place tick. Sure, it can be said that you are the referee and the players, as you have described it in other places, are the parliamentarians who sit here and participate in debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But while the person in the chair is there nominally to interpret Standing Orders, I see the role of the Speaker as being beyond that. To me, the role of the Speaker is to interpret everything which is not written&mdash;and what is not written is far more significant than what is written. If the Parliament is to work, it is critical that the person who sits in the chair&mdash;and of course, it is not only you, Mr Speaker, but also your deputies, who have the same responsibilities for the time they occupy the chair&mdash;tries to make sure that it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry at the moment&mdash;and the honourable member for Corio addressed it&mdash;is that the dynamics of television, in particular, have changed this place. I accept that the personalities of the leaders, the run-down to an election and all sorts of other factors intrude; but there is little doubt that the way in which Question Time dominates the whole of the parliamentary process distorts what, to me, is the most important part of a forum where issues of major public substance can be addressed and considered. Hopefully, it is not just a matter of laying down an ideological point of view, but also accepting that there are reasons for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because, as the honourable member for Corio suggested a moment ago, we are bogged down in legislation. I think there is far too much legislation. I was delighted when the concept of sunset clauses was introduced because it means that we at least have a chance to begin again. The most notable example of legislation gone mad is income tax legislation. All we have to do is look at the volume of it and compare it with what was there a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that every time we legislate we do not rewrite the whole of a particular law. So in order to know the current state of the law, we have to go back through successive volumes, look at earlier Acts, and look at the application of one particular subsection or part of a subsection in relation to an earlier clause. It becomes extraordinarily difficult. As far as litigants are concerned, they have to worry about case law, judges, the judiciary and the precedents which flow from them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that, as law makers&mdash;and that is our predominant role&mdash;we fail pretty miserably. We complicate the law; we do not make it easy to understand by those in the community to whom we have a responsibility. So I begin by looking at the process of the Parliament and wondering whether we should not do a lot more to try to make that process work more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I find very difficult as far as the Standing Orders are concerned is the fact that on each occasion we have met as a parliament we have not adopted the  Sessional Orders which were there before. We have modified and adapted them, and I guess that will continue. But there is a paradox. On the very occasion when we are talking about adopting these Sessional Orders, standing order 103 and sessional order 48A are under suspension. I think this makes today's proceedings an absolute farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that we have to get through all of this legislation. We heard the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when he moved the motion, and I guess I have done the same thing before. But the point is that at the time when we are addressing the question of whether we should write procedures into our tablets of stone because we think they are the right ones to follow, we already have a sessional order and a standing order under suspension. I have no doubt that as soon as this motion is out of the way the Minister will give notice that the two Standing Orders&mdash;as they will be when they come into effect on 3 November as a result of this motion&mdash;will again be suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How ridiculous it is. What the hell are we doing? We are here talking about writing into tablets of stone Sessional Orders which will be suspended on the next occasion we meet. I think that puts part of the process of this place into proper perspective. I think the Government has failed miserably in a number of policy ways, but it is not just by way of policy that we should be concerned about democracy in this place. We should be concerned about procedures and practices and the way in which there is scrutiny of the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing worries me. I am glad that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is here because she produced some excellent figures about the conduct of Question Time. It is not just a matter of how many questions are asked or how they are answered. The real difficulty concerns what used to be a fundamental folklore in this place: if a Minister had a significant policy statement to make, if possible, it would be made in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the present practice. If Ministers have a significant policy statement to make they make it outside this place. I know it is a lot easier&mdash;they might get a better press run, they can answer the press queries and make sure the headlines are right. But more and more statements are being made outside the Parliament and we then have a process whereby a Minister comes in and arranges for a series of dorothy dix questions which enable him or her to explain what the policy is about. That is really the only opportunity that the Parliament gets to consider the matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not followed the practice of the British Parliament in having green papers and white papers. We have had the odd one or two and they have been the exception rather than the rule. For a while we developed the practice&mdash;and I do not think it has been followed adequately for many years&mdash;of producing ministerial statements to foreshadow policy which would often commence from the date of that ministerial statement. This meant that the Government had an opportunity to expose what it intended to do by way of legislation and it provided some opportunity for some scrutiny of that legislation to be before it became legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really goes to one of my fundamental concerns. It is not just a matter of what the role of this place is; it is a matter of whether or not we fulfil that role and how we do it. I mentioned a moment ago my worry that legislation is too complex. One of the problems is not only that it is complex but also that it is not even examined in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we have these ministerial statements and they are debated, it is rare that those ministerial statements are debated in the detail with which the legislation needs to be debated. We have had several examples of this in legislation which has gone through&mdash;in some instances because there have been amendments in the other place; but in other instances because it is jolly difficult for the Parliamentary Counsel to go through each of the clauses of amending legislation in the detail which is necessary and then see not only the constitutional position of that amendment, but also how it relates to other pieces of legislation and whether or not it is as it should be. We are constantly getting amendments which would not be necessary if we had a better process for the scrutiny of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at our Standing Orders, I think it is important to work out whether or not, in their present form, they will meet the requirements of our prime task. What is our prime task? I think it is to debate meaningfully&mdash;not just expose on television&mdash;policy positions which relate to the governance of this country. And that policy position is not something which comes just by way of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We rarely have a fundamental philosophical debate in this place; we rarely have an opportunity to consider the whole embrace of where we should go. Of course, there are occasions in the Budget debate and in Appropriations generally when we can talk in the broad. But we do not look, for example, at issues relating to the Australia-New Zealand relationship, or what the position might be regarding the changing strategic situation in the world in these post-Cold War days. We might have a ministerial statement about an overseas visit&mdash;as we had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) the other day&mdash;and there might be some opportunity to talk about foreign policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what about the people issues? What about the unemployed? The fundamental policy problem in Australia at the moment concerns what many of us accepted as a doctrine of faith: if there were more than 2 per cent unemployed in this country it was something of which we should be ashamed. That has long since passed. When did we last really look at the whole question of employment, opportunity and the social consequences as a policy issue&mdash;not in relation to some new benefit, or how it affects a particular program which is on the legislative agenda; but in relation to the people concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of issues that I would like to see addressed in the Parliament. I have mentioned only two: one in relation to foreign policy and the other in relation to people policy. I suggest that, if we are not going to have white papers and green papers, we ought to have a few more statements from Ministers by which we can open up some of these issues. They need not and should not necessarily then lead to a piece of legislation. They can, but they may not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that flows from that is how we get our legislation through. I sympathise with the problem of the Leader of the House. It is almost impossible to get through the program. It is made worse because of the Macklin-type resolution in the other place. There is a schedule which means the Government has to get its legislation to the Senate by a certain time or the Senate will not be prepared to debate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we go about it? Although I was opposed to it in days gone by, I would like to see in a sessional order another experiment with legislation committees. Whether we could use our standing committees to look at selected pieces of legislation, I am not sure. But I think we need to recognise that too many of those clauses that pass through this place need to be changed for one reason or another very shortly after they have been passed. It is not just a matter of politics; it is a matter of particulars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to see how we can make our committee stage process worth while. Frankly, our present committee stage process is a farce. All we do is repeat the general debates that we have at the second reading stage. I know that there are all sorts of reasons for it. Some people occasionally might address a particularity in the legislation in that committee stage, but we are not really looking at the detail in the way that somebody needs to. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has generally done a very good job. But I do not know that we in this place can pass legislation to the other place and say, `It doesn't matter; we don't need to do it. Somebody else is going to look at it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my worry. We do not want to make this Parliament irrelevant. Turning these sessional orders into standing orders does not make this place relevant. It does not overcome the abuses of Question Time. It does not mean that we will get more worthwhile questions and that people are going to debate each other instead of being out there portraying a 30-second grab on television. All this means is that we will have another set of standing orders which will be amended by sessional orders, I can guarantee, as soon as the next Parliament meets. It certainly means that, either tonight or immediately after this legislation is passed, we will get a notice from the Leader of the House to suspend two of the new Standing Orders so that he can continue with the business of introducing what he sees as the necessary parliamentary program in order to complete his legislation before the Macklin resolution in the Senate takes over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not opposed to the idea of re-dating or updating our Standing Orders; indeed, I think it is essential. Our sessional orders are supposed to be just that. If sessional orders are to be repeated&mdash;and many of them have been repeated&mdash;they should become Standing Orders. Some of the changes made by the Government have been exceptionally successful. I think Question Time at 2 o'clock works brilliantly. There is little doubt that private members' day is far better than the procedure and practice that I followed as Leader of the House. There are other changes that I think are very worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us not confuse the totality of our responsibility.

Tonight we are doing what we wish we could do much more often; that is, to have a general debate in which ideas can be put forward and canvassed, albeit that the outcome will be a narrow and pre-ordained one. The thing that concerns me most about what has been happening in this chamber recently is the role of Ministers as they see it in relation to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again I have sat in your chair, Mr Speaker, and witnessed Bills being introduced by Parliamentary Secretaries and second reading debates being replied to by Parliamentary Secretaries. The Ministers concerned are now very rarely in the precincts of this chamber when we are debating their legislation. I think the very least they could do is to read their own second reading speech or at least have a Minister read it, but they should certainly be here to reply to the second reading debate on their Bills. When that will happen is not so unpredictable; in fact, it is quite predictable these days. It is a very poor measure of the way this Government sees this chamber that its Ministers do not present themselves at the times when they have responsibility for very important business before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment was made earlier in the debate that the time for private members' business has improved dramatically. Compared with what happened before, that is undoubtedly true. However, a number of things need to be kept in mind. This Parliament is significantly larger than the Parliament that was in existence when the Labor Government was first elected in March 1983. More members need to speak to Bills and other matters to put before the Parliament the concerns of their constituency and their concerns about particular areas of government activity and national issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sitting hours and the sitting pattern have not helped that situation. It is good that we have the private members' debate on Thursdays. I would not agree with doing away with sitting through Thursday lunchtime, simply because that is another hour and a quarter of private members' business. Since we have moved into this chamber, there has not been any difference in outcome between speaking during lunchtime and speaking at any other time. We have in this chamber now the pinnacle of interest that we will get for any debate, apart from Question Time, and we have nine members present. The outcome of speaking through lunchtime is no different from the outcome of speaking at most other times in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 90-second statements were commented on. I think they have proved themselves well. I was highly sceptical about them when they were first mooted and introduced. However, from time to time I avail myself of those 90 seconds. It is a useful period. Again, the pity is that it is not a little longer, because it does not allow a very large number of honourable members to speak. If it were a more regular occurrence&mdash;perhaps each day&mdash;it would be an outlet for many honourable members to make brief statements on matters that were of concern to them or their electorates and which they thought should be brought to the attention of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time for debate on reports and ministerial statements is something that concerns me very much. We cannot talk about any of these things without looking at sitting hours and the sitting pattern. I will not presume to come forward with what I think the sitting hours and the sitting pattern might be in the future. Back in 1981, I was part of a committee appointed by the then Fraser Government to look at proposals for changes in sitting hours. Honourable members are very good at saying off the top of their head, `These are the hours we should sit'. They do not realise the ripples that spread out when one casts that stone in the pond, in terms of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporting and all sorts of things that are built around the hours that we sit and the costs that flow from those. However, we need to look very closely at our sitting hours, because until we do that we will not be able to improve the amount of time available to private members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England has had a lot of experience in this place, mostly as a Minister or shadow Minister. I have been here over 18 years but have not spent any time as a Minister, although I did have a little time as a shadow Minister. However, I can claim more time than the right honourable member for New England as a backbencher, so I am aware of how backbenchers are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never cared for the present sitting pattern of two weeks on and two weeks off. We are neither fish nor fowl. I am not advocating the old sitting pattern of three weeks on and one week off but I preferred, when Parliament was in session, being essentially concerned with attending to the business of the Parliament. We went home to our electorates and had a decent break of one week out of four, catching up on those things we cannot do on the run when we are rushing around commuting every week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came back after that week's break, we knew where we had left off. Two weeks on and two weeks off is fine for the two weeks I am here&mdash;although it is an extremely intense time because I have to condense into two weeks what used to be spaced over three&mdash;but after I am immersed in my electorate for two weeks I come back here and think, `Now, where were we; what were the committees looking at; what was it that we were doing?'. I suggest that we look at having a more intense sitting pattern, such as sitting two weeks out of three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sit as many days as we do because the Senate keeps recalling us at the end of June and just before Christmas. I am enormously relieved that we no longer sit almost until Christmas Eve, as we sometimes used to do. Whenever the Senate sits right up until Christmas, I always think it is clear who organises Christmas in honourable senators' households. Nevertheless, we will again be coming back just before Christmas to finish off the business sent back to us by the Senate, in the same way that we come back at the end of June. That used not to happen; business completed by the Senate after the House rose would be carried over to the next session. I am not being in any way critical of the Government. I know that it has legislation that must pass through the House and then come back, because it has been amended, and still get through by a certain time. However, to some extent this masks how many days we sit and how much time we spend on new business. Precious few days are spent on anything like new business; as a general rule we rehash old business. The simple arithmetic of it all is that we sit seven days out of 28, whereas previously we sat nine days out of 28. The time available for private members' business has increased, but only within that seven-day period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the Labor Party coming to government its spokesman on these matters, Mick Young, had much to say about all the reform that was going to take place to such things as sitting hours. What he brought in when the Labor Party was first elected was worse than had existed, and the situation has been improved only a little by the loosening up of time for private members' business. Members of the Labor Party involved in the sitting hours exercise in 1981 and 1982 said that they had hoped for something better out of the Labor Government, but they were sorely disappointed by what Mick Young brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we have changed our procedures in the past does not mean that we cannot do so again. I am afraid that we have a government that has run out of puff when it comes to reform. If there is one thing that is needed for parliamentary reform from time to time, it is a new government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedure Committee reports are very important, but they sit awaiting comment and proper debate. The Committee must have a proper look at our Standing Orders. The issues that are raised in the reports are important and we need to look at them. The risk is that we will get so worn down and have so many parliamentarians who have never known any better that we will lose interest and do nothing about it. However, it is important that we do look at these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community in general has a jaundiced view of Parliament and the way we conduct ourselves, particularly during Question Time. I was not in favour of televising Question Time because I believe very much that the medium is the message. I was a member of the Parliament in 1974 when we had the joint sitting, and I saw how people behaved when Parliament was televised. It was different from how they behaved when the television cameras were not on them. My personal view is that it was not to the benefit of Parliament at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I deplore the fact that it is now so hard to pick up parliamentary broadcasts on radio. It is impossible for people to listen to parliamentary debates, certainly in my part of the world, if they live outside the range of some weak little transmitter in Brisbane. I do not think either of those changes has been any sort of advance. The opportunity for honourable members to participate in debates on policy statements, green papers, white papers and ministerial statements is more important in terms of the input that individual members can have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time day after day we see a most extraordinary boilover of frustration by honourable members on both sides. That frustration results from the way business is arranged, the rules under which it is arranged and the way in which those rules are implemented in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak in support of this motion. I certainly can understand the cynicism of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and appreciated the comments of those who have had the benefit of many years experience as members of this place. As someone who is relatively new to the Parliament, I guess I look at these issues from a slightly different perspective. It is clearly an advance that Sessional Orders that have been somewhat in a state of limbo for so many years get a degree of permanency by being established as Standing Orders. That is a welcome step forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be said, however, that even with this advance what we are doing today is still a generation behind the Procedure Committee, which has presented some 10 reports to the Parliament recommending changes to various aspects of the Standing Orders, only a handful of which have been acted upon. Some of them take a step forward today, and that is to be welcomed. I would like briefly to go through each of those 10 reports and make some comment about the likelihood of their eventually proceeding to the stage where they become a part of the day to day activities of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990 the first of the reports dealing with the debate on committee reports came into this Parliament. As a result of that, some additional time was provided for committee report debates. That will become a standing order as a result of today's motion, and that is welcomed. In November 1990 the Procedure Committee made recommendations in relation to standing order 132, concerning the response to petitions. The Committee had actually recommended that Ministers be required to respond within 21 days to petitions that come into this Parliament. I think that was a very meritorious recommendation. A large number of petitions have been presented, and that number has increased enormously over recent years. The Committee report actually provided statistics in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of effort goes into presenting petitions to this House. Many petitioners would be disgusted if they knew how little notice this Parliament takes of the work that is put into preparing those petitions to the House. Whether there be two or three signatures or tens of thousands, the Clerk merely refers to them and that is the last that is heard of them&mdash;although I understand that they are stored in the vaults of this Parliament for the benefit of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Committee recommendation, a sessional order has been agreed to, which becomes a standing order today, which means that Ministers now may respond to petitions, but it is a long way short of a requirement that they respond. I am pleased to note that one or two Ministers have responded to petitions, but I am sorry that this has not become a general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1991, some changes were recommended in relation to private members' business and the establishment of the Selection Committee. It is good to see that these also become a part of the Standing Orders today as a result of this motion. In June 1991, the Committee recommended the establishment of a citizens right of reply to enable people in particular circumstances to respond when they have been referred to in this Parliament perhaps in a derogatory way. The Government has not responded in any way to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1991, there was perhaps the first of a series of recommendations to commence a comprehensive review of the Standing Orders by the Procedure Committee dealing with Standing Orders 1 to 11A regarding the procedures on the opening day of Parliament. As was mentioned earlier in this debate, amongst those recommendations is that the father of the House should take the chair for the election of the Speaker. It also deals with the actual physical procedures on the day in relation to where the opening occurs, and things of that nature. The Government has not responded, and obviously if there is not a response within the dying days of this Parliament, nothing will be in place for the opening of the next Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), in his contribution to this debate, there was also a report on the issue of disclosure of in camera evidence. This was referred urgently to the Committee following disclosure of in camera evidence from the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The Committee responded as requested promptly, but there has been no response from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another quite important, though obviously not monumental, report in relation to the seconding of private members' notices of motion. There is a proposed change to standing order 133, which has become important now that we have independent members in this House who may not be able to obtain a seconder for any notice of motion that they would propose. Again, there has been no response from the Government, but I commend that proposal to the Government which would obviously give independent members a capacity to put things on the agenda of this Parliament which they may not currently be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992, there was a committee report on the procedures in regard to the election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. Again, there has been no response to date from the Government. There is a need to do something urgently if those changes are to be in place in time for the new Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1992, there was a very important report. It dealt with perhaps the most vexing question that is associated with consideration of our procedures at present, namely, what we are going to do about Question Time. The Committee adopted a mildly radical approach in its recommendations. Again, there has been no response from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the tenth of those reports was presented which deals with disciplinary procedures. Naturally, there has been no response from the Government, but I do not chide it for not yet having responded to that report. The report recommends some changes to the way in which members are suspended, the penalties which apply, and the introduction of a sin-bin type procedure for members who may not have offended quite as grievously as to warrant a suspension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee has been working diligently. Its Chairman, the honourable member for Corio, has certainly put a lot of effort into looking at what can be done to improve the procedures of this House. I commend those 10 reports to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee still has ongoing work to do. There are still a lot more Standing Orders that need to be reviewed, and some of them need quite elementary changes. The fact that we have moved into a new building that has different physical features means that some of the Standing Orders need to be changed; for example, there is no longer a gallery on the lower level of this chamber. The Committee is also working at removing the sexist language from the Standing Orders, and I think there would be no disagreement that that ought to be done. These are matters which I would commend to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and to the Parliament as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt at all that the fundamental question of how this Parliament works is now being looked at by the wider community. I think that the public perception of the way in which this Parliament operates is affecting the regard this House has throughout society. I read a letter to the Editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 15 September from a young constituent of mine, Rowan Hine, from the Wondai State School. He wrote:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed how all the political parties seemed to have no real concern about the state of the country&mdash;and were more concerned about putting the other party down.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to comment about the way in which the Parliament operates. I took the opportunity to reply to him. He was obviously here during the Budget sitting, and I suspect also during Question Time. I expressed the view that I was disappointed that he felt the political parties seemed to have no real concern about the state of the country and went on to emphasise that most members of parliament, from whatever political party, genuinely want to make our country a better place in which to live. I said their differences occur not because of a lack of commitment to this objective but because they have differing views about what is important for our country and how it should be achieved. When we have people in the community who, after visiting this place, come away from it with a view that members of parliament have ceased to put the future of their country at the top of their agenda, we need to really look at the perception that the community is getting from its observations of how our Parliament operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament is at the centre of our democracy, and if the esteem in which this place is held is in any way diminished, that in effect is a threat to our democratic system and to our democratic processes. As the custodians of the traditions of this Parliament we, as today's members, have a responsibility not just to this Parliament but to the tradition and history of our country to ensure that this place operates efficiently and smoothly and, most importantly, that it maintains the respect and the admiration of the people of Australia. It needs to be seen as an appropriate centrepiece of our democracy, and we have a responsibility to ensure that our procedures reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the Leader of the House and, indeed, a former Leader of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), refer to the predominant place that legislation plays in the procedures of this House. That is, of course, appropriate. Our legislative crush in part occurs because of the fact that so many Bills are brought in in such short time and there is inadequate scrutiny of what they contain. When the guillotine is applied&mdash;over the last two years, half of the legislation which went through this Parliament was subject to the guillotine&mdash;it is inevitable that there will be errors in legislation, that things will go through that neither side of the House would wish to have if they had had the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation properly. Therefore, we double the crush. These Bills have to come back in again to fix up the mistakes that were made the last time round. I do not think any of that helps the proceedings of the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to see three Ministers in the chamber at present. I think that must be something of a record. I would like to endorse the comments of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). It is regrettable that for most debates there are no Ministers in the chamber any more; Parliamentary Secretaries are left to carry legislation and to respond to the debate that occurs. I can understand that a Parliamentary Secretary is perfectly capable of reading the speech that some bureaucrat has written in relation to the presentation of a Bill, but I would have thought that Ministers who are carrying this legislation have the responsibility to be here to respond to the legitimate points that are raised by both sides during the debate. It is regrettable that the Ministers spend so little time in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that we have Standing Orders that we deliberately, by mutual agreement, infringe every day without anyone taking any notice. We deliberately overlook certain standing orders, obviously with good intent. By failing to enforce a standing order, we do damage to the whole of the Standing Orders. Where we have a standing order that we all have no intention of ever abiding by, we should get rid of it altogether, rather than having a gentlemen's agreement that, for some reason or other, we will overlook that standing order at particular times during the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and this is the most important point that I want to make and to emphasise yet again, no matter what we do with the Standing Orders, the fact is that this Parliament is made up of members; this Parliament is made up of people. Part of the trouble that we have with this Parliament is that members of parliament behave just like people; in other words, they all have their failings, they all have their idiosyncrasies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A critical element of the way in which members of the public perceive this Parliament is what they see on television. Sadly, all they see on television these days is Question Time. Question Time is by no means a typical example of an average hour in the life of a member of parliament. Those people sitting in the gallery at the moment would have a totally different impression of what goes on in parliament from those who sit in here in Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the leaders of this Parliament have a special responsibility to ensure that the decorum and the traditions of this place are respected, so do all honourable members. We must all accept our share of the responsibility for the public perception that this Parliament does not behave as well as it should. The Standing Orders of themselves do not make this Parliament. The personalities and the people do. We all have a responsibility to ensure that, no matter what Standing Orders are put in place, they are enforced and we all respect those Standing Orders and do what we can to make this place function more effectively. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I think that the televising of this Parliament ought to have awaited the implementation of a pay TV type of operation and something like C-SPAN which gives people an opportunity to see the totality of what takes place in a legislature by having a virtually permanent broadcast under some set of arrangements. Only then will people get an appropriate appreciation of what takes place in here and only then can the Question Time process be placed in its proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many good suggestions have been made, not least of which was the suggestion that we ought to look again at what is being proposed by the Procedure Committee. We will attempt to do that and respond to the various reports that have been brought down during the life of this Parliament before this Parliament rises. I am not a devotee of the election timetable called by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). As far as I can see, he has spent most of this year calling an election within weeks. As far as I am concerned, this Parliament has another 16 or 17 sitting days this year and, to all intents and purposes, probably the same amount of time in the course of next year. I have certainly been given no indication to believe that anything other than that is operative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament has a life until 8 May next year. I do not see any particular reason, from anything that I have been told, to assume that that life will not be lived. Of course, that is not a matter that is in my hands. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when questioned from time to time as this character wanders around the place crying wolf, has made the obviously sensible point that the calling of an election is up to the Government. He has also made the point that he sees no reason why the Parliament should not proceed to have its full value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with the view of the honourable member for Moncrieff that the Government has lost its appetite for reform. Part of the problem that we confront now is not that we have lost our appetite&mdash;we have not; we are an extraordinarily active government as far as legislation is concerned&mdash;but that our Standing Orders, which we are debating today, combined with our legislative program, have produced a bottleneck, fundamentally. There is no sense walking around that. That is exactly what has happened. We want to change the hours of sitting; we want to introduce a guaranteed position for private members; and we want this to be an enormously active government in legislative terms. The combination of the two has produced this bottleneck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are sitting the same number of days, on average&mdash;certainly the same number of hours, given the different hours that we permit&mdash;as have been set previously. We are no more than one or two days over or under the sorts of averages that existed prior to our period in office. I have an interest in parliament and am also a Minister. As Leader of the House, a few hours are added to the day when parliament is sitting. Basically, Ministers work 15 or 16 hours a day: that is all there is to it. There is no sense in our grizzling about it because we are all volunteers for this process. The hours that honourable members work are not dissimilar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no incentive for Ministers to attempt to make the Parliament sit more than it sits at present. When one actually looks at the periods when we sit, one sees that we have a fairly full year. Admittedly, we have been sitting for two weeks on and two weeks off and then we have gaps before we come back to consider matters that have been brought over from the Senate. But, at the end of the day, we effectively sit from around mid-February to mid-June and then from around mid-August to the end of December. That is basically what we do. We cover a very lengthy period indeed. No other parliament necessarily does a great deal better than us in terms of the length of time when we are more or less on parliamentary call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Question Time has been raised. Those opposite sometimes forget that we put forward to the Opposition&mdash;not under this Prime Minister but his predecessor&mdash;what was the product of a considerable amount of deliberation on our side of the House as to how Question Time should operate. The proposal that was put forward was that we ought to create a situation not dissimilar to that which applies in the British Parliament, although not going down the road of the British Parliament in requiring notice of questions&mdash;they would still be questions without notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put forward a proposition to the Opposition which was for a Question Time which enabled scrutiny of individual Ministers. Only a proportion of the Ministers would be available on a daily basis and the Prime Minister would be available once a week. There would be an opportunity to question those Ministers over that time. This proposition was rejected for reasons that are entirely a matter for those opposite. One thing that we will not be doing</PARA>
<PARA>is altering Question Time without the agreement of the Opposition. In our view, that would be untoward: we would not make those substantial radical changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a great shame that the Opposition did not agree to our proposition. What we have is a situation&mdash;it is not unique to this Government&mdash;where 80 per cent of Ministers scarcely field a question. Of those 80 per cent of Ministers who scarcely field a question, it is pretty clear-cut that they have had a discussion with an honourable member on this side of the House in an attempt to get something up for presentation in order to get a point across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recollect&mdash;I have had experience as an Opposition member&mdash;that when we were in opposition, one day in three was reserved for the average back bench member of parliament to get up and ask questions. We would see the entirety of the Opposition side rise on that one day in three. This was done for training purposes. Basically, it is true to say that the back bench, on both sides of the House, has lost the capacity to function in parliament. The honourable member for Moncrieff has not&mdash;she has been around long enough not to have lost it&mdash;but the bulk of her back bench has. That is seen in Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this day&mdash;not including today's questions&mdash;78 questions have been asked by the Opposition in this Budget session. Seventy of those questions have been asked by members of the Opposition front bench and only eight by backbenchers. Of those 70 questions, 50 have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith). If one includes the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), 59 of the 70 question have been asked by the four Opposition leaders. Only eight Opposition frontbenchers have asked questions. That has to be just about the laziest front bench on record in terms of performance in this place. Only eight shadow Ministers have got questions together in the Budget session to date and it is almost over. I am sure there are sound reasons in terms of Opposition tactics as to why this should have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a grizzle to the Government about Question Time. I may be corrected on this, but in the life of this Parliament I have never seen a backbenchers' question day. I have seen a period in which the Opposition front bench has limited itself in its questioning, and perhaps two or three times in the life of this Parliament, I have seen Opposition backbenchers rise to ask questions after about four or five questions from the Opposition front bench. Before pots call kettles black, the Opposition might like to review with its back bench members their opportunities for asking questions. As we can see from the news coverage of Question Time, while we may feel that we slay each other for an hour, only about 30 seconds worth of that slaying hits the news every night. </PARA>

If we were to make more ministerial statements in this place, our Senate managers of business would have heart attacks&mdash;for the simple reason that the Senate has got into the absurd position that, every time a Minister in this House makes a statement, a statement must be made in the Senate. That is ludicrous. It is a ridiculous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that point is worth considering when honourable members speak to their colleagues in the Senate. There are enough Ministers in the Senate available to make statements. When honourable senators debate statements, they do not half make a meal of it! They say, `That is Government business; therefore we will have it for the whole damn day'. So the Minister makes a statement in this place. A bit of commonsense applies on the part of the Opposition in this place. The Opposition insists on getting its frontbencher up to speak and perhaps one or two other back bench members who have an interest in the matter. It does not go touting for business; it is reasonable enough to find two or three members interested in the matter and leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the case in the Senate. In that chamber everybody gets his or her 20 minutes worth, and that is the end of Government Business. Opposition senators look at Government Ministers at the end of the day and say, `Ha, ha; we fooled you lot. We dealt with no legislation at all today; we debated your silly statement'&mdash;and it is a statement made by somebody in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means, I am afraid, is that we do not make ministerial statements. That is it. We are not going to put our Senate Ministers through that process. This is a new thing. When I was Minister for Defence I used to make two statements to parliament each year. Defence Ministers do not do that any more. The right honourable member for New England complained about that. Well, that is the reason. This is a new thing from the Senate. It has not been the case ever since Lionel Murphy was there&mdash;or one of the other characters who made it such an impossible House. The Senate has invented new ways of being impossible, and this is the latest way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that we on both sides of the House need to bear in mind. Obviously this motion has widespread support, and that is a good thing. I will be making an attempt some time in the remainder of this Parliament to respond to more of the Procedure Committee's reports on the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I put the question, I would like to make two points. Obviously, the Sessional Orders which will now become Standing Orders provide for a great deal of change to the way in which the House will work. I point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) that we do send petitions off to Ministers. They do not just end up in a black hole. All petitions presented to the House are forwarded to the relevant Ministers. In fact, the provision in the Sessional Orders that allows Ministers to make a response was put forward by me when I was a member of the Procedure Committee to give us a mechanism for getting a response, if necessary, into the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think two matters stand out concerning these Sessional Orders that are very important to the way the House will operate: the putting in concrete of a committee system and private members' business on Thursday mornings. I think the new committee system in the House of Representatives will stand this House in good stead for a long while. It is a way of bringing all members of the legislature into the policy making framework, because committees have gone past the old concept of considering just administration and not policy. Governments both react to and adopt positions that committees put forward, and those positions do not necessarily come from one side or the other. That is a very useful mechanism by which the Parliament as a whole can have an input into the policy making system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue relates to private members' Thursdays. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) referred to the terrible old days when we would see a matter of General Business finally being brought on for debate three years after it was lodged, when it had absolutely no relevance at all. We now have a mechanism whereby honourable members have the opportunity to put forward timely and topical issues which are considered by the House and, in some instances, voted on. Certainly, we have a mechanism here every Thursday for honourable members to air matters which are of importance to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those two particular issues which are now enshrined in the Standing Orders put a lot of power back into the hands of backbenchers. Too often we hear the argument that Question Time is the main focus of how this place works. Any member knows that that is not a fact. It suits the fiction of some journalists, who make a living from doing that, to suggest that it is so. It suits the fiction of Oppositions, no matter who they are, to suggest that it is. But the simple fact of the matter is that there is a lot of very good work done in this place&mdash;in other parts of the parliamentary process where there is reason, where there is understanding and where backbenchers do have a significant say. I think that both sides of the House, in adopting these Sessional Orders, recognise that and will ensure that members of the back bench on both sides of the House can play a larger role than they might have been able to play if these Sessional Orders had not been adopted as Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 gives effect to a number of changes in the social security system. Before I discuss the major aspects of the Bill, let me first say that I am aware of criticism that has been levelled at this sort of Bill in the past where, apart from changes to a number of social security programs, a significant number of minor and technical amendments are also included. In relation to the latter amendments, I draw honourable members' attention to the fact that the explanatory memorandum to this Bill has a new format in which the schedules introducing so-called `minor and technical amendments' itemise each amendment. Honourable members may be aware that it has been past practice to insert technical amendments without any numbering; simply grouping them in schedules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the format in this Bill may become an approach adopted by other portfolios where a large number of minor and technical amendments are included in a Bill. Apart from providing the item numbers, the explanatory memorandum gives a detailed explanation of items considered to be of particular interest. This is in answer to criticism that too many technical, but important, changes are `buried' in the schedules. This approach has not added to the size of the Bill but, of course, has resulted in a longer explanatory memorandum. However, that is the price I believe we should be prepared to pay to ensure an adequate explanation of the changes is given. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the comments of the honourable member opposite.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now discuss some of the more important items in this Bill. The compensation provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 will be extended to cover carer pension. At the moment, partners of compensation recipients are already covered and it is logical to have the provisions apply to carers who themselves receive compensation payments. The provisions will also be extended to cover carer pensioners irrespective of for whom the care is being provided. Carers who receive a lump sum compensation payment will be treated in the same way as other pensioners who are subject to the compensation provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will clarify the nexus between entitlement to family allowance, to be called family payment from 1 January 1993, and child disability allowance and double orphan pension. Put simply, a person with a child who attracts child disability allowance or double orphan pension will not attract family payment for that child unless the income and assets tests for family payment are met. The amendments will, however, make it clear that neither child disability allowance nor double orphan pension is subject to any income or assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two amendments to the pharmaceutical allowance provisions. The first is a technical amendment to include pharmaceutical allowance as part of the rate calculators in the Social Security Act. The second is more important in that it will ensure that a social security recipient who is qualified for the allowance will not receive less than the full pharmaceutical allowance rate even if the application of the income or assets tests would otherwise reduce the rate to less than the full rate of allowance&mdash;but more than nil. This is consistent with the proposition that the allowance was introduced to compensate social security recipients in full following the initiative to remove access to pharmaceutical benefits scheme items free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social security system is both complex and sophisticated in that it tries to target assistance to those most in need. Part of the running of a system which helps millions of Australians involves the extensive use of computers. The Bill will ensure that decisions which might look like `automatic' decisions made by force of law, that is, where there is no discretion involved, and put into effect by a computer&mdash;for example, to cancel a payment&mdash;will still be subject to the full review rights embodied in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act at present provides that Newstart allowance, Job Search allowance and sickness allowance are not payable to a person if the person has not given the Secretary to the Department of Social Security his or her tax file number. The Social Security Act is amended in this Bill to enable the Secretary to request a tax file number as a condition of qualification from claimants of those payments I have mentioned. There is nothing untoward about this amendment. Similar provisions already exist for other payments but I mention this change as I am conscious of the sensitivities involved in tax file number matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with my firmly held view that personal information provided to the Department should be protected to the greatest extent possible, this Bill introduces amendments which will make it an offence for any person, including an officer of the Department, to access client records unlawfully, for example to `browse' paper files without authority, and a further offence to disclose or deal with information which has been accessed unlawfully. Browsing of computer records is already an offence under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special benefit is a discretionary hardship payment and payment is usually limited only to persons in Australia. This Bill will enable payment overseas where there are exceptional circumstances but only for a period of up to 13 weeks. This discretion will cater for very unusual situations, like having to visit a seriously ill relative, but limit overall the amount of payment available to a person outside Australia. I emphasise that payment overseas is to occur only in a very few exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this Bill also includes, by way of a schedule, the international social security agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and Australia. The agreement is expected to come into force on 1 January 1993. It is another agreement to add to our growing list of such agreements with other countries which protect social security payments for persons who have had residence or made contributions in either country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the value of Australian Defence Force reservists, the Social Security Act currently allows reservists in training camps to qualify for Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance if those camps are inside Australia. The Bill will extend this concession to include reservists attending a training camp overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further concession to recipients of Job Search allowance and sickness allowance who are under 18 years old will be to exempt child maintenance payments to their parents from the parental income test. This is an acknowledgment that child maintenance is directed at assisting children and only maintenance paid to a recipient's parents which is not for children should be counted under the parental income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for limited relaxation of the sickness allowance rules. These will include provisions which allow for a discretion to backdate payment for up to four weeks following failure to lodge a medical certificate because of the person's medical condition or where there may have been delay in processing a medical certificate, to allow for payments, in certain circumstances, to 15 year olds undertaking a rehabilitation program and to allow for payment where a person might be in full time education as part of a rehabilitation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas covered by the Bill include the repeal of certain superfluous offence provisions and to limit to three months the period within which to lodge a claim for payment when a person's payment is cancelled overseas, without the need to return to Australia.

<PARA>The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 amends the Banking Act 1959, the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 and the Reserve Bank Act 1959 for several purposes, mainly to give effect to policy measures previously announced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to put into effect the Government's policy to liberalise foreign bank entry, which was announced in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. The amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to permit the issue of banking authorities to foreign owned banks, where the Reserve Bank is satisfied that the bank and its home supervisor are of sufficient standing, and where the bank agrees to comply with Reserve Bank prudential supervision arrangements. This measure is in line with the Government's commitment to opening up the economy. It will bring benefits of competition in the domestic banking system and improve its international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as wholesale banks in the form of a branch. Under the current supervisory arrangements, foreign banks are required to be incorporated locally as subsidiaries of the parent bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A branch of a foreign bank cannot be subject to the same degree of prudential supervision and depositor protection as can be applied to a subsidiary. The Government places great importance on protecting the interests of depositors via the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. For this reason, the Government has decided to confine foreign bank branches to wholesale banking. If a foreign bank wishes to conduct retail banking in Australia, it must continue to be incorporated locally as a subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that this amendment should bring competitive gains and efficiencies, greater flexibility in the provision of finance, and cost advantages to Australian clients. It should also bring advantages to banks and improve the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to make it clear that depositors with foreign bank branches are not subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act. The Bill also provides that foreign bank branches will be required to disclose that they are not subject to the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act. In addition, if foreign banks do not comply with conditions of their banking authorities, or requirements of the legislation, their banking authorities may be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to complement New South Wales legislation which will enable the State Bank of New South Wales to apply for a banking authority under the Banking Act. The Government has agreed to a request from the New South Wales Government that the State refer its banking powers in this regard to the Commonwealth. The State Bank of New South Wales has indicated that it intends to apply for an authority as soon as the New South Wales legislation is enacted. As an authorised bank under the Banking Act, it will be on the same footing as other authorised banks and subject to the supervisory requirements of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, the Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to make several minor amendments with respect to unclaimed moneys in bank accounts, and to revoke the banking authority of the Australian Resources Development Bank. The few remaining deposit liabilities of the ARDB will be transferred to the National Australia Bank Ltd, which currently owns all the shares in the ARDB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixth, part 3 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 32 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to streamline the process of declaring dividends, by enabling the board of the Commonwealth Bank to declare dividends without seeking shareholder approval at a general meeting. This is consistent with the practice of other major banks. The Treasurer will continue to approve the amount of the Commonwealth Bank's dividend payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, part 4 of the Bill amends the Reserve Bank Act 1959 to provide for the creation of a second deputy governor position in the Reserve Bank. This will assist the Reserve Bank's prudential supervision of the banking system and is consistent with a recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry into banking. The second deputy governor will also participate in the management of the Reserve Bank and will be a member of the Reserve Bank board. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

If he realised what he was doing to the morale of the people working in those companies and the likely effect it will have on sales of the automotive car industry I think he would cease this very quickly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House an indication of the sorts of comments he has made. In 1989, the Prime Minister denounced the `insidious cancer of protectionism'. In 1990, he said that `protectionism and tariff protection have been a poison on Australian manufacturing'. Last year he declared that the tariff wall `has done so much to damage the nation's prospects'. He insisted that Australia's current problems were not due to tariff cuts but to lazy management.

<PARA>We can only assume from that comment that the other industries will include the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. I wish to address several other matters tonight in relation to Australian industry, both manufacturing and agricultural. Numerous other countries in our region&mdash;indeed, I believe all our major trading partners&mdash;have very strong anti-dumping and quality control regimes in place. There can be no such thing as a level playing field in this country when our archaic anti-dumping and quality control laws are providing no assistance whatsoever to Australian producers, whether they be in manufacturing or agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, the aim of GATT is to promote international trade. To ensure fair trade, the agreement makes special provision to allow member countries to take action against products which are dumped or subsidised. Dumping is when the imported product sells for less in Australia than its normal price in the country of origin. Products are liable to countervailing duties if a subsidy is paid by the foreign government on exports or production and the price is less than the domestic price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year Australia passed legislation along the lines of that in place in the US to enable material damage to truly vertically integrated horticultural and agricultural producers to be taken into account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Material damage is probably the most contentious issue because it seems to mean different things to different countries. According to the Anti-Dumping Authority, damage has to be proven and it has to be substantial. The US considers that even a one per cent loss of market is enough for it. Australia recently joined other countries such as those in the EC, the US and Canada, with a five-year sunset clause on duties. An Australian Senate committee found that trying to make the importer prove the product was not dumped would be in breach of Australia's obligations under article 16(6a) of the Anti-Dumping Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the US the petitioner is not required to prove information which is not reasonably available and he or she must just satisfy the Department of Commerce that he or she has properly alleged `sufficient evidence of injury'. In Australia, however, our pig producers, for example, cannot file a complaint until they fill in the entire form which requires information from processors. But our processors will not cooperate because they are the ones who are importing the pig meat from Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition plans to speed up decision making processes for anti-dumping and countervailing duties and ensure that the material injury test is fair and does not mean that the industry has to be virtually decimated before remedial action is recognised as warranted. The irony of all this is that the Government has spent $9m promoting the `Buy Australian' campaign&mdash;and I support it on that&mdash;but has neglected to address the vital area of reducing costs. The coalition's Fightback package will bring down these costs and farmers will save $1,025m just from the abolition of taxes; and the food industry, including canners, will save $1,336m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to my next point which concerns the question of labelling food standards. It was only recently that the States agreed to a unified national process for setting standards for food available for sale in Australia. The National Food Standards Council, comprising Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers, now considers recommendations from the National Food Authority and decides, on a majority vote, whether to adopt them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the States agreed that orange juice and other fruit juice products which contained any imported fruit juice had to be labelled, either with the specific country of origin or with a statement to the effect that part or all of the ingredients were imported. The States also agreed that imported unpackaged fish, fruit, vegetables and nuts be labelled at the point of sale with the country of origin or with a statement that the goods were imported. The juice regulations were due to start no later than 1 January 1992 and the other products from 28 February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority now says that it has uniform standards for food in Australia. However, the problem is that the States are not enforcing or insisting that food coming into the country must reach the same standards. This is no better evidenced that in an example often quoted by my colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), whereby the lead content in Australian-produced food has decreased because Australians have insisted that the cans be welded not soldered. The crazy thing about this is that while Australian manufacturers must ensure that they comply with this code, importers do not. Welding is far more expensive than soldering and the impact of this cost disadvantage is blatantly obvious. If there was a majority decision of State and Territory governments to refuse to accept these cans AQIS could then be expected to inspect and reject these imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is a matter of national disgrace that the States and the Territories have not got their act together, and I urge them to do so as a matter of great urgency. The other ludicrous part is that, until the recent announcement by the responsible Minister, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service had only seven inspectors of imported food and they inspected only 17 items. If the States seek more inspection, AQIS will happily increase its staff because it charges the importers 100 per cent of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Minister's new arrangements in relation to tougher control on food imports, and particularly tighter inspection on imported foods at the point of entry into Australia. I will be keeping a careful eye on this matter because, as the Minister puts it, `the non-compliance of any imported food product in such areas as truth in labelling, additives, product composition, residue levels and general cleanliness is clearly not acceptable to the Australian community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is serious about ensuring that foreign products meet the Australian food standard code, and I hope this view is shared by the Government. I am pleased that the head of the imported food program in AQIS, Mr Steve Bailey, has been quoted as saying that if importers did not meet Australian standards their goods would be denied access to Australian markets and they would risk the expense of bringing their goods to Australia only to be refused entry and having to pay costly inspection fees. It is important to note that these rules are no more onerous than those applying to Australian food producers. Indeed, why should that not be the situation? It is no different from what is applying to our producers now. But it has been a long time coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sound a note of caution that Australian food producers are also importers of key ingredients and it is essential that, for the system to work, it must not become bogged down in bureaucracy but rather be able to get on with achieving what needs to be achieved in the most efficient and cost effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australians have any doubt about the impact of imported foods in this country, they should be aware that in the last 12 months to 30 June 1992 we imported foodstuffs and skins worth $2.36 billion. This was marginally up on last year. Approximately $1.1 billion of this was in food. For vegetable and food imports during the year there was an increase of $86m from $382.6m to $469.1m. The value of live animals fell by $73m and there was a small increase in tea, coffee, cocoa and spice imports during that period. Feeding stuffs for animals increased from $65.2m to $90m, and meat and meat preparations rose $6m to $42.5m. Dairy products and birds' eggs rose $9m to $135m, and fish imports were up nearly $30m to $474.5m. Cereal and cereal preparations increased marginally by $2m up to $112m, while sugars, sugar preparations and honey fell $2m to $59m. In the area of fruit and vegetables, the largest item was orange juice, which was up from $9m to $23m. Apple juice accounted for $13m, which was up from $5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of great concern to my electorate, and undoubtedly many others throughout the country, was the dramatic increase in prepared or preserved vegetables, which at $39m is up almost $1m on last year. As a matter of interest, these vegetables came from 45 countries, with the largest number being from New Zealand at $12.3m, Spain at $7.8m, Canada at $4.7m, Thailand at $3.4m, Greece at $2.3m, Italy at $1.9m and China at $1.6m. The other great concern to me is that frozen vegetables were up $7m on last year to $24m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some of the matters I have raised tonight in relation to point of entry inspection could give some&mdash;and I repeat `some'&mdash;comfort to farmers in my region, I am afraid the same cannot be said for my manufacturers. Although I understand there are some legislative requirements in relation to imported manufactured products, it is my view that point of entry inspections in relation to food should take place, as has been proposed by the Minister. Evidence I have been given by my own manufacturers is that our trading partners, including Japan, have very rigorous point of entry inspection for our manufactured products, and at the mildest this has been described to me as exhaustive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are really going to assist manufacturers in this country, I believe that we must urgently impose quality controls similar to those of our trading partners. I intend writing to major organisations within Australia requesting that they collect anecdotal evidence of the matters that have been raised with me by the manufacturers in my electorate so that we can ascertain the full extent of the problem and address it accordingly. I can see absolutely no reason why the definition of manufactured product should not be extended to such things as clothing and footwear. Why, for example, should strict quality control be imposed on our manufacturers of clothing and footwear when similar quality controls are not imposed on low taxed producers in other parts of world, especially Asia, which also have low labour costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, if our Australian producers do not make quality products, they are readily accountable within the marketplace and are easily targeted by consumer watchdog organisations. The same does not apply to imported clothing and footwear, and this is especially so for what I would describe loosely as dumped clothing and footwear that might not be continually supplied and may only be a once-off shipment. The difficulty is that a constant supply of even once-off imports dramatically impacts on the competitive position of our own Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe enough is enough. If we are really going to be serious about our Australian manufacturers, we must allow our own producers to compete both internally and externally without the burden of dumped poor quality goods. It is inexcusable that we do not apply the same standards on imported goods as are applied to our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is that this is not a question of false protection; this is not a question of tariffs. There is bipartisan support in this country about tariffs, or least there was until about two months ago, and I have already raised that issue. I have said before that after the next election the comments made by the Prime Minister will haunt everyone who is foolish enough to believe what he said prior to the Wills by-election and since then. But we are not talking about that. I am talking about our Australian manufacturers and food producers who, quite frankly, in my view are getting a pretty raw deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see absolutely no reason why we should not impose on imported products the very same strict quality controls as we are imposing on our producers. To me it seems a matter of commonsense. Why should they be at some great disadvantage compared with imported products when it comes to quality control?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has heard me tell this story about the day of the great Aussie breakfast outside Parliament House just before Christmas. The honourable member for Hinkler was there; I think the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was there as well. I walked down and saw this box of the most motley looking apricots&mdash;I think that is what they were. I said to one of these fruit fellows, who I think was from up along the Murray River, `What are they?', and he told me. I said, `Where are they from?'. He said, `They are imported'. I said, `How did they get into the country?'. He said, `Well, they got in easily enough, but&mdash;guess what?&mdash;there was some mix-up with faxes and twice as much came in as was ordered. So they sent it back to the wharf'. Guess what happened then, Mr Deputy Speaker? There was some quality inspection and, because the food was substandard, it was not allowed out!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we really need to wake up to ourselves, because we are not giving any credibility to our own manufacturers by having this public debate raging right across the country about something for which there is bipartisan support, and I am talking about tariffs. Let us get on with giving our manufacturers and our agricultural producers some real hope that we are going to start cutting out some of these ludicrous anti-competitive positions that they find themselves in. </PARA>

To me it is totally unacceptable that, when our exporters are going into other countries, they are being subjected to quality controls that are not imposed on imports coming into this country at the point of sale or elsewhere. That is the single most important thing that we can do for the manufacturers in this country. </PARA>

The real difficulty that the honourable member for Ballarat has is trying to justify the unjustifiable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like initially to outline the changes. There are a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act, which basically cover about seven schedules. The first one is to provide a free rate of duty for aquarium aerators, transmission shafts and cranks for outboard motors and master recording blanks. The second change provides a free rate of duty for instructional books for certain games. Schedule 3 is operative from 7 May 1992 and reduces the customs duty on aviation gasoline by 1c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 is operative from 1 July 1992 and contains changes to schedules 3 and 5 to the principal Act to put in place government initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers. This schedule also contains the extension of quota restrictions on certain types of cheese. Administrative changes have been made to the duty-free importation of pick-ups and utilities which are 30 or more years of age and components for passenger motor vehicles. In schedule 4, changes will provide new duty-free concessions to allow processors to import the latest overseas technology for use in these industries. Schedule 5, which is operative from 19 August 1992, increases the duty on certain tobacco products by $5 per kilogram. As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech, the duty on aviation gasoline is further reduced by 1.1c per litre. In March last year the Government announced that quota arrangements for textile, clothing and footwear goods will be abolished from 1 March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 contains a series of amendments to give effect to this policy. Goods previously subject to quota will be subject to ad valorem rates of duty. Concessional treatment of industrial crafts will also be abolished from 1 March next year. Schedule 6, which is operative from 1 July 1993, redefines the rate of duty applicable to certain spiritous liquors of chapter 22 from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province. The customs component of duty on imported beer is to be removed in schedule 8 to this Bill. In future, imported beer will attract the same rate of duty as does locally brewed beer. Other changes contained in this Bill are of an administrative nature and in the main combine those national subheadings where the same rate of duty applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some of the amendments are small, they cover a very  broad range in the customs and excise area. This Bill will have a massive effect on the economy of this country because it covers the TCF industries as well as the manufacturing and automobile industries, on which the honourable member for Ballarat has commented. The issues of tariffs and protection have been vocalised over the last few months. It has a massive impact in my area particularly, as it is an agricultural area. At this stage of the debate I acknowledge in the gallery a shire councillor from Gooburrum Shire in Bundaberg, Councillor Sel Lutz, and Mrs Jo Crocker from the Bundaberg Tourist and Development Board. It is good to see here two people from Bundaberg who have a great interest in the development of our city and our district, particularly in our agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months there has been impassioned debate in the House on tariffs and, certainly in my area, sugar. I want to make a point which I have made once in the House but would like to restate as the honourable member for Ballarat covered some related areas. In an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Extra</EMPHASIS> on 1 October, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . somebody starts dumping on the Australian market&mdash;the Government I think requires something like&mdash;the dumped product has something like 20 per cent of the market before they do anything.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite inaccurate. In fact, it is absolutely silly. I am surprised that the man who would be Treasurer if he could simply does not understand dumping. As a consequence, I sent him a well-printed schedule from the Customs Service so he could apprise himself of the facts. I was pleased to see that at least the honourable member for Ballarat has some understanding of dumping provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has one of the fastest and most effective anti-dumping measures in the world. It takes 25 days for a case to be determined and a further 100 days for Customs to bring in a decision; that is 125 days. After that, it takes a further 120 days for the Anti-Dumping Authority to finally make a recommendation, but countervailing measures are able to be applied after the 125 days. Along with New Zealand's, these are the fastest anti-dumping laws in the world. Anti-dumping laws are GATT related. The length of our procedures is not 10 or 20 but dozens of days shorter than those of the EC and the United States. If we are to have any comparisons, we should make them with the EC and the United States. We do have effective anti-dumping laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the issue of tariffs. The honourable member for Ballarat and some Opposition members, who are now starting to buckle a bit at the knees because they are under pressure from their own constituents, are trying to say that the Opposition has a similar policy to ours on tariffs. It does not. It is like chalk and cheese or like Geelong and the West Coast Eagles in the third quarter. In the TCF industries we have a tariff of 25 per cent; on cars, 15 per cent, which is an actual 36 per cent; on manufacturing, 5 per cent; and on the dairy industry, 10 per cent. The sugar inquiry will determine a recommendation that the Government will consider in regard to tariffs on sugar. At this point, as I have said on so many other occasions, I will not pre-empt the inquiry's recommendation, but there is a bit of pressure on the other side of the House, particularly on the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have had the privilege of doing on many occasions, I refer to table 4.1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. For those on the Opposition back bench who can read, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural and manufacturing assistance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is not `negligible', not `nearly', not `5 per cent'; it is `the elimination', and that means no tariffs whatsoever. So there is a massive difference between what the Opposition proposes and what the Government proposes. The Government has worked at sensible levels with the dairy industry, as we are working with the sugar industry and as we have just done with the wheat industry. It is about working with industry, not some hairy-chested, zero tariff, scorched-earth policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting thing in regard to information and understanding in this debate is that, to find further confusion on the part of the Opposition, one needs only to listen to what is said in the media. As I have said before in this House, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 24 September the shadow Treasurer made it clear that there would be no hope for the relaxation of the Opposition's zero tariff policy. He went on to say that the reason for this was the high cost of sugar in Australia. The fact is that we have the third cheapest domestic price of sugar in the world. It is not dear at all. I wish the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer would go up to Queensland, get some dirt on his shoes, speak to farmers and come to understand the facts of life in that regard. The Australian Cane Farmers Association newsletter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That attitude is held in a number of circles. Liberal parliamentarian Ian McLachlan, former NFF president, recently defended the Coalition Zero-Tariff policy, calling the sugar industry a `tired industry run by tired old men.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute and utter nonsense. The sugar industry is one of the best industries in this country, and the people who are running that industry have vision and commonsense. As a consequence of that, of course, the sugar industry understands that it has nowhere to go with the National Party in particular&mdash;nowhere to go at all. </PARA>

<PARA>The fact is the only front-end loaded help that canefarmers will get from the Nationals is a 15 per cent tax on their food and clothes, industrial disputation, a run of 7 per cent in inflation and utter chaos with regard to trade. I refer people to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program if they need to know what effect the Leader of the National Party would have on international trade or our standing in the international community. Even better is a declaration signed by Senator Bill O'Chee, the kid from Queensland; Don Beck, MLA; and two National Party candidates in the northern rivers region who say that they will `fight against the recommendations of the Industry Commission report into the sugar industry' that they are committed to supporting in Fightback, and also, of course, `oppose any additional cuts in the sugar tariff that are not accompanied by the implementation of measures that will reduce the costs of the sugar industry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could say this is the National Party's attempt to compare with the Monroe Doctrine, but the fact is that all it does is demonstrate that it cannot hold the line when it comes to its own constituency. I challenge the Leader of the National Party to stand up in front of canegrowers, hold up his Fightback package, hold up table 4.1, and say, `This is what we stand for'. If he does not, he should tell everyone down here in the press gallery that he does not support the Leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He cannot do both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest shonks of all time concerned the income levels that were provided by the National Farmers Federation for an analysis through the company Acil on the effects of Fightback. The interesting thing is, of course, that the net income levels given were between $55,500 and $71,000. There are not many farmers in Australia&mdash;and certainly not in my electorate&mdash;who are earning anywhere near that money. They are earning nowhere near it. Certainly a large number of farmers have a large debt structure, with interest and redemption to be paid. To use an analysis of Fightback based on that is a total joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a joke particularly as the Leader of the National Party and other people continually recognise the fact that we have a rural crisis. I was criticised in March 1990 when I said that we did not have a rural crisis in Australia, but members of the National Party now want to indicate that the average income we should do an analysis on for the effects of Fightback is between $55,500 and $71,000 net. Members of the National Party cannot have it both ways any more than they can say they support table 4.1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, which means the elimination of all tariff and bounty assistance to both manufacturing and agriculture, and then come up to Queensland and say negligible tariffs, 5 per cent tariffs, not merely tariffs or whatever else comes to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to comments about imported foods, the only way we will reduce imported foods is by aggressively marketing and promoting Australian products&mdash;that is happening&mdash;and by ensuring that we tighten up wherever we can with regard to health standards. That also is happening. One of the biggest challenges we have had is to get the agreement of all States on many of the structures we need to improve this mechanism, and the Government is doing that. The reason we require the cooperation of the States is the Constitution, the laws in this country that were formed in 1901. We now have compulsory labelling of unpackaged food, fish, nuts and the like and, as a consequence, we can aggressively market the Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it also needs to be recognised that the majority of Australian farm product has to be sold overseas. No ship will take a shipment of beef, wheat, wool or sugar to the United States and come back empty. That is not commercial commonsense and the shipping company would go broke. When a ship unloads in America, it brings back automobiles, oranges, computers or something else. That is called bilateral trade. No country will buy products off us unless we buy off them. It is unfortunate that in this debate there have been a lot of often clouded attitudes expressed, mainly by nervous nellies on the Opposition side who are not prepared to tell farmers the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia exports $6.3 billion&mdash;and it is growing at 8 per cent per annum&mdash;of processed and semi-processed food product to the Asia-Pacific Basin, and we import $2 1/4 billion. This means we have a surplus of over $4 billion in our favour. So those in the National Party in Queensland and those in the League of Rights who want to ban that food product coming in would have to then tell those Australian farmers who export the $6.3 billion that they would have no market. We will solve this problem through the GATT round, through bilateral trade and through commonsense, not by irrational, 1920 attitudes that have been so rampant in the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party commented about the Cattlemen's Union in Queensland moving a vote of no-confidence in me. I would be disappointed if it moved a vote of confidence in me because we have in the bush at the moment an industrial relations campaign that is being run by Troubleshooters, out of the H.R. Nicholls Society. The reason the union moved a vote of no confidence in me, following the UGA doing the same and the hillbillies in the south Queensland grain growers, is that I have named in this House instances where companies, contractors and individuals have robbed workers of money in the shearing industry and I have said continuously I will continue to name those people who rob workers of the money they are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party does not like it because he wants to destroy award conditions.

It would have been supporting the corrupt magistrate that sent the 13 leaders of those shearers to gaol. I am pleased to say that the lackeys who do his work in the Cattlemen's Union in Queensland and the UGA have demonstrated that they do not support the law of the land, because to breach the industrial award of the land is to break the law.

The fact is they are doing the work for the National Party out there and it is not getting them anywhere. It never has, and it never will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;On behalf of the Government I wish to sum up the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). I will not delay the House for long. I thank the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) once more for his enlightening contribution. My good friend the honourable member for Hinkler always touches the raw nerve of the National Party of Australia. I am sure that he will continue to be the honourable member for Hinkler for many terms. I do not think he is particularly worried by the motions of no-confidence in him moved by National Party organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I want to concentrate on one contribution in specific terms&mdash;that is, a number of comments made by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) as the shadow Minister for industry. He mentioned the continuation of the quotas for cheese. He said that the industry would be better off lodging a countervailing case under the anti-dumping provisions that we have, but he did not think the industry was prepared to do that. There have been meetings between the industry and Customs, starting in February this year. The industry is preparing an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker also said that our anti-dumping processes are too slow and that the Opposition's proposals are better. I have already in this House sunk the Opposition's anti-dumping proposals. The Opposition's proposal for 65 days would not allow enough time to gather data, it would not allow enough time for a rough analysis and, therefore, no finding would result. We guarantee a preliminary finding in 125 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out that what those opposite say can be done in 65 days is absolute nonsense. Apart from being inconsistent with GATT, it is a total fraud. Our processes are now quicker at the preliminary finding stage, which is the most crucial part of anti-dumping mechanisms. We are quicker than the United States, which allows 160 days to get to preliminary finding; Canada, which allows 141 days; and the EC, which allows a massive 270 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other contributions were made tonight. As this is a tariff Bill, one area we should all be conscious of is the car tariff that is placed on imports. Recently, when I led a construction mission to South East Asia&mdash;to Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand&mdash;it was pleasing to see, once more, that Australia is exporting Holdens into Thailand. Some 3,000 Holden Calais a year are now exported to Thailand. Why? Because there is a tariff and an export credit system. They export them as CKD packs. This means that Australia is getting back into markets that it lost. It could not do that under the Opposition's policy of zero tariffs because there is no export credit if there is a zero tariff. Therefore, those export industries would be lost. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the patience of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate the Opposition's support for the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill 1992. I will be supported in committee by the shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), who will move an amendment which has the agreement of the Government. That amendment will make it absolutely certain that nothing in the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 can be taken to prevent the sale or disposal of a pipeline&mdash;that is, the subsequent privatisation of the Pipeline Authority or part thereof.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core feature of the Bill is to set up a subsidiary of the Pipeline Authority to operate the Authority's commercial sectors. This includes the Oberon and Canberra laterals which run off the main 1,300 kilometre Moomba to Sydney major gas pipeline. A cynic could well ask why one would want to pipe gas or hot air to Canberra, given that there are not one but two parliaments in Canberra. There is this Parliament&mdash;the one south of the Lake, which is the Parliament of the whole of Australia&mdash;and there is the other parliament north of the Lake, the parliamentary playhouse, which is the ACT Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assembly, too, is interested in this Bill because it will allow and provide for the operations of the Pipeline Authority in respect of Canberra and Oberon to be transferred to a subsidiary. It also applies to the proposed Riverina pipeline extension, currently being built through to Griffith. I know that the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) strongly supports the extension to Griffith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of natural gas to country areas over the years has been a tremendous boost to decentralisation. Many key provincial centres are now connected to the pipeline, including Orange, Lithgow, Young, Wagga Wagga and Sydney. The pipeline has been a tremendous boost to the energy needs of decentralised industries in those centres and has resulted in direct and indirect employment. I include here the employment flowing from the quite large operational centre at Young in the electorate of the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). This operational centre includes both a compressor station and an operational centre. I know that a number of staff located in that area are interested in partaking of any subsequent privatisation arrangement involving the sale of shares to the public, should that be the nature of the privatisation process further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of natural gas as a form of energy and its taxation by government is a very complex policy area. This Parliament legislated last year for a form of RRT on Bass Strait gas. That legislation imposed a different form of taxation on both oil and gas from Bass Strait. That policy is still not finally settled in terms of who will actually end up paying for the $60m provided by the Federal Government to ease the transitional burden of the new taxation arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that this is a very complex policy area; it is a very complex taxation area. I make the further point that it has been said, quite correctly, that the cost could be absorbed from the Victorian Government take in respect of that parcel of gas and gas taxation so that the cost would not be passed on to the gas consumer in Victoria. This would still maintain the relative advantage of Victoria. I make the further point that there is a limit to how much the Federal Government can provide in respect of transitional measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of $60m is about the right limit. Therefore, those governments more directly involved, including the new  Victorian Government, those who operate the Bass Strait gas production, the various utilities involved and the consumers will have to address this question, and in the not too distant future. They will very carefully have to reach the right conclusion because the matter cannot drift on forevermore without some finalisation of the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add with regard to AGL and its operation, that the Moomba pipeline was the subject of a botched attempt at privatisation by fiat and by tearing up an existing commercial contract in a very savage way. The Liberal and National parties resolved to oppose that in very definite terms. Subsequently, the matter became the subject of considerable litigation. The Government lost that litigation, by and large, before the High Court of Australia; indeed, the Federal Government was ordered to pay costs to AGL. Finally, last month the Supreme Court denied the Commonwealth Government the right to appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a complex matter. The courts ruled in favour of AGL. I think the lesson for the Parliament and for the Government is that existing contracts cannot lightly be disposed of. Such contracts have been drawn up in good faith; they have been adopted and signed in good faith. Whilst Parliament has extraordinary powers, those powers have to be used very carefully indeed when it comes to dealing with existing contracts, be it in relation to the supply of gas along the Moomba pipeline or, indeed, the supply of gas from Bass Strait or elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that the legislation represents a belated step in the right direction by the Federal Government to provide for the creation of a subsidiary to control some of the operations of the Pipeline Authority. That step is welcomed, nevertheless, by the coalition which recognises that gas, in its various forms, including autogas, will play an increasing role in the energy equation of Australia under the Fightback package. There is no question about that. Further, the legislation will help facilitate a fair dinkum and subsequent privatisation of the pipeline operation when the coalition comes to power. This will not be done by fiat or by draconian legislative action, tearing up existing commercial contracts and applying, retrospectively, a penalty, but will be done by fair negotiation and resolution of the problems involved in regard to switching from the public sector to the private sector the key gas pipeline from Moomba and the supply of gas to a number of decentralised centres in New South Wales, the ACT and, as I mentioned, Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bruce will move the amendment which will ensure the protection of the right to privatise. Nothing in this legislation will restrict that. As I mentioned, the coalition supports the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill. I add only that, in one sense, this legislation is long overdue and represents a far better approach than that tried by the Government two years ago with its heavy-handed, autocratic and draconian approach which was to tear up longstanding agreements in a very unfair way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill is to provide a reform package for the Pipeline Authority to enable it to achieve a more commercially orientated approach to its operations. The Bill complements the Government's micro-economic reform objectives and is another element in the national gas strategy announced by the Minister for Resources (Mr  Griffiths) in November last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth in the natural gas industry over the last 20 years has led to its present position as the third primary source of energy after coal and petroleum. Gas is recognised as a versatile energy source with advantages over other fossil fuels. Its clean burning characteristics are an important attribute in light of the Government's adoption of an overall target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian gas industry is seen as being on the threshold of a new period of growth, not only as a major reliable supplier to the domestic energy market but as a major exporter of liquefied natural gas into the next century. Australia has captured a valuable share of the world liquefied natural gas trade. Exports from the North West Shelf project are forecast to grow to seven million tonnes per annum by 1995. At these levels, the export value of LNG, oil and condensate from the North West Shelf could approach $3 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was against this background of an expanding role for natural gas in the Australian economy that the Minister for Resources announced in this House last November the national gas strategy. That strategy has four key elements: the development of free and fair interstate trade in gas; removal of impediments to LNG exports; an appropriate regime for interstate gas pipeline development; and reform of public utilities, with particular emphasis on reform of the Pipeline Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry responses to the national gas strategy have been unanimous in supporting the Government's view that a truly national approach is needed to develop our national gas reserves. It is essential to free up markets to provide the incentive for future development of Australia's domestic and export gas industry. If we are to move towards an efficient development of natural gas markets and related infrastructure, including more competition in gas supply, it will be necessary to allow unrestricted interstate trade in natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent gas supply and demand study by the Australian Gas Association provides I think a timely warning of the costs involved if parochial attitudes and self-interest by the State and Territories prevent free and open interstate trade in gas. I am sure that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) would certainly agree with those sentiments. The AGA estimates that restricted interstate gas trade would, over the period to the year 2030, cost gas consumers up to $4 billion more in net present value terms. I think it is clearly time for the State and Territory governments to set aside their parochial interests so that the whole nation can reap the benefits of a free market in interstate trade for gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another plank in the national gas strategy was reform of government instrumentalities. The Government's direct role in natural gas operations is restricted largely to its ownership of the Pipeline Authority. The Authority owns and operates the pipeline system from Moomba in South Australia to Sydney and regional centres in New South Wales. The Government announced in late 1989 that it would develop a reform package for the Pipeline Authority as part of the Government's wider agenda for micro-economic reform. That reform, however, had to be postponed pending the investigation of the pipeline sale during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Government announced in the 1992 Budget that the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system has been reinstated to the program of asset sales, the sale is unlikely to be completed before the 1993-94 financial year, and of course this was recognised in the Budget statement. The Government believes that the reform of the Pipeline Authority is essential and should not be delayed further. These reforms include putting the Authority's commercially based operations into a government business enterprise style subsidiary. This will enable the return of the Pipeline Authority's assets to be optimised in the lead-up to the proposed sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central feature of the reform package is to provide for the creation of a subsidiary of the Pipeline Authority to undertake those operations of the Pipeline Authority that are based on a commercial rate of return. This will include the Canberra and Oberon laterals and the proposed Riverina pipeline extension to Griffith. While the subsidiary will operate as a commercial government business enterprise, the Pipeline Authority will continue to operate the Moomba to Sydney mainline and the laterals to Lithgow and Wagga Wagga on the cost recovery basis determined by the existing contracts between the Pipeline Authority and the Australian Gas Light Co. The Minister for Resources will determine the reporting requirements whereby strategic ministerial oversight, rather than day to day administrative approvals, will be exercised over the subsidiary, consistent with the guidelines for government business enterprise accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These guidelines emphasise ministerial approval of the enterprises overall corporate strategies, with enterprise boards responsible for development of those strategies and the handling of day to day management policies. This means that ministerial control over the Pipeline Authority subsidiary will be by ministerial oversight and approval of the Pipeline Authority and its subsidiary's strategic corporate plan, annual operating plans and financial targets. Subject to the passage of this Bill and completion of the necessary legal formalities, the Government envisages the early reorganisation of the Pipeline Authority. The legal separation of the Pipeline Authority's commercial and non-commercial operations will facilitate assessment of the subsidiary's performance against the criteria outlined in its corporate plan. It will provide the correct commercial incentives for the management of the subsidiary and ensure the financial and operating results of each organisation are separate and transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms in the proposed legislation have the potential to provide substantial benefits. They will allow the management of the Pipeline Authority and its subsidiary greater flexibility in operations on a range of issues that previously required ministerial approval, while retaining adequate accountability under the guidelines for government business enterprise operations. This will enable the Pipeline Authority's subsidiary to take advantage of a range of commercial opportunities that are emerging in Australia and overseas, including the provision of consultancy and pipeline transmission support services as a result of growing demand for natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about energy and resources, and indeed following on from the Leader of the National Party who has, in the past, said that he is a passionate believer in energy efficiency, I refer him to his own coalition's Fightback policy, particularly as it relates to LPG. As the Leader of the National Party would know, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposes to abolish the price advantage on LPG over petrol. This of course will threaten an expanding business which provides jobs, which encourages a more environmentally friendly fuel supply, and a business which reduces our dependency on oil imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been quoted many times before in this House, when the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was asked about the Fightback proposal as it related to LPG, he confirmed the adverse impact of the Opposition policy in relation to the LPG industry when he admitted in Adelaide on a radio program in April of 1992 that anyone converting to LPG under the Opposition would be indeed crazy. As I said, whilst we are talking about energy and resources, I would also like to refer the Leader of the National Party to his Party's policy in relation to uranium because, as he would be well aware, under Labor Party policy we would prohibit the establishment in Australia of nuclear power plants and all other stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, under his Party's proposals, Australia would have uranium enrichment plants and potentially, of course, nuclear power plants. This is a very important issue, particularly for those people who live in my electorate in Charters Towers because, as I understand it, the Leader of the National Party has made it quite clear that if he were to become Deputy Prime Minister of this country, then it would be his policy to ensure that the Ben Lomond uranium mine just outside Charters Towers would go ahead. This flies absolutely in the face of what the people in Charters Towers believe ought to occur in relation to this particular proposal. They have made it quite clear, time and time again, over many, many years, after many, many studies into Ben Lomond, that under no circumstances do they want a uranium mine in their backyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, studies reveal that if that uranium mine went ahead there is every possibility that the water supply for the people in Charters Towers would be adversely affected. I think that the Leader of the National Party should get himself into Charters Towers as soon as he possibly can to explain to the people in that particular city what he is on about when he says that the Ben Lomond mine will go ahead. Not only that, the previous National Party member for that State seat of Charters Towers, a person by the name of Bob Katter, Jr, who is well known to you, I am sure, Madam Deputy Speaker, is running for the Federal seat of Kennedy. He has made it quite clear that, despite what the Leader of the National Party says and despite what the Leader of the Opposition says in relation to the mining of uranium at Ben Lomond, he will make sure that his voice is heard in this Parliament and that uranium mining will not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is this: he is a member of a party which believes that the Ben Lomond uranium mine should go ahead. He is one of those old brigade of the National Party that say one thing in the bush and do something totally different when they get to parliament; that is certainly evidenced by his ranting and raving over the many years that he has been in State parliament. So, whilst I certainly commend this Bill to the House, I urge the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition to rethink their parties' policy, particularly as it relates to energy and resources. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's only direct hands-on role in natural gas operations is through TPA, an independent statutory authority. Its existing contracts with the Australian Gas Light Co. restrict the Pipeline Authority to a cost recovery non-commercial basis of operating the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system through which passes about 7 per cent of the total energy consumed by New South Wales. The Authority's main pipeline extends over 1,300 kilometres from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. Lateral pipelines also supply gas from Young to Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga and from Dalton to Canberra. An extension of the pipeline to the Riverina towns of Leeton, Narrandera and Griffith is also under construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that it was announced in the Budget that the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system has been reinstated to the program of major asset sales. However, the fact that the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline system has been listed for sale by the Government in no way diminishes the important role it has to play in the development of interstate gas pipelines; nor should it cause deferment of the reform of the Pipeline Authority. A sale of the pipeline system is unlikely to occur before 1993-94. Meanwhile, it is essential that the Pipeline Authority operate in the most efficient manner leading up to a sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make it clear that there is nothing in this legislation that would inhibit the future sale or disposal of the Moomba to Sydney pipeline system. The proposed reforms would see the Pipeline Authority set up a subsidiary and operate in accordance with government business enterprise accountability guidelines. This subsidiary could become involved in a wider range of commercial activities than the Pipeline Authority's present Act and its existing long term haulage contracts allow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed subsidiary would enable the Pipeline Authority to become a more effective operator in the gas sector. It is proposed that the subsidiary would take over those operations of the Pipeline Authority which are based on a commercial rate of return, including the Canberra and Oberon pipelines and the proposed Riverina pipeline extension to Griffith. The Authority would continue to own and operate the remainder of the pipeline system on a cost recovery basis in accordance with its contracts with the Australian Gas Light Co., that is, until such time as its assets are sold by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the Pipeline Authority transports natural gas for only one customer, AGL. The Government has consulted with AGL on the proposed transfer of the Canberra and Oberon pipelines to the subsidiary and on the preparation of this legislation. There is no element in the reform proposals in this legislation that would be prejudicial to AGL's existing contracts or its gas supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of assets to the subsidiary will be revenue neutral in that no tax liability will be incurred on the transfer, but the subsidiary will thereafter be subject to the taxation applicable to a commercial corporation. The assets to be transferred are, on current market terms, assessed to be in the range of $12m to $15m, but are to be revalued as part of the transfer. The objective is for the subsidiary's capital base to be structured so that it can achieve an A credit rating. Any borrowings of the subsidiary will then not be subject to government guarantee although subject to Loan Council approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past TPA has been constrained by its Act and its contracts with AGL in the types of activities it can undertake and the profitability of those activities, particularly the haulage of gas on the main Moomba to Sydney pipeline. It is proposed that the new subsidiary would have wider functions than the Pipeline Authority, including the provision of consultancy and transmission support services relating to pipeline construction, design and operation in Australia and overseas. However, I should stress that the proposed subsidiary would not be advantaged in any way relative to private companies competing for commercial opportunities in the gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To all intents and purposes the subsidiary is designed to behave as a private company carrying out the business of a government business enterprise and subject to corporate law and regulations and the Trade Practices Act. The subsidiary will be subject to taxation and will be required to make dividend payments. As such the reforms are consistent with the recommendations of the Industry Commission inquiry into energy generation and distribution relating to the corporatisation of public utilities. The creation of a subsidiary to separate the Pipeline Authority's commercial and non-commercial operations in the manner proposed will provide the correct commercial incentives for the management of the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also amend the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 in other ways to assist the Pipeline Authority's future role. It is proposed that the Pipeline Authority's board of directors will be expanded by two new directors to give it an appropriate mix of qualifications, abilities and business acumen to pursue the new directions proposed for the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the passing on to the Commonwealth, via the Pipeline Authority, of dividends paid by the subsidiary except for any amounts specified by the Minister. This will ensure that there is proper financial independence of the Pipeline Authority and its subsidiary and also ensure that the community receives an appropriate return from the commercial operations of the subsidiary. There is nothing in the Bill to enable the Commonwealth to extract extraordinary dividends from the Pipeline Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Minister will approve financial targets for the Authority and the subsidiary, it is recognised that compliance with the targets will depend fundamentally on the existing contractual conditions, and the financial performance and responsibilities of the subsidiary will be strictly in accordance with Corporations Law. The capital and other financial resources to be transferred by the Authority to the subsidiary, in exchange for share equity plus the revenue earning capability of the Canberra and Oberon pipelines, and when built the Riverina pipeline extension, should permit the payment of dividends by the subsidiary at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 will implement necessary and timely reforms. These reforms will allow the boards of the Authority and its subsidiary to assume proper responsibility for the development of business strategies and the handling of day to day management policies. At the same time appropriate ministerial control will be imposed by the oversight of the subsidiary's strategic corporate plans, annual operating plans and financial targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms will enable the Authority, through its subsidiary, to compete for emerging opportunities in the development of natural gas transmission in Australia. The reforms will also ensure that the Authority's involvement is on an efficient and fair basis. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments that the coalition parties move tonight put beyond doubt the ability of the Government, or the coalition in government, to privatise the pipeline, the Pipeline Authority or other assets associated with the Pipeline Authority. The Government knows, as we know, that legal advice indicates that, although the matter is not without some doubt, the Government is almost certainly in a position to privatise the assets of the Pipeline Authority&mdash;which is the Government's stated position and the coalition's stated position&mdash;but tonight we seek to ensure that no legal obstacle exists that would preclude that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been discussed with the Government, and I want to thank the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Minister's office, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table, for agreeing that the Government will not oppose these amendments. The Parliamentary Secretary has told me that he will say, as far as the Government is concerned, that it does not think that the amendments are necessary. But as I said earlier, my legal advice is that they will put the matter beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary, we regret that the Government did not take advantage of the opportunity that it could have availed itself of a couple of years ago in order to proceed to the privatisation of the pipeline in accordance with the coalition's policy. At that time the Government sought to set aside some commercial contracts that we regarded as having been entered into on an arm's length basis and sought to change those commercial contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very pleased to say that the Government has now set aside its view that existed a couple of years ago and has put forward this Bill which will allow for the privatisation, in our view, of the spur lines, but it does leave in some doubt the question of whether the Government can privatise the pipeline system. But these amendments the coalition is putting forward, with which the Government agrees, will set the question beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should briefly canvass the views of the coalition on why the Pipeline Authority or the Pipeline Authority's pipeline and other assets should be privatised. Why follow the privatisation programs that now exist in 86 countries around the world? The coalition parties believe that individuals and companies can run enterprises better than governments. Governments should be relieved of operating commercial organisations so they can carry out their core activities more effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say in passing&mdash;since the question was raised by my friend the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), because it is through his electorate the pipeline passes and it is in his electorate that there are some employees of the Pipeline Authority&mdash;that the coalition will endeavour to find a way in which employees of the Pipeline Authority can participate in the future ownership of its pipeline and other assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is well known that there have been some legal proceedings associated with the proposed privatisation of the Pipeline Authority and its assets. It would appear, based on decisions that have been handed down in the courts, that the Australian Gas Light Co. may well have a first right of refusal on the sale of the Pipeline Authority and its assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to canvass the merits or otherwise of the court decision, except to say that, if it is true that the Australian Gas Light Co. does have that first right of refusal and chooses to exercise it, the coalition will endeavour to find a way in which the employees of the Pipeline Authority can participate in the future ownership of the pipeline and its other assets. As I say, I do not choose to canvass the merits or otherwise of the legal situation there, but I think it is important for my friend the honourable member for Gilmore, for the Pipeline Authority and for its employees that a way should be found through which they can participate in future ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the coalition believes is that, if the privatisation process is to achieve the objectives that we set out, it is important that employees of any organisation or any enterprise that is to be privatised feel that they are part of that process, feel that they are part of workplace agreements that might arise and feel that they are part of the future ownership of any enterprise that is privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add in passing that the new Kennett Liberal-National Party Government in Victoria was given a strong mandate for privatisation and contracting out. As we know, that process of privatisation&mdash;which to some degree has been embraced reluctantly and lately by the Government&mdash;should be used to enhance competition; to allow market pressures to force an improved performance from the enterprise to be privatised, both from the financial markets and the share markets; to lower government debt; and to ensure that we have a broader spread of ownership of the nation's assets amongst the people of Australia. As I said earlier, it should be used to ensure that employees can participate in the ownership of the enterprises in which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that the coalition moves tonight are firmly in line with the coalition's policy of making Australia more efficient and more competitive. I want to say again that I appreciate very much that the Government has indicated that it will support these amendments, and I commend them to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill in detail it is necessary to put some of the current tax debate in context. For that reason I foreshadow moving an amendment which has been circulated in my name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) continue to portray Australia as a low tax country, which is just a small part of their more general complacency about the need for fundamental economic reform to take place in this country. In particular, they often claim that tax revenue as a proportion of GDP is lower in Australia than in many OECD countries. This may be true of the OECD, but as I have said on previous occasions, that is nothing to boast about given the economic problems faced by many OECD countries, problems that are often similar to our own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular comparison ignores, however, the costs that the operation of the tax system imposes on the economy, quite apart from the total amount of revenue that the tax system raises. It is one thing to measure the total revenue take against GDP and to set that against the performance of other countries. But it is also necessary to measure the compliance and collection costs that the tax system imposes on the rest of the economy, as well as the distortionary impact of the tax system on economic activity, if we are to get a true picture of the burden of taxation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are fortunate in this country that a number of individuals and organisations have carried out research into the compliance burden imposed by our system of taxation. We are fortunate because there have been few such studies carried out in other countries where the important question of compliance costs tends to be also ignored. Indeed, it was almost totally ignored in Australia until a few years ago, and we are only just now beginning to fill some lamentable gaps in our knowledge of compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Tax Research Foundation and the Business Council of Australia have sponsored a number of studies into tax compliance costs. These have included a number of studies by Mr Jeff Pope from the School of Economics and Finance at Curtin University in my State of Western Australia and Mr Richard Fayle from the Department of Accounting and Finance at the University of Western Australia. The studies were recently summarised in a paper by Jeff Pope entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Compliance Cost of Taxation in Australia: An Economic and Policy Perspective</EMPHASIS>, which I would commend as recommended reading to all honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things about these studies is the disdain in which they are held by the Australian Taxation Office. This is probably not surprising, since the picture they paint of taxation in Australia is not a very rosy one. In a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Mr Bill Godfrey, Second Commissioner of Taxation, was largely dismissive of attempts to measure the compliance costs of taxation in Australia. At one point, he even said that the attempt to measure the economic cost of compliance and to make comparisons with overseas countries was `the ultimate exercise in futility'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it should not be surprising that the Tax Office would be sensitive on the issue since it has sought to push the compliance costs of the tax system onto taxpayers through the self-assessment system. This is not to say that the move to self-assessment has not been a desirable one overall; but we should not ignore the fact that one of the consequences is to increase the compliance burden of the tax system and the requirement that we pay particular attention to the complexity of tax law in order to ensure that it does not constitute an undue or avoidable burden on taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, we should not be impressed with Tax Office statistics which show that the ATO's collection costs were only one per cent or so of the total revenue it collected in 1990-91. The costs of collecting tax have simply been shifted onto taxpayers. These costs go largely unmeasured, except for the work of a few private individuals and organisations  that have recognised its importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suspects that the Tax Office is dismissive of this work simply because it shows the Australian taxation system in a less than flattering light. If these studies were to show that the compliance burden in Australia was low by international standards, one can almost imagine an ATO publicity blitz being launched to tell us the good news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Jeff Pope's most recent paper, he has sought to measure compliance costs for the year 1990-91 by uplifting the results obtained in an earlier study for the year 1986-87. The results suggest personal income tax compliance costs of around $3.5 billion to $5 billion per annum, which represents between 7 and 10 per cent of the $50.168 billion income tax revenue take for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of these compliance costs shows that low taxable incomes incur the highest compliance burden. For those earning up to $10,000, compliance costs account for 10.5 per cent of taxable income; whereas compliance costs amount to only 3.8 per cent of taxable income for those earning $50,000 or more. The results for public companies' income tax reveal compliance costs of between $744m and $1.545 billion, or 10 per cent to 21 per cent of company income tax revenue in 1988-89. Of these compliance costs, the study notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The usual regressive nature of business taxes was observed, with compliance costs falling from just under two dollars for every $100 of turnover for companies with a turnover of up to $5 million P.A. to about four cents for every $100 of turnover for companies with a turnover of $100 million P.A. or over. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interesting thing about these figures is not so much the absolute compliance burden they reveal, but the fact that comparison with similar studies overseas shows that compliance costs in Australia are very high by international standards. The compliance costs of personal income tax are 2.5 per cent in Canada, 3.6 per cent in the United Kingdom, and from 5 per cent to 7 per cent in the United States, compared with up to 11 per cent in Australia in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar results are obtained when we look at the hours spent annually on tax affairs in different countries. These amount to 3.6 hours in the United Kingdom, 5.5 in Canada, 10.7 in Australia, and we do trail the United States in this where the figure is 21.7 hours. Australia also has the highest percentage use of professional tax advisers, with 10.5 per cent in the United Kingdom, 39 per cent in Canada, 46 per cent in the United States, and a whopping 62 per cent in Australia. The results for public companies' income tax show that compliance costs in Australia are five to 11 times greater than those in the United Kingdom as a percentage of tax revenue, and three to seven times greater when expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jeff Pope concludes his study by giving us an overall assessment of the economic cost of the compliance burden in Australia, saying that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a conservative estimate, if the level of the compliance costs of personal income taxation in Australia at their lower estimate were to be reduced to a similar level to that given by the highest estimate in the USA, the socio-economic resource savings would be around $415 million in 1990-91 prices.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, if the compliance costs of public companies' income taxation in Australia at their lowest estimate were to be reduced to a similar level to those in the UK, the economic resource savings would be around $681 million in 1990-91 figures. Together they account for potential benefits of at least $1,096 million in 1990-91 prices. This represents 1.6% of 1990-91 income taxation revenue or 0.3% of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>This represents some impressive potential gains to be had, simply by matching the performance of the United States and the United Kingdom in lowering tax compliance costs. Obviously we could do even better if we were to target best international practice as the coalition advocates in all areas. Pope also gives some advice on how to achieve this lower compliance burden. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a `rule-of-thumb', fewer taxes and broader bases, with minimal exemptions and reliefs, tend to minimise compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA>All of which, I suggest, sounds very much like the outcome from the implementation of the coalition's tax reforms as set out in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we should not allow anyone to get away with claiming that Australia is a low taxed country compared with the rest of the world, while failing to take account of the compliance costs to taxpayers. When compliance costs are taken into account, Australia is probably one of the highest taxing countries in the western world. This is all the more evident when one appreciates that much of the work on compliance costs in Australia uses data which predates the introduction of many of the new self-assessment measures. Subsequent new measures are likely to have made a considerable addition to the compliance costs to which I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to lowering the overall tax take in this country, we should also be looking to lower the overall tax burden by reducing compliance costs wherever possible. One of the most important ways in which compliance costs can be reduced is to simplify the tax laws. The Government has had a number of simplification projects operating over the past few years, focusing on personal income tax and wholesale sales tax. Unfortunately, these simplification projects have not made much progress. We all know what a disaster the wholesale sales tax simplification exercise has been, and we have still seen only some of the comparatively minor results of the income tax simplification project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become apparent, however, that the Tax Office is not really interested in tax law simplification. To the extent that it maintains an interest in simplification issues, it is more active in simplifying the law from a Tax Office perspective than it is in addressing the difficulties faced by taxpayers. Some recent comments by Tax Office officials are indicative of this attitude. The Commissioner, Mr Boucher, has made a number of speeches in which we has sought to down play the importance of and expected benefits from tax law simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Mr Barrie Russell, the ATO official responsible for overseeing the introduction of the new sales tax system, has since renounced the simplification objective, and when one looks at the new wholesale sales tax system, it is not hard to see why. In a recent interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Mr Russell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simplification was the wrong word and I doubt that it is ever going to be used again. It builds up expectations of something really simple and when you're dealing with tax law, and you're dealing with the myriad of tax policy objectives that any government is faced with, there are limits on how far it can go. A better term would be modernisation of the law or rationalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Rest in peace the much vaunted tax simplification jargoneering from this Government. These comments fit in well with an observation made by Jeff Pope that the Government's simplification review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . seems to have placed emphasis on improving the simplicity of the ATO's administrative system rather than simplicity from the taxpayer's compliance viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is thus an irony or contradiction: the ATO stresses the benefits of self-assessment in terms of simplification and efficiency (from its own viewpoint rather than from an overall perspective) whilst at the same time having policies which encourage the use of professional advisers, who now have more onerous responsibilities and penalties for failure to meet these.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the high level of the compliance burden in Australia, the present Government is doing very little about it. The Government has failed to undertake the important task of tax reform in this country, so it continues to preside over an inefficient and distortionary tax system. At the same time, it would appear to have given up on tax law simplification&mdash;if it were ever serious about that objective in the first place. So we are burdened with a double whammy of a range of inefficient and distortionary taxes that are also underwritten by complex and costly tax laws. So much for Australia being a low tax country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to now turn to the detail of the two Bills before us. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill authorises double taxation arrangements between Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Spain. These arrangements are generally in accord with the various other comprehensive tax agreements that Australia has concluded with other countries in recent years. They do not give rise to any difficulties from the point of view of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is an omnibus Bill that makes a number of changes to the tax laws. The Bill implements the decision of the `One Nation, One Job' statement to tax income derived by offshore banking units, commonly abbreviated to OBUs, from borrowing and lending to non-residents at a concessional income tax rate of 10 per cent. The measure is designed to help Australia become an offshore banking centre and to help Australia become more integrated with the economies of the Asia-Pacific region by becoming an expanded financial centre. While these are highly desirable goals, there are a number of potential problems with this legislation as drafted and with the amendments that have been presented by the Government already; amendments to the Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument to the effect that life companies and other fund management institutions engaged in providing financial services to non-residents should be able to access the OBU arrangement on the same basis as banks and foreign exchange dealers. This would ensure that there was neutral taxation treatment of different financial institutions engaged in exactly the same activities; namely, the provision of financial services to non-residents. Under this legislation, banks and foreign exchange dealers will face an effective tax rate of 10 per cent on profits earned from designated OBU activities, whereas life companies will face higher rates of tax because they are unable to establish OBUs. This would appear to give rise to some serious distortions in the provision of financial services by different types of financial institutions and place Australian life companies at a competitive disadvantage. As such, this Bill is incomplete as a measure designed to underpin the competitiveness of Australian financial institutions, providing financial services in the Asia-Pacific region, and the Government should examine the issue more broadly than it has done to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the OBU provisions do not address the competitive disadvantages we face as a result of our burdensome tax system more generally. It should be noted that the Australian Financial Centre committee recently handed down a report which concluded that Federal and State taxes were the primary factor inhibiting the growth of Sydney as a regional financial centre. Mr John McMurtrie, Managing Director of the Merchant Bank UBS Australia and Deputy Chairman of the Australian Merchant Bankers Association, has also made similar points. He has pointed out that the high cost of compliance with government and Reserve Bank requirements and Australia's high tax rates were discouraging foreign banks from operating locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting what Geoff Lehmann of Price Waterhouse had to say on the subject. After noting that the Tax Office has for many years argued against Australia trying to compete against Singapore in the taxation of financial services, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the past decade, they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Tax Office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have done Australia a disservice by arguing for new tax laws that have given us the world's second most complex tax system after the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">London's international pre-eminence as a financial centre is the result of many factors. But it would not have retained that pre-eminence if Canberra bureaucrats had been running the inland revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>That is damning stuff. So we should not kid ourselves that this one tax concession, albeit an important one, is suddenly going to make us tax competitive and a major regional financial centre. We have to address the full range of tax reform issues if we are serious about becoming competitive, which is exactly what the coalition's Fightback package of reforms seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a number of amendments to the capital gains tax provisions. These amendments concern the infamous terrible twins: subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7) of the Income Tax Assessment Act that are designed to assess certain capital payments not received in respect of the actual disposal of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions have been the cause of a great deal of uncertainty amongst tax practitioners and have been the subject of consideration by the courts, all of which has served to create more confusion and uncertainty. These amendments are designed to clarify the application of the law. Drafts of these amendments have been made widely available in an attempt to ensure the clarity of these proposed provisions. The amendments set out a scheme for the taxing of capital payments not received and where the actual disposal of assets is present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides that where a taxpayer creates an incorporeal asset in another person, any consideration, less incidental costs, received by the taxpayer for creating the asset will be a capital gain to the taxpayer. Subsection 160M(7) will have a residual operation to tax payments not received in respect of the disposal or creation of assets. A number of technical amendments are also proposed dealing with the operation of subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although drawn up on the basis that there should be no change in tax policy, these amendments still create a number of difficulties and do not necessarily clarify the operation of the law. There has always been an inequity when a right of easement or profit a prendre is granted in circumstances where the original asset value has diminished, and there should be an adjustment to the cost base of the original asset consistent with the remainder of the capital gains tax in part IIIA of the Act. The amendments mean that easements and the like are to be treated as creations without recourse to a cost base other than incidental costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill identifies the need to eliminate the prospect of double taxation where the disposal gives rise to rights which themselves are assets for the purpose of the capital gains tax, but the amendment limits the liability to double taxation only to clauses 160M(6) and 160M(7), and not to the remainder of the capital gains tax provisions that may also give rise to double taxation situations. The amendments also have the potential to apply to situations in which it would be unreasonable or unrealistic to seek to apply capital gains tax. The explanatory memorandum sets out the implications for subsection 160M(6) but not, surprisingly, for 160M(7). The terrible twins, to the extent that they might have been Siamese twins, have been separated, at least in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other difficulties are created by the amended definition of an asset and the definition of vest. It would seem unlikely that the proposed changes to the capital gains tax provisions will serve to greatly clarify the law in the manner claimed and suggested by the Government. They also potentially add a number of distortionary consequences to the operation of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) also makes changes to the penalties for late payment of tax and related penalties. The Bill reduces the late payment penalties from 20 per cent per annum to 16 per cent per annum from 1 October 1992. This amendment is designed to reflect lower market interest rates and it brings Tax Office penalties more into line with commercial realities. This amendment complements changes made by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992, which split the late payment penalty into penalty and interest rate components. These provisions do not come into effect until tax payable for the 1992-93 year of income is overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment in this Bill will reduce penalty rates for earlier years of income. The Bill also seeks to correct an anomaly whereby retrenchees from the textile, clothing and footwear industry who derive TCF special allowance are not eligible for a rebate of income tax, whereas other retrenchees of these industries who derive similar benefits under formal training assistance are eligible for a rebate. The coalition has no difficulty with the removal of this anomaly. In conclusion, the coalition will not be opposing the Bill. However, we draw attention to a number of problems with the legislation as drafted which the Government's amendments fail to address, particularly in relation to the capital gains tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I bring to the attention of the House the Australia Council's collection development program. I do not know whether honourable members are aware that the Australia Council's Visual Art and Crafts Board discontinued funding the collection development program in 1989. The board has reinstated the collection development program, which previously provided $100,000, and will now endeavour to secure $400,000. A Federal grant would hinge on the support of the local community. In a community we would expect councils, commerce, service clubs and friends of the art gallery societies to help raise money for the gallery. Essentially, in the future, grants will be made on a dollar for dollar basis but limited to grants of $50,000 and $25,000. In essence, for councils to apply for the minimum grant of $25,000, a similar sum needs to be either provided by the council or raised in the community. Many people are of the opinion that a number of galleries, particularly smaller regional galleries or galleries which have very limited funds, will be disadvantaged by the abovementioned decision, particularly given that these galleries will have to find a minimum of $25,000 before applications for the grants can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A typical example is the Wagga Wagga City Art Gallery, which has one of the finest glass collections in Australia as well as having a very fine print collection. It will find it very difficult to raise $25,000 so that it can obtain a dollar for dollar grant. My reason for rising tonight is to ask the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to see whether this program can be changed so that those galleries which are not able to raise $25,000 can still obtain the dollar for dollar grant on amounts much less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am speaking about the city of Wagga Wagga, I mention the Charles Sturt University winery. Wine grapes were first grown in that area in 1893, but it was not until the state of the art building was built in 1977 to support the Charles Sturt University teaching program that winemaking really got under way. It was restructured in 1989 to put it on a commercial basis. Dr Brian Freeman, associate professor of wine science and viticulture, was appointed executive director of the winery to ensure that the educational role of the winery was maintained. Dr Freeman is noted not only in Australia but also overseas for his expertise. Rodney Hooper is the wine maker and manager, and the marketing plan was devised by Graham Cossey. The cellar door is managed by Beryl Moore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The improved facilities have enabled grape processing for a number of wine makers. To fulfil the contract, the winery is operated for up to 24 hours a day to provide an exciting atmosphere for the students who have worked until 3 a.m., not only for the love of the course but also to make sure that they pass their exams.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to inform the House tonight of a campaign on the north coast of New South Wales to save an endangered but beautiful insect. That campaign initially took few people by storm, but things are changing and the plight of the Richmond birdwinged butterfly has now captured the imagination of many of the residents of the north coast of New South Wales. I hope that in time the birdwinged butterfly, or Ornithoptera richmondia, will be declared a living emblem of that area, and that its breeding habitat will be restored and its future will become secure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Richmond birdwinged butterfly is one of Australia's largest and most spectacular butterfly species. The male butterfly has bright wing panels of lime green and gold, surrounded by a black border with a bright yellow abdomen and red thorax. The female is larger, with a wingspan of up to 180 millimetres, and is smoky grey with a yellowish panel in the wing enclosing a black spot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, for all its beauty, the birdwinged butterfly is in danger. Bob Moffat, a National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger, started a campaign to save the butterfly, and that campaign has been snowballing ever since. Few things have captured the imagination of the people of the north coast as much as this butterfly. Its plight is linked with the aspirations of the area, with regrowth, beauty and a prosperous future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The birdwinged butterfly was once common on the north coast, but it is becoming endangered because of the clearing of what once was a huge area of rainforest, known locally as the big scrub. Only remnants of that big scrub now remain. The rainforest provided the only source of food for the birdwing, a vine called aristolochia praevenosa. Aristolochia vines are native to the New South Wales-Queensland border region. They have deeply veined leaves and interesting large cream and mauve-maroon tubular flowers. Though the butterflies lay their eggs on other vines, the young birdwing larvae will develop only on the praevenosa vine in a warm coastal rainforest habitat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not so long ago Lismore's daily newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Star</EMPHASIS>, started publishing articles warning of the danger of extinction of the birdwing, and ran a full colour front-page photograph. At that time, people rallied to offer their assistance. The CSIRO became involved soon after, and worked with Mr Moffat in providing stock plants of aristolochia to the Balunya nursery on the north coast. The nursery is owned and operated by the Kurachee Aboriginal Cooperative Society. Later, plants were provided through the north coast regional office of the Department of Education to 40 schools in the Ballina, Byron Bay and Lismore area. They were planted on Arbour Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Nursery Industry Association are now involved, and it intends to identify the butterfly on labels attached to all the plants it sells. These will help to identify the origins of aristolochia, highlight the habitat of the butterfly and generate funds for its protection. The image of the butterfly is also to be printed on T-shirts and sold at various outlets around the north coast, the funds from that again going to the butterfly's protection. ABC Regional Radio in Lismore and the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Star</EMPHASIS>, Doug Parrington, have offered their strong support for any programs to save the habitat of the remaining butterflies and thereby ensure its protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Richmond birdwinged butterfly project won the New South Wales' non-government environmental category of the Vision of Australia Awards for 1992. An educational video which highlights the plight of the butterfly has been developed and distributed to schools and to the local community. Bob Moffat, the National Parks ranger who initiated the campaign, planted the aristolochia vines in his own backyard and he now has birdwings laying eggs on these vines. With proper vines, the Richmond birdwing can be encouraged into any backyard in the area, and that is offering the promise that the birdwing can be saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Bob Moffat's initial injection of enthusiasm, the program to save the birdwing has taken off.

The program to save this beautiful emblem for the area has involved the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, the New South Wales Department of School Education, the CSIRO, the Aboriginal community, the Nursery Industry Association, the media and many other individuals.

When I refer to our obligations to the retired, I mean not only to age pensioners but also to the self-funded retirees. The self-funded retirees have done what we are increasingly telling people they should be doing&mdash;saved for their retirement. Many in this group are not treated well, considering the efforts and sacrifices they have made during their working lives. To illustrate, an age pensioner with maximum non-taxable additional earnings can have an income of $10,200 tax free. A self-funded retiree who is not entitled to claim any part of the age pension starts paying tax at $5,400, is required to pay provisional tax and has to pay the full cost of services which are available free or at a reduced cost to the age pensioner as a fringe benefit. This puts many self-funded retirees of modest means&mdash;up to $18,000 a year&mdash;in a position where they are not much better off after a lifetime of saving than if they had not bothered to save at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With low interest rates, many self-funded retirees now find themselves in a difficult position. Quite a few are wondering why they should go on juggling their investments with all the associated worry and risk when it might be easier to spend their capital and fall increasingly back on the pension. If this is to be avoided&mdash;and if people now in the work force  are  to  have  an incentive  to  invest for retirement&mdash;these inequalities in government policy on the aged need to be corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons why there is such growing disillusionment with the workings of the Parliament is that there is a widespread belief held by many Australians that the party system so dictates the actions and views of members that there is little scope for individual expressions of opinion. Most, if not all, honourable members would know that sitting through a day of the proceedings of this House would dissuade anyone from that view, given the wide variety of opinions and views expressed by individual members of all political parties. Nonetheless, it is true that there are not very many opportunities for our constituents to directly express their opinions to the national Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me tonight, I would like to express one such opinion using the words of Mr Peter Mulheron of Loch Sport in my electorate of Gippsland. Mr Mulheron is a well-known correspondent to many rural and metropolitan newspapers. He is a man of firm and independent opinions, who holds the respect of a wide segment of the community for his fearless advocacy of often unpopular issues. In a way he acts as a conscience for many people. Mr Speaker, I will now read out, for the information of honourable members, a particular issue that Mr Mulheron feels very strongly about. His wrote to me recently in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr McGauran,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir, I wish to inform you that despite calls by Mr Robert Cornwall of the Victorian Law Institute and various High Court Judges advocating a `Bill of Rights' and eagerness to rewrite the Constitution, that the Constitution does contain a Bill of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to many Newspaper Editorials of late denying existence of such a Bill, the High Court itself has recognised `freedom of Speech exists in the Constitution'. I will clarify what they omitted. "Laws for good government, freedom of speech and political counsel, and `Liberty of the Subject' to own freehold Lands and chattels" are contained in the Magna Carta, Statutes of Edward I, Edward III, section 28 clause 3 of 1354, the 1688 Bill of Rights, all of which are "incumbent" in the Imperial Applications Acts and the Westminster Adoption Act 1942 upon which the Constitution is wholly based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly public schools have not taught this `Australian History' except for tertiary institutions' Law Faculties, and the people have not questioned the Legal Profession and Parliamentarians whom in my opinion have coveted this information for 91 years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it is my understanding that pressure is upon Parliament and the High Court to incorporate the U.N.'s "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights" into a re-written version of the Constitution in accordance with covert recommendations of the Constitutional Review Commission, and the IHRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The U.N.'s "Charter acknowledges that international Laws may not interfere in government, nor contravene Legally formed Constitutions of Sovereign Nations or Republics", therefore I advise my objection to implementation of U.N.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1-5 and 7-8) In these parts of the question a large amount of detailed information concerning the expenditure of industry contributions to the rural research and development (R&amp;D) corporations and councils has been requested. I do not consider that the time and staff resources required, both within my Department and within the R&amp;D corporations and councils, to collect the level of information requested can be reasonably justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each rural R&amp;D corporation and council is required to include in its annual report details of the R&amp;D program that it has funded during the financial year to which the annual report pertains. In most cases, full details of the research organisation undertaking the research and the level of funding for each R&amp;D project and a split up of funding allocated to private and public sector research organisations is provided. In addition, details of industry contributions are provided in the financial statements of the annual reports for each R&amp;D corporation and council. These annual reports are tabled each year in Parliament.</PARA>

However, to give an indication of recent trends in funding of public sector R&amp;D bodies by the R&amp;D corporations and councils I have provided details of expenditure through public sector R&amp;D bodies as a percentage of total expenditure and as a percentage of industry contributions for 1990-91 (the latest available figures) in Table 1.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The list of 102 States party to the Convention, together with the date of entry into force for each State, has been forwarded to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes, except the relevant designation was for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention, rather than Article 25(3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)-(6) The following answers draw upon information provided by the Attorney General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The question assumes that, by not designating Western Australia as a constituent subdivision for the purposes of Article 25 of the Convention, Australia has thereby "excluded a portion of its metropolitan territory". This assumption reflects a mistaken understanding of the operation of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In ratifying the Convention, the Australian Government did so on behalf of all of the Australian States and Territories. While Article 70 provides a mechanism for excluding particular territory from the application of the Convention, the Government did not rely on this provision for Western Australia or any other part of our territory. Thus, residents of Western Australia, like those of the other States and Territories, remain "Nationals of a Contracting Party" for the purposes of establishing the jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) under Article 25(1) of the Convention. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Western Australia, like the Supreme Courts of the other States and Territories, was designated as a court competent for recognising and enforcing arbitral awards made under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Designation of constituent subdivisions for the purposes of Article 25 is optional for Contracting Parties, and has the effect of enlarging the potential jurisdiction of the Centre to include not only disputes between nationals of one Contracting Party and another Contracting Party, but also disputes between such nationals and the constituent subdivisions of a Contracting Party. In practical terms, designation of particular States or Territories affords to those Governments an option they would not otherwise have; that is, the ability to offer potential investors in their State or Territory the additional assurance of access to an internationally recognised specialist dispute resolution procedure. Even when so designated, however, the jurisdiction of the Centre requires the consent of both parties to the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The option of designating constituent subdivisions appears to have been pursued by only one other Contracting Party&mdash;the United Kingdom in respect of certain offshore territories including Bermuda, Hong Kong, Guernsey and Jersey. By contrast, countries such as the United States of America, Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany, which have federal structures in some ways analogous to that of Australia, have not pursued designation of their sub-national levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) This question appears to proceed on the same misunderstanding as Question 4. Most international agreements do not give Australia the option of applying the relevant obligations to only some of the States and mainland Territories. Nor would Australia seek to exclude from the application of an international Convention any of the States or mainland Territories. Nevertheless, situations may arise where different levels of participation are expressly provided for in a Convention. Australia might take advantage of these different levels as between the constituent elements of mainland Australia provided that no overriding national interest is offended. The ICSID Convention provides one such example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Government consulted closely with the States in considering its attitude to the designation of constituent subdivisions for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. The Government was of the view that while such designation was primarily a matter for the States and Territories concerned, designation of all such Governments could offer the advantage of presenting a uniform dispute settlement regime for potential investors in Australia. The Western Australian Government expressed a preference for not being so designated when this issue was first canvassed with it in 1976, and adhered to that position in subsequent approaches made by the Government in 1978 and 1984. This matter was again raised with the Western Australian Government in early 1991 when the Government was finalising arrangements for Australia's ratification of the Convention. While Western Australia confirmed its previous position, the Government indicated its preparedness to designate Western Australia at some later stage should there be a change in its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Australia lodged its instrument of ratification to the Convention in May 1991&mdash;when it also designated Australia's relevant constituent subdivisions and courts for the purposes of the Convention&mdash;the Government has not further pursued this question with Western Australia.</PARA>
