<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Friday, 28 August 1992, of former Senator the Hon. Sir Thomas Charles Drake-Brockman, DFC, Senator for the State of Western Australia from 1958 to 1978, Minister for Air from 1969 to 1972, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Administrative Services in 1975 and Deputy President of the Senate from 1965 to 1969 and 1976 to 1978, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Thomas Charles Drake-Brockman was born on 15 May 1919 at Toodyay, Western Australia, and was educated at Guildford Grammar School. He spent his early adult life in the Toodyay troop of the 10th Light Horse Regiment before enlisting in the RAAF in 1941 where he remained in active service until the end of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His accomplishments while in the RAAF were many. He was posted overseas in 1941 as sergeant air-gunner and served in the Middle East, Malta and the United Kingdom. He took part in numerous bombing raids over the Middle East and Europe, and was involved in mine-laying sorties in Tobruk Harbour and also managed to spend time in England as an instructor to an Australian training unit. In October of 1943 he was commissioned as a pilot officer, attaining the rank of flight lieutenant and in 1944 was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in recognition of this enormous contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to entering Federal Parliament, Tom was a farmer and grazier. He was a member of the Wool Executive, then member of the General Executive of the Farmers Union,  President of the Wool Section of the Farmers Union of Western Australia and Vice President of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His long career in Federal Parliament began in 1958 and he was elected a further four times before his retirement in 1978. For six of those years he was Leader of the Country Party in the Senate and for a short period was Acting Leader of the Government in that chamber. His ministerial appointments during that time included: Minister for Air from 1969 to 1972, serving under both John Gorton and Bill McMahon, and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Administrative Services in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His parliamentary appointments included Temporary Chairman of Committees, two terms as Chairman of Committees, Acting President of the Senate and Deputy President of the Senate. Added to all of this, of course, was his membership over the years of several parliamentary committees and also of several parliamentary delegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom maintained close associations with the Country Party, or the National Party as it is now known. From 1963 he was the Federal representative of the State Executive of the Western Australian branch of the National Country Party and member of the Federal Executive Council of the NCP. After his retirement he went on to the post of State President of the NCP and then Federal President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom will be remembered as a friendly man with a great sense of humour. In his role as Chairman of Committees in the Senate he was noted, as he was in all his dealings, for his fairness and integrity which rightly earned him the respect of his peers. He served this country tirelessly in one capacity or another throughout his life. In 1979 he was created a knight bachelor in recognition of his service to the Parliament. On behalf of the Government I extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Mary, and his family in their bereavement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to associate myself with this motion in memory of Tom Drake-Brockman. Tom Drake-Brockman had many friends who remember him, above all, as a brave man and a humorous man. He was a genuine war hero. He was a rear gunner in Wellington and Halifax bombers who flew 63 missions during the Second World War and won a Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1944. On at least one of those missions, it was the particular job of his aircraft to deliberately attract enemy fire so that others could better complete the mission. He built much of the same stoic courage into the Parliament which he entered in 1958 filling for the Country Party a casual Senate vacancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In later years he liked to tell the story of how at a Party room meeting he had rebuked Party leader Black Jack McEwen for treating parliamentarians like a lot of snotty-nosed kids. This apparent insubordination, however, did not stop his promotion to the Ministry in 1969 as Minister for Air. To the end of his career he maintained his Air Force logbook, carefully recording the details of every single flight so that he was able to boast, after 20 years in the Senate, that he had made the transcontinental crossing no fewer than 950 times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was going into the Ministry, Tom Drake-Brockman had been told that he would get the repatriation portfolio, but he was perturbed when he found instead that his job was to keep the F111s in the air and to run the VIP aerial taxi service for politicians. Nevertheless, as he told the story, he started off on the right foot by reminding his departmental secretary, who was really boss, `I think you've been Minister for too long'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps his greatest political achievement was the harmony that he brought to coalition relations in the Senate as Country Party Leader between 1969 and 1975. His commitment to working in total unity with his Liberal parliamentary colleagues foreshadowed the harmony of the present day. Throughout the Whitlam period, Reg Withers and Tom Drake-Brockman worked in unison and managed to force two double dissolutions in just 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects Drake-Brockman seemed an old-fashioned politician. He was an unashamed defender of rural interests who nominated the establishment of the Wool Commission as his finest parliamentary work. He was also a canny grassroots politician; a Catholic who stressed to his Anglican friends the fact that he had been to Guilford Grammar School, and who parleyed his membership of the RSL and many other community groups into a formidable vote in the city as well as in the bush. While Tom Drake-Brockman is no longer with us, we can remember him every time we see someone wearing a member's green lapel pin or a senator's red lapel pin, for it was his committee on parliamentary security which recommended this form of identification. I extend my sympathy to his family and to his friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great sadness that I rise to support this condolence motion for the Hon. Sir Thomas Charles Drake-Brockman, DFC. As others have said, Tom Drake-Brockman for many years was a senator for Western Australia, a member of the then Country Party, National Country Party and Leader in the Senate. For many years he was the heart and soul of the then National Country Party in Western Australia. He gave determined and dedicated service and provided cohesion to the Senate team both within and between coalition parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom Drake-Brockman was a farmer and grazier. He was also very active in Western Australian rural politics before he entered the Senate. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out, he was President of the wool section of the Farmers Union of Western Australia and undertook many related roles. He enjoyed his work as Deputy President of the Senate, serving from 1965 to 1969 in that capacity&mdash;just ahead of the then Senator Tom Bull from Narrandera, near my home, who succeeded him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also one of the few Ministers representing the armed forces individual arms and the last Minister for Air, from 1969 to 1972. In that capacity he had the courage to reject a request from Malcolm Fraser for a VIP aircraft. That was an interesting move he made at the time. No doubt he was applying the guidelines and acting fairly and extremely courageously in rejecting the request of Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of record subsequently after the 1975 election that he was overlooked in the final Ministry of the Fraser Government. However, I have to say that perhaps that was not the reason because, sadly, there was a very long Senate count in the 1975 election. That Senate count went on for several extra weeks. There was a need to complete the formation of the Cabinet at the time, and so Senator Tom Drake-Brockman was not included in the Ministry after that particular election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Leader, he gave good service for his State and great service for the Party. It reflected his meticulous modus operandi as a senator that he travelled the Nullarbor in a very fearless way to deliver on the task at hand. That flows from World War II and the outstanding service he gave, both in the Royal Australian Air Force and previously in the 10th Light Horse Regiment in the CMF during 1938, 1939 and 1940 before switching to the RAAF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, I guess, increasingly fewer former members of the Federal Parliament who gave service in World War II whom we will speak of at the despatch box upon their deaths. Certainly, Tom rates proudly as one who served his Parliament and his country in time of war. His family have a right to be very proud of the contribution he has made. I extend sympathy to his wife, children and grandchildren on his passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the panorama and passion of contemporary politics how easy it is for us to forget the personalities of the people who were part of this place in the past. So it is with Tom Drake-Brockman. Tom has been adequately described by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) as one of those who travelled across the continent frequently. In fact, I am told that he was the longest serving senator, at least on the conservative side, from Western Australia. Those 20 years meant that he saw a great deal of the Nullarbor&mdash;at least from above&mdash;and he certainly came to know a good deal of the people who travelled on the aeroplanes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in that respect to read his valedictory speech to the Senate in which he commented on some advice that was given to him very early in the piece, which was, `It is always wise to know people, but not only those from your side of the House'. I do not know whether that necessarily applies to this Parliament at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say three things about Tom. I knew him well. He was appointed as Minister for Air, as has been said, under Sir John Gorton as Prime Minister, and continued under Bill McMahon. He was then temporarily in the Ministry after 11 November 1975 and, as the Leader of the National Party has just explained, he was not then reappointed to the subsequent Fraser Ministries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom was, first of all, one of those who came into this Parliament in the postwar years. It is very easy for us today to forget the contribution of those men and women. They were there at an extraordinarily difficult time. It was a different generation. Tom left this Parliament a long time ago, but he came into the Parliament at a time when there were few who had not served in their nation's uniform. As has been described, Tom served both in the Light Horse and subsequently in the Royal Australian Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two aspects of his service I think are worth remembering. Firstly, of course, he was awarded the DFC and, secondly, as has been remarked, he served as a wireless air gunner in Halifax and Wellington aircraft. At a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of so many events of World War II it is wise to remember some of the circumstances of those days. Tom was one of those who were involved in the battle above Tobruk. He was there at the time of the battle of El Alamein. He was certainly very much involved in the European war. I was interested this morning to read a letter from Phillip Allwood, DFC, who was also a wireless air gunner and who was writing regarding the fiftieth anniversary of the Royal Air Force Pathfinders Force. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one heavy bombing raid on Nuremburg, Bomber Command lost 96 aircraft; on a raid over Leipzig another 83. Each bomber had a crew of seven&mdash;that's 1253 airmen lost in two nights.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many a night we lost 50 or more aircraft. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 55,000 bomber command airmen were killed in the war over Europe, some 8,500 of them Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many more were wounded and/or captured.</PARA>
<PARA>Tom Drake-Brockman was one of those Australians who survived. He was a great Australian and a great war hero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to his entry into Parliament, and here too I find something of interest. As has been remarked, Tom Drake-Brockman was a farmer. He came from Western Australia, from the sheep and wheat country. Times were not all that bright when he entered Parliament in 1958. I turn to his maiden speech in the Senate on 17 September 1958. It is remarkable how much of that is reminiscent of what is happening today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But let us look at the position to-day. The price of wool has fallen.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In to-day's issue of the "Canberra Times", there is a lot about dumping&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of wool&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but I put it to honourable senators that this country is dumping wool. Month after month we place wool on the auction floor, in prearranged quantities, and sell it irrespective of price. If sufficient buying strength is not present, the man who makes the highest bid gets the wool.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in the hands of the Government to bring stability to the wool industry, if it wants to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Tom was very proud of the contribution he made towards the introduction not only of the Australian Wool Commission but also, subsequently, the minimum reserve price scheme for wool. While that might be another day and another age, I think it is worth remembering that he was one of those who were concerned about those he represented and who effectively translated that representation into political decisions. In remembering him, I commend him for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to tell Mary, his widow; his five children and their families; and his nine grandchildren how proud I was to stand as a representative of this Parliament at his funeral service the other day. Many from across Australia were there. Doug Anthony, Jim Webster and I represented the former Country Party, then the Australian Country Party and now the National Party, at the funeral. I felt it was a farewell of a friend. Tom Drake-Brockman was a friend of farmers and a friend of Australians. He was a great Australian in every way. I treasure his memory and extend my personal sympathy to his widow and his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly on this motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I served in the Parliament with Tom Drake-Brockman for a long time. I had the distinct pleasure to serve with him as a Service Minister from 1969 to 1971. The former Leader of the National Party of Australia and right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has captured in his tribute much of the spirit and memory that those of us who knew him share and think of today. That sort of laconic, decent, honourable Australian is not one that we always associate with in this Parliament. He and I did many a battle with the Minister for Defence of the day, particularly the Minister for Defence from 1969 to 1971. The sense of humour that Tom would bring to bear as he called me after many a battle and sought to regroup I will treasure also. He was a fine man with a wonderful sense of humour; he was absolutely dedicated. It was a pleasure to serve with Tom. I treasure those memories, and I extend my sympathy to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the motion before the House, I begin by extending my condolences to Lady Mary, Tom's immediate family and his close friends. I first met Tom 14 or 15 years ago, not long after he decided not to recontest the election of 1977. Because of that decision, perhaps, I was elected in his stead and became a senator for Western Australia. That was the first kind thing that Tom did for me; it was not planned and it was not deliberate. The second was that I hired his secretary, and she has stayed with me since that time. I know that was something that, again although not planned, Tom approved of very much. She has been a source of strength in my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for self-interest. Tom's military service has been catalogued. He was a soldier briefly. He joined the Air Force, served in two theatres of war and was decorated. Following another stint of farming immediately after the war he became Minister for Air and, as a former Air Force man, it might have been expected that he would take some pleasure from having an Air Vice-Marshal working for him as Minister, but if he did he certainly never let on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom was greatly admired by his peers and his friends. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) refer to his sense of fun. He was indeed a thoroughly decent man. I know the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) wants to be associated with these remarks. He is unable to be in the chamber today because of official duties.

They have all got to then lend at the one rate deemed right by you, with your great well of experience! The exchange rate has fallen. The result, amongst other things, is that Australian competitiveness has improved. One of the issues in the market's judgments about the rate is the terms of trade. They are just about as low as they were in 1986, and the market has made a judgment about that. There is also the fact that Germany, with a total inflation fetish, now has interest rates at 9 per cent, which is putting currency markets around the world under pressure&mdash;most particularly the United States. That is the position. It is not our Budget policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point to the Leader of the Opposition: the Leader of the Opposition is berating us for our budgetary policies when this year we have a stimulus of about one per cent of GDP going into the economy. The Japanese Government has just announced a policy of a fiscal stimulus of 2.3 per cent of GDP for this year. That is of the order of $A9 billion. It is like having the Treasurer stand up and announce a $9 billion package. Let me tell you that Mr Greenspan, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, has said that he hopes that the Japanese package works on the Western economies, because there is not much that US fiscal policy can do. Given the fact that the US Government did not do much about its Budget policies in the good times of the 1980s, it cannot now use fiscal policy to expand the economy and he is hoping that Japan will offset some of the more excessive things being done by the Germans. He is a business economist. He is not someone coming at the economic commentary from the Left, or from some other model, but from a model I should have thought you were quite comfortable with over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this all proves is that everybody is out of step except the Leader of the Opposition! Mr Greenspan is out of step, the Japanese Government is out of step, the Japanese finance Ministry is out of step, and of course the Australian Government is out of step&mdash;its fiscal policy is out of step! The fact is that one of the interesting things about deregulation of the financial system is that banks and others have to try their hands. If they want to lift fixed rate mortgages over a period it will probably affect their business growth. That is a matter of decision for them.</PARA>

Those bilateral arrangements are with Indonesia and Japan&mdash;where I will be going shortly&mdash;and the Government of Kuwait. I am meeting the Emir of Kuwait today.

<PARA>Last week's little somersault was policy on the run if ever you have seen it. It was about one of the most important things ever; that is, focusing the nation's strategic directions for trade, basically to camouflage a blue with the National Party over tariffs on sugar in Queensland, which is the sole point of it. The Leader of the Opposition turned over a policy view which he put in a structured speech in Perth just eight months ago&mdash;and let us not say that things have changed in eight months with great trade arrangements&mdash;and he has turned it on its head. We are now about to join NAFTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Professor Richard Snape made the point that we would get nothing on sugar, beef, dairy or wheat in NAFTA where special protection of agriculture still exists, but we would eliminate protection on motor vehicles and general manufacturing. We would eliminate protection on cars into South Australia from Mexico and other places while we would get no special benefit on sugar, beef, dairy or wheat products. That is obvious, is it not, from the fact that the Canadian trade Minister is today speaking to our trade Minister about the very problem of the EEPs. This is the country which the Opposition says is the No. 1 trade enemy, but which it then lines up to join. The response of the Leader of the Opposition is to enter an arrangement where we get nothing on wheat, nothing on sugar, nothing on beef, but wipe out our car industry. We do that, and we line up and sign up with its declared No. 1 trade enemy.</PARA>

He says that we should toughen it up on Japan by eliminating our motor vehicle tariff to take it to zero so that the Japanese can stream cars into Australia at will and eliminate tariff protection for sugar and other products so that other people around the world can stream their products into this economy. But the notion of a leader of a major party upbraiding in a doorstop interview, in response to pressure from the National Party about sugar tariffs, our largest trading partner which, over a quarter of a century, has given us large and continuing access to its markets and which has produced a huge trade surplus with us, and then seek off the cuff to sign Australia up to the North America Free Trade Agreement when the preponderance of our trade and growth has been in the Asia-Pacific area is wanton, reckless and irresponsible in the extreme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I make the point that this is someone who believes in laissez faire economics, who says the market should rule and the market is right. But when the market speaks about things such as the value of the Australian dollar, by its views about commodities and commodity prices, by its views about competing interest rates on offer around the world and its reflections upon German monetary policy, he says they are wrong and he wants a policy response to those actions. It is like the total confusion on trade. It is laissez faire policies within Australia:  let the market rule; let the market charge what the traffic will bear. But outside of Australia it is all regulation. It is trade deals; it is intervention; it is making arrangements. There is no role for the market there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is not consistent on these things and is, as always, mostly confused. The fact of the matter is that, in the last few weeks, commodity prices have fallen. The various Australian indexes published by the various institutions in Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank, on commodity prices have shown a marked fall. The markets have noticed this and they have made a correction via the exchange rate. You do not think their correction is right. In your mindless arrogance, you do not think the market is right. The judgment is that if the dollar is lower, ipso facto, on the basis of the Leader of the Opposition's argument, it is bad for Australia. Large sections of Australian industry have been calling for a lower dollar for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in the dollar has occurred in the course of this year, and the market has taken note of all these things. To try to say that, with a Budget deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP, with a structural Budget balance sitting in the nineties, with a very tight outlays position, with an inflation rate of 1 1/2 to 2 per cent, in some way the markets are giving up on Australia is a distortion. Not only that, it is doing what the Leader of the Opposition normally does: run Australia into the ground every time he gets a chance. That is his stock in trade. As someone said today, all he ever does is climb up on the difficulties of Australians rather than complimenting them for what they have done and understanding that there are a lot of clever people out there doing a lot of clever things who make judgments about things, and they may not necessarily accord with the Leader of the Opposition. As we have noticed, if people disagree with him, they are marked down and put on a list.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of such claims. I was a little surprised when I first heard these remarks. I tried to find out where the figure of 5,000 came from. I found that it appeared to be drawn from a very partial reading of the Industry Commission report on the automotive industry. This report says that if a range of micro-economic reforms are introduced, the number of jobs in the auto industry may increase by 4,000 than otherwise. With a little embellishment the Leader of the Opposition has made this 5,000. This is the same report that recommended a phase down in tariff levels in the industry to 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were the reforms that were referred to? There was a range of measures, including raising road user fees on trucks&mdash;not by abolishing the excise on fuel, petrol and diesel&mdash;and reforming the electricity industry, which we are seeking to do, sought to do and achieved in principle at the last Premiers Conference. This was acknowledged by only a gruff remark from the Leader of the Opposition. Those were the kinds of changes that the Industry Commission recommended. Most importantly, the reforms analysed kept tariffs on cars unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Leader of the Opposition is claiming is that if protection were removed from all industries, apart from the automobile industry, we would produce more cars. That has nothing to do with his plans to abolish tariff on cars, a policy which would see the demise of the industry. Frankly, the Government and our Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button, have introduced changes to make an efficient and competitive car industry. Fundamental to those changes are work practices; investment in the latest technology; Toyota's plans at Altona, which represent a $750m investment; Mitsubishi's plans for the new Magna in Adelaide, which represent a $600m investment; and Ford's potential investment in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason these companies are making such huge investments&mdash;by world standards they are huge investments&mdash;is that they are confident that there will be a market for their product. They need an end point tariff of 15 per cent. They need export facilitation. Ford has had successes with the Capri. The number of components being exported to Europe and Japan have risen and the new Magna station wagon will be exported to the US, Japan and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these changes, automotive exports have almost doubled in the past three years to now stand at 1,157 million&mdash;1.1 billion. This has given Australians cheaper cars.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been here for 23 years; some would say `too long'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the Minister aware of a claim made by a reporter on the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> last week that `. . . in 1996 sugar tariffs . . . would be down to 5 per cent under Mr Keating but under Dr Hewson they wouldn't reach that level until 2000'? What are the Government's intentions in relation to the sugar tariff?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="455" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Quite simply, the report on the ABC was wrong. I have indicated on previous occasions in this House, as well as to sugar farmers themselves, that our approach is not to adopt the Industry Commission's report. It is to engage ourselves in consultation with all sections of the sugar industry, not just with the canegrowers, to establish a task force for that purpose, and to develop a strategy which enables the sugar industry in this country to grow, and not introduce a strategy that decimates it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies would decimate the sugar industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales. They would do it because the coalition is committed to a zero level of tariff. It is driven by an ideological commitment to achieve zero regardless of the circumstances and it takes no account of the particular circumstances affecting the sugar industry, such as the recent decision in the US to lower the tariff quota of entry into that country. Little wonder that State-wide on Channel 7 in Queensland yesterday the reporter said of Mr Bonanno, the Chairman of the Cane Growers Council in Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Bonanno says he doesn't see the Opposition as boosting the trade opportunities in the wake of the potentially disastrous trade situation, even Opposition Leader, John Hewson is refusing to budge on his zero tariff policy.</PARA>
<PARA>This is despite what the National Party has been saying. Mr Bonanno went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they were being anything like electorally pragmatic, they'd be looking at their policy because the policy certainly doesn't suit our industry one bit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said when the Leader of the Opposition went north the other day to try to appease the recalcitrant canegrowers, believing that he could convince them that this great Fightback package was in their interests. That was the response of the canegrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, we had the circumstance of Mr Bob Katter, a hopeful for the National Party in the forthcoming Federal election, organising a rebel group to get the National Party to change, not Dr Hewson. He is not even listening to this now, Mr Acting Speaker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition is not listening. It is little wonder that the people in the seats of Kennedy and Herbert cannot see any support for them in his policies. What did he do when Mr Katter tried to organise this group of rebels to get those opposite to change policy? He dismissed them; he slapped them down. He was not prepared to listen to anything that they had to put forward and he then developed, as the Prime Minister has just indicated, the smokescreen to get him out of the difficulties confronting him with respect to the sugar growers in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He developed this strategy of opening up a special trade arrangement with the US which we saw the Leader of the National Party defend not so ably last night. I agree entirely with the Prime Minister's assertion that the performance was incompetent; it was. He was not able to answer one question. Yet this was the smokescreen to get them off the problem which confronted them with the coalition's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Leader of the Opposition who has caused concern; it is the shadow Minister for industry as well. Last week in an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> he was asked about the employment consequences flowing from the coalition tariff policy. The following question was put to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what do the people who work in these industries do when we let them go and their place is taken by their equivalents from overseas that operate in protected markets?</PARA>
<PARA>Do you know how the honourable member for Barker responded? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they changed the corn laws in England in the middle of the 19th century they took the tariffs off, doubled the size of manufacturing and wages doubled in 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it, Mr Acting Speaker. The genesis of Fightback's industry policy is finally revealed: it is nineteenth century England and it is the corn laws. That will be great news for the sugar growers in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the only time warp in which those on the other side operate. Look at the decisions of moment that were taken at the National Party conference last weekend. There was a decision whereby they voted to reintroduce knighthoods. Again, that will be great news for the sugar industry in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the hopeful Sir Timothy of Farrer and his friend sitting next to him, Lord Bruce of Murray, go and tell the people of Townsville and Ingham that the honourable member for Barker says, `It's all very well; wrecking the sugar industry is fine. You've only got to look at nineteenth century England to understand why'. The fact of the matter is that our position on industry development stands in stark contrast to that of the other side of this House. Our approach is one whereby we will consult with industry, we will take account of the special circumstances affecting that industry and we will develop a position that will expand that industry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gulf between the ideology on the other side of the House and the reality on this side is the reason the sugar industry is turning away from the Opposition in droves. It is the reason other rural industries will also turn away. The Opposition will have nothing for them in the future because it relates to the past. It is in that context that the National Party has been sold a pup in Fightback. The sugar growers of Queensland understand it, and in the coming months other grower groups will understand it. I offer a challenge to the Leader of the National Party: between now and the next election I would like to see him on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> talking as confidently on tariffs as he did on trade last night!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally refute the Opposition's recent statements on trade policy matters. It is of concern to me, as it should be to all people in this country, particularly those associated with agriculture, that not only do we have such contradictory statements made by both the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Hewson), but they also insult our most important trading partner, Japan, with which we have a total trade of $23.7 billion and a surplus in our favour of $6 billion. Most importantly, I would like to make a factual point: the Government has taken up this matter with the President of the United States in a responsible and sensible manner, not in a doorstop outside Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that Australian trade policy is not, and never has been, a single track policy. It is a policy with three mutually supportive arms: regional, bilateral and multilateral. The multilateral trade system establishes the rules and framework under which bilateral trade relations and regional trade policy take place. Multilateral, bilateral and regional trade policies are not alternatives; they are essential and complementary elements of a total trade policy. Such a multifaceted trade policy is particularly important for smaller trading nations, such as Australia, which do not have the political or economic muscle of the world's largest economies. I do not think the Opposition realises that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Opposition decided to slip into Japan, which has repercussions in Asia, I do not think it recognised that we have a surplus of $2.8 billion with the Asian nations and a surplus of $7.5 billion in the Asia-Pacific basin. National Party members should recognise that we export $6.3 billion worth of processed and semi-processed food products into Asia, and that figure is growing at something like 8 per cent per annum. To attack Japan is irresponsible and downright stupid. </PARA>

At the same time the Leader of the National Party has said that the United States is Australia's No. 1 enemy and the Leader of the Liberal Party has suggested that we should join NAFTA. As has been said at Question Time today, there is no agricultural benefit for us in joining NAFTA, but there is a benefit if we want to get cheap cars from Mexico. I am quite sure that the manufacturers in Victoria would be thrilled about the Mexican connection. I think they would be thrilled to go along and talk to the Chilean Government, which we all know has been a leader in things such as world affairs and human rights in the last few years, and ask what it thinks about our gaining access to trade.

<PARA>This is the right angle, triangle thing that the Leader of the National Party was trying to work out. The article stated that aviation rights should not be linked to the wheat issue. It said that this would have a severe effect on one of our most important industries; that is, the tourist industry, which is worth something like $25 billion a year. The deputy director of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Philip Eliason, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . joining NAFTA would divert attention from Asia and bring up `technical and legal questions' about Australia's special relationship with Japan and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, no-one is taking any notice of the Opposition's statements on trade, and nor should they. What it did in Question Time today was designed to take pressure off the division between the Liberal and National parties and to appease people in the National Party. It attempted to put up a smokescreen against those in the National Party who are very concerned about zero tariffs, Fightback and a goods and services tax on their farm produce. Anyone in the domestic market who would welcome a tax of 15 per cent on their farm produce needs to see a psychiatrist. Regarding wheat, here is another great statement by the Leader of the Liberal Party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, the easiest way is to quantify what this is worth&mdash;this one change is worth to our economy and particularly to our wheat growers, and seek at least equivalent offset access to some other areas. Maybe you can get access for beef or sugar if you can't get the access for wheat.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, wheat misses out, and they will try to get access for sugar. The fact is that sugar is set on quotas. We have all seen that quota go down. Our best chance to see an improvement is through the GATT round with a lot of hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at not only the total confusion but also the irresponsibility of the Opposition, we find that it must be a laughing stock in the world in terms of what it has said about sugar. The Leader of the Opposition is behaving in a very similar way to an American politician in the 1960s. In the 1960s America had a politician called Barry Goldwater. He wanted to bomb all those who disagreed with the United States. He wanted to bomb Russia and he wanted to bomb the commies all over the world. He was so right wing that he frightened the Republicans into not voting for him in the 1964 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in Australia is a leader of the Liberal Party who wants to scorch the earth and napalm everything. The Liberals want a domestic economy in which young people are paid $3 an hour. They want them to be put into McDonald's so there can be a cheap labour market. The Liberals would kick the daylights out of workers; they would abolish leave loading and penalty rates; they would get rid of the minimum wage and they would bring in voluntary agreements. They would have zero tariffs across all industries. When it comes to world affairs, where it really counts, because we live in a trading nation&mdash;we export the majority of our products and we will have to continue to do so&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition decided not only to slip into the United States but also he thinks that it will accept our joining NAFTA when we know there will not be any direct benefit in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have considered joining NAFTA, as the Opposition Leader has said. After very careful consideration over the years, we have decided not to join NAFTA. The Opposition Leader certainly does not see the validity of not joining NAFTA but, at the same time, he decided to slip into Asia, in particular Japan&mdash;the country that buys our coal, wheat and sugar. It buys our products and will continue to be a growing market as more liberalised trade comes through. And it is coming through. One only needs to talk to beef producers to find that out. I quote one of the interesting comments on sugar by the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think that you're seeing an increasing number of people in the sugar industry concede that Fightback! is overwhelmingly beneficial to the industry. . . . And as Tim Fischer has been out there saying this morning&mdash;I think he was at the Mossman Sugar Mill the other day&mdash;they've conceded the point, that the package is to their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently, at a very lengthy meeting at Mossman in the heart of far-north Queensland sugar country&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is actually right at the top end&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Chairman of that mill came out at the end of the meeting publicly, and said Fightback is exactly the right way to go. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the way to go. Table 4.1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document states, at page 34:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural and manufacturing assistance (IC) . . . Elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>It is going to be a scorched earth. But let us see what was said by Joe Farley, general manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association. A heading today is `Tariff cuts "folly"&mdash;Trade policy under attack'. Joe Farley is not very rapt in zero tariffs. What did Brian McDonald, head of the New South Wales Cane Growers Association, say? An article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's special Sugar Industry Taskforce is likely to reject an Industry Commission recommendation to abolish sugar tariffs, according to. . . Brian McDonald.</PARA>
<PARA>He is not really rapt in zero tariffs either. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said today at Question Time, Harry Bonnano said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were being anything like electorally pragmatic, they'd be looking at their policy because the policy certainly doesn't suit our industry one bit.</PARA>
<PARA>So the New South Wales Cane Growers Association, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Queensland canegrowers have all said that they are not rapt in Fightback, the GST or zero tariffs. But what do we have? We have the Opposition saying, `We have a great deal for you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have heard from the intellectual genius from North Queensland, Bob Katter, Jr. An article headed `Katter predicts splinter group will emerge over zero tariffs' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A National Party splinter group committed to fighting the Coalition's zero tariffs for the sugar industry would emerge after the Federal election, National candidate for Kennedy Bob Katter said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>I would just like to quote from an interview that this great intellectual genius did with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yeh, I can't understand the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson in attacking me. I mean I didn't put in countervailing sanctions in his "Fightback" Package presumably he did and if countervailing sanctions, if that term has any meaning at all, it means if somebody does something to you, then you sanction them back.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say at the end&mdash;this is beautiful:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now I wouldn't see that as any conflict with the Coalition Policies because countervailing sanctions are most certainly in there, I read the document myself and I saw them there and underlined them.</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), put out a media release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many Queenslanders failed to understand that the Coalition's new anti-dumping laws would be more powerful in keeping dumped sugar out of Australia than tariffs could ever be.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that tariffs mean nothing to the European Community, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that there is a big difference between tariffs to keep a product out and tariffs as a price support. Every cane farmer right across Australia&mdash;and even, surprisingly, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who has been running around saying what tariff cuts are doing to his electorate&mdash;realises that tariffs are actually a price support mechanism, and they are worth at the moment $55 a tonne for the domestic market. </PARA>

Unfortunately, that is not correct either. Any significant impact is enough. For example, complaints have been made and anti-dumping duties applied when imports were only 7 per cent of the market. But this is not the real point. What is vital is that anti-dumping dues can be applied even if there is negligible loss of market share if other effects, such as a fall in price for local goods, et cetera, are significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Deputy Leader of the National Party said that it took 15 months to get action in the recent tomato case. That is wrong again.

What a pathetic endeavour on the part of the backbench of the Labor Party. Did honourable members read the terms of the MPI? It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The urgent need for the Government to refute the Opposition's recent statements. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a cry from the heart of a backbencher calling on his Party to refute the arguments that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others have been putting ever since the United States expanded its export enhancement program. It brought about a whimper from this Government and an attack from the Opposition, which said, `You should be doing more to stand up for Australia's interests'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows the reference of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Parliament at Question Time today when he could not even get the name of NAFTA right. Probably nothing more encapsulated in a moment the Government's single-track mentality of dealing with trade matters only through the GATT and not looking beyond that at all. Behind this very weak response by the Government to something that strikes at the heart of wheat growers today has been this supine approach of the Government, and we ask why? Has it called in the United States Ambassador or the charge d'affaires and protested? I am not aware that it has been done. There has been a singular response, which has been to use the mechanisms of GATT and protest through GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in favour of that, but we have a long-held concern that the GATT is not effective enough. We will work extremely hard in the GATT, but in making this protest through the GATT what did the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), say about the processes last week? The Acting Minister, that aptly named member of the Parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current provisions of the GATT on export subsidies are inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>The current provisions of the GATT on export subsidies are inadequate, yet we will put all our eggs in the GATT basket and not whine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the singular response, and the Government has had an obsession almost with multilateralism. It works through Australia's trade problems through the GATT, through the multilateral round alone, and decries us when we say, `Look, there is a possibility of a multifaceted, multi-track approach on trade which you ought to be pursuing in the nation's interest'. A little old fashioned consideration of what is in the broad national good would not be a bad idea, but an almost obsessive, ideological bent on multilateralism alone is what has driven the Government in this arena&mdash;GATT and GATT alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said, `Use the GATT forums by all means. Press for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round, but conduct bilateral trade negotiations as well. Push for Australia's interests through the regional trade arrangements that we have been talking about'. But, no. Then when we got this enhanced approach by the President of the United States last week under EEP, the Government rested on the GATT alone. At a time when the Prime Minister should have been contacting the President direct, either by correspondence or by phone, and should have been calling in either the Ambassador or, if he was not here, the charge d'affaires, to register the strongest protest on behalf of Australia's interests, we heard not a whimper in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Leader of the Opposition who did the most plausible thing. He wrote a plausible letter in which he directly addressed the undertaking that had been given by the President when he was here in January. President Bush said on that occasion that his administration would seek in implementing the export enhancement program to `minimise the effect on Australia'. The Leader of the Opposition reasonably said that, in line with that undertaking of the President, we would like to see urgent negotiations between our two governments to minimise the impact of EEP sales on Australia's long term commercial relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said secondly that, while we are about it, we should address the issue of the impact which the EEP decision will have on Australia's export earnings, and we could look for offsets in other areas. He listed the access provided to the American market for a wide range of Australian products which were the subject, and are the subject, of bilateral and global quotas. The Leader of the Opposition said, `Let us talk about those as well'. He prefaced his third point by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a longer term proposal our two Governments need to address the general issue of trade access to the American market and to the wider market that has been created by the North American Free Trade Area. I believe that there are significant mutual advantages to be gained from greater Australian involvement with, and eventual membership of, NAFTA and that our two Governments should be addressing this issue directly.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the Leader of the Opposition who was putting plausible arguments to meet the present concern, to widen it into access to the American market generally and to discuss the then even wider perspective over the long term of NAFTA, and preparedness to discuss eventual membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government thinks this is a most radical proposition. The Leader of the Opposition, like all of us, knows that NAFTA may not get off the ground; it has a pretty tortuous road ahead of it. But it is there in this formative stage for discussion by allies, by trading partners and by friends as to where we could go with NAFTA itself. I would like to say that we were the genesis of this idea, but do honourable members know where it was also discussed?

At the bottom of one of them was an interesting remark by a person whom the Labor Government has held up as its quintessential trade consultant and expert: Mr Alan Oxley, a good supporter of the Labor Government, ambassador to the Tokyo round of the GATT. He was quoted as saying that Australia should seek to negotiate an agreement into NAFTA&mdash;right up to date. So there we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no, not this Government because it sticks solely to multilateralism as a trade approach and as a trade policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the level of attention directed to the Uruguay Round by Australia has been commendable but has had a slight air of unreality about it as it has turned out.</PARA>

<PARA>That is precisely what we have been saying. The Government's own senior Ministers who have been Ministers for trade, including the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce&mdash;save and except for the one at the table, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin)&mdash;have pushed for negotiations outside the multilateral round because they have known the benefits that are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when addressing a conference I said, `The percentage of our exports has gone up but they just followed in the slipstream of Asian development'. That is all they have  done. Let me show those opposite the need for them to give urgent attention to bilateral agreements. Let us look at market share, which is the only test on whether the Government is improving its position in Asia or not. This is the region to which we address the highest priority. It is not beyond the wit of man to chew gum and walk at the same time. Therefore, a government can negotiate with the United States and in Asia as well as participate in the GATT Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for work beyond the meanderings of the current Minister, namely to negotiate agreements and push for greater access, is borne out by these figures.

He even ruled out the Opposition's previous policy view about there being no connection between matters military and trade. It was an absolutely pathetic performance by the Leader of the Opposition. He did not show in any way, sense or form that he understood trade in principle or in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) ought to realise one thing. There are not many countries willing to deal bilaterally when the multilateral negotiations are so nearly in place. Why would any country deal with the Liberal and National parties?  If they stripped this country of all tariffs, what would they have to offer?  What do we have to offer any other multilateral round?  Doug Anthony went to the last round, came back and said, `I didn't have to give away anything'. He did not have to give away any tariffs and he kept our ossified manufacturing industry structure. The greatest enemy of the farmers in Australia all through those years was the National Party because it kept up high manufacturing tariffs. It could never negotiate. It never had the wit to put agriculture into the multilateral round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only place where the Opposition can get credit for tariffs cuts already is in the GATT negotiations. I would like to point out that there is a clear connection between GATT multilateral negotiations and bilateral negotiations. If one gets cover under the umbrella, if one gets comprehensive tariffication&mdash;that is, all measures of protection expressed as tariffs&mdash;then one gets the real world of non-tariff barriers wiped out in one fell swoop. This makes it so much easier to get bilateral trade negotiations under way.

He announces an export enhancement total initiative for the year to come rather than individual EEP initiatives. He writes to our Prime Minister. We say, `Not good enough' and immediately, in a well judged and appropriate response, we say that we are going to GATT. Today I was speaking with the Canadian Minister who is in NAFTA and who is just as affronted and hurt by the EEP as we are.

When there were problems with wheat and meat access to Taiwan, the Government did nothing. Full credit must go to the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. What about air links which should have been in place by the mid-1980s?

It is also reflected in the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not consider that Asia was worth visiting for a long time and the Asians knew that very well. I again remind those opposite of the loss of markets in the Middle East. We offered on a bipartisan basis, with no politics, to have the last person in Australia who had any real rapport with the Middle East&mdash;that is, Doug Anthony, when he was the Minister for Trade&mdash;go back and negotiate that access again, but the Government could not take it. </PARA>

We talk about Japan and fair trade, but why is there a complete embargo on any rice going from Australia to Japan and, for that matter, Korea? What has the Government done about that?

It was only a question of when that announcement would be made. Our political intelligence through this Government in Washington has been absolutely dreadful. Public warnings should have been made, and pressure should have been maintained since President Bush's visit to prevent the Americans from taking those actions or at least to protect as much as possible Australia's interest. What happened? We had 1 1/2 hour's notice of the United States' decision. What has happened since? We wrote a letter back to the President of the United States after he told us.

At a time when the United States has already increased its market share, it is increasingly using its dairy export incentive program or subsidy program, which is now up to $70m a year&mdash;he is strangely silent. My advice is that he did not raise these issues. He certainly did not make any comments publicly in the United States, and neither has he made any since he has returned, on the EEP&mdash;which he must have known was going to be extended&mdash;on fruit, dairy or any other such matter.

It reduced meat access halfway through the year. Fruit and dairy exports with export subsidy competition are now weaker.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill is supposedly designed to refund sales tax paid on swimming pools constructed in situ since they were made taxable under the wholesale sales tax laws in 1986. The 1986 legislation implementing the new tax deemed that a concrete pool constructed on site was a good for the purpose of the sales tax law and imposed a complicated set of artificial deeming provisions by which the sales tax value for the pool was to be calculated and the tax collected. These provisions were extremely complex and difficult to apply in practice. Numerous errors were made in either overpaying or underpaying the tax, and there was also widespread avoidance of the tax, taking advantage of a loophole whereby owner builders were not obliged to pay the tax. This led to a remarkable proliferation in the number of owner builders at the expense of legitimate pool builders who paid the tax and lost business as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia obtained legal advice that the 1986 tax was constitutionally invalid, and subsequently launched a challenge to its validity in the High Court. In February of this year the High Court handed down its decision in what became the Mutual Pools case. In that decision the Court ruled that the 1986 amendments to the sales tax legislation did not conform with a requirement in section 55 of the Constitution that laws imposing duties of excise deal with duties of excise only. The tax was thus found to be constitutionally invalid and was said by the High Court never to have legally come into effect. That is very important to remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last month's Budget, the Government announced that it will be introducing new legislation to impose a 20 per cent sales tax on swimming pool shells constructed in situ to replace the previous sales tax arrangements ruled unconstitutional by the High Court. The new legislation will be designed to ensure the neutral taxation treatment of different types of swimming pools and, we understand, will be introduced prospectively in the coming months. It is to be hoped that the new tax will be a substantial improvement on the old, although obviously a better solution would be to scrap the wholesale sales tax system in its entirety, as the coalition has advocated for some time now. This would eliminate the need to fiddle constantly with the wholesale sales tax system, as this Government so often does, in order to eliminate inequities that inevitably emerge with the various sales taxes. In the meantime, however, the Government is faced with the task of refunding some 10,000 swimming pool owners with a constitutionally invalid impost that was paid on swimming pools built between 1986 and early 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Swimming Pool and Spa Association claims that its members are entitled to a refund of $8m, paid under an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office, plus $2m in interest, and that its members paid $20m to the ATO from 1986 to mid-1990 when the agreement with the ATO was entered into. Millions of dollars in sales tax were also collected from non-Association members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the High Court challenge was in progress the Swimming Pool and Spa Association advised its members to stop making payments to the Tax Office and to pay those moneys instead into a trust fund. The fund was designed to protect members against the possibility that the High Court challenge might fail and that the builders would have to pay the outstanding tax to the ATO, in which case the payments could be met out of the trust fund. On the other hand, if the High Court challenge was successful the funds could then be returned to Association members, undoubtedly on better terms than those likely to be provided by the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Office agreed to this arrangement for about three months, before changing its mind and demanding that payments be resumed by way of monthly returns. The Association's accountants, Ernst and Young, and the Tax Office then entered into an agreement whereby pool builders would resume making payments to the Tax Office, including the funds accumulated in the trust fund. But these funds were to be fully refundable if the Tax Office lost the High Court case, plus interest at the rate applicable to overpaid tax. It was on the basis of this agreement that pool builders resumed making payments to the ATO for the illegal tax and handed over the money that the Association was holding for pool builders in the trust fund. This agreement is well documented in an exchange of letters dated November 1990 between Ernst and Young and the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the effects of the High Court decision is that pool builders who were able to pass on the sales tax impost to their customers in the form of higher prices for swimming pools would in theory be able to get the benefit of the refund from the Commonwealth as a windfall gain. The Bill before us is supposedly designed to ensure that any refunds paid by the Commonwealth go to those people who actually bore the tax, rather than to the builders who may have paid the tax to the Commonwealth but who may have then passed it on to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is meant to impose a condition on the eligibility of the pool builder to a refund by requiring that where the sales tax impost was passed on to the customer the refund must also be passed on. The Bill also provides that pool builders be paid interest for the period that they are out of pocket, following the High Court decision and this legislation, although it contains no such consideration for pool owners and does not even begin to repay the cost incurred by pool builders as a result of their legal ordeal with the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the idea of refunding pool owners and builders for payments that they have made to the Tax Office under what turned out to be an illegal sales tax impost. Unfortunately, this Bill does not even begin to bring about that result; in fact, it achieves the very opposite outcome by enabling the Tax Office to keep the money, including the trust fund moneys handed over by the Association. Furthermore, it would appear that this has been the intention of the Government and the ATO all along. Ever since the High Court decision there has been considerable confusion about the mechanism by which the Government would be able to refund swimming pool owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March this year the Commissioner of Taxation issued a press release in which he referred to some of these difficulties. He said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision has raised a range of complex legal issues surrounding the questions of how, and under what conditions, money which has been paid as sales tax by professional and private pool builders can be refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues must be clarified before any decision on the payment of refunds can be made.</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation is supposedly designed to resolve these complex legal issues. In fact, the Bill does not even attempt to address the problems created by the High Court decision. Since that press release was issued, we have seen the emergence of what has become known in business circles as the bottom of the pool scandal, as the Tax Office has sought to misappropriate funds that rightfully belong to those swimming pool owners and builders who ultimately bore the tax. David Koch, money guide writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, has aptly described this bottom of the pool scandal as `an intriguing litany of secret deals and fights'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this Bill is that the Commonwealth is only liable to make a refund of tax paid if the Commissioner of Taxation receives a declaration from the pool builder that the amount paid was not passed on to the pool purchaser or, if an amount was passed on, that amount has been refunded to the pool purchaser. The Bill allows for declarations to be lodged up to one year after the Bill receives royal assent. The obvious problem with the Bill, however, is that it relies on the pool builders to make the necessary declaration, something which they have absolutely no incentive to do. The pool builders must sign a declaration, subject to severe penalties for misstatements, that either no tax was passed on or that sales tax has been refunded to the owner if the pool builder is to get a refund. But most pools have been installed under lump sum contracts which do not make separate provision for, or identify, a sales tax figure. Pool building has been a very competitive industry, made even more so due to the widespread tax avoidance that took place under the illegal sales tax impost of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many pool builders wore the tax themselves out of their profit margins rather than passing it on to consumers, or only passed it on in part, so there is often no accounting for sales tax either paid or not paid by the pool builder. There is also no incentive for the pool builder to make such a declaration, since the total value of any refund goes to another party, namely, the pool owner. There is no compensation to the builder for the time and expense involved in preparing and lodging such declarations, processing the refunds and substantiating claims in the event of an audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pool builder would presumably have to borrow at commercial rates in order to refund a pool owner and then obtain the refunded money from the Tax Office, something which just does not make business sense when the Tax Office is only paying around 14 per cent interest on overpaid tax. The Bill leaves pool owners who may have borne tax without any recourse if the pool owner refuses to process a declaration which, as I have made clear, the builder does not have an incentive to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also recourse for the pool owner if the pool builder has since gone out of business, which many pool builders have done, due to the effects of the recession we `had to have' on a fiercely competitive industry. For these pool owners it will be impossible to obtain a refund, even if pool builders were willing to process the declaration. But of far greater importance than the lack of incentive for the builder to process refunds is the fact that the Bill serves to nullify the agreement between the Swimming Pool and Spa Association and the Tax Office for the refund of moneys collected illegally by the Tax Office. This is to nullify an agreement. While this is not expressly provided for in the Bill, I might add, it is the effect of the drafting of clauses 4(1) and 6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill reflects the fact that the ATO has ratted on an agreement with the Association, so the Bill retrospectively deprives builders of their rights under that agreement to a refund of moneys illegally collected by the Tax Office. Not only is this a great injustice to the pool builders, who handed over the money in good faith to the Australian Taxation Office, but it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent for the administration of taxation law in this country. Agreements between the ATO and taxpayers are an important part of the functioning of the Australian taxation system. They are a regular feature of relations between taxpayers and the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Bill is allowed to nullify the agreement between the Tax Office and the Association, it will be the first time that the ATO has reneged on such a major agreement with a group of taxpayers. If this legislation is enacted as drafted, taxpayers will never again be able to trust a Tax Office agreement, to the great detriment of the administration of taxation law in this country. If businesses cannot trust the Tax Office to live up to agreements that it has made with them freely and as taxpayers, then they have little choice but to pay tax on demand and possibly go out of business as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there is no hint of any of this in the Bill or in the second reading speech, but the explanatory memorandum gives the game away when the financial impact statement notes that there may be a positive revenue impact as a result of the Bill. How is that? The Government is going to pay out taxes illegally collected, but there will be a positive revenue impact. That is a fairly remarkable outcome, even for this Government, with a Bill that is meant to be refunding tax payments illegally collected rather than collecting tax. In fact, the Bill is designed to do nothing more than defraud taxpayers of money that is rightfully theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality behind this Bill was admirably described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by David Koch when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the Treasurer and the Tax Office have pulled a swifty on everyone. They have broken an agreement with the builders, won political points for giving the refund to the owners but made it so hard to claim that the Tax Office will end up keeping the money.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a measure of the lack of integrity with which the Australian taxation system is administered by this Government. It also represents yet another instalment in this Government's continued maladministration of the wholesale sales tax system in this country. The wholesale sales tax is a distortionary, inequitable and destructive tax at the best of times. But the inherent destructiveness of this tax is greatly compounded when the tax is abused and manipulated for political ends in the manner favoured by this Government. Such abuses create uncertainty on the part of taxpayers, which serves to amplify the already horrendous compliance and collection costs associated with this iniquitous tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes it is essential that the Swimming Pool and Spa Association agreement with the Australian Taxation Office be removed from the ambit of the Bill, and that the Bill as a whole should be amended to enable refunds of tax to be paid to pool purchasers who bore sales tax as a result of the 1986 legislation. I foreshadow moving amendments to this effect in the committee stage. If this House is unwilling to make the necessary amendments then the coalition will seek to refer the Bill to a Senate committee to receive the scrutiny it deserves. The coalition will then re-evaluate the Bill in the light of the Senate committee's reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. This encapsulates a proposal which seeks to remove the sales tax exemption that has been made available to certain recycled paper products. It is proposed that goods made of wholly recycled fibre will become taxable under the wholesale sales tax system. These goods include books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing, and tissues and paper bags of various types. Products that will remain sales tax exempt include writing and drawing paper, pads of such paper, paper used in accounting ledgers and journals, and envelopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original sales tax exemption dates back to the Government's environment statement of 20 July 1989, as a result of which legislation was introduced to exempt from sales tax goods that were made out of wholly recycled paper. This was part of the Richardson factor which gripped Australian politics at that time, whereby Government policy was held hostage to a whole range of bogus environmental initiatives. The measures in that statement had a pre-election sound to them and these exemptions, of course, were no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then new exemptions were not alone in this regard, however. In the course of the subsequent election campaign in 1990 the Government announced an increase in the sales tax on luxury vehicles, a measure which was designed to win votes for the Labor Party and exploit the politics of envy. The subsequent sales tax hike devastated the so-called luxury car industry in Australia until it was inevitably repealed just a year later. So it would seem that the sales tax exemption for recycled paper products is set to join the luxury car tax as yet another politically motivated abuse of the sales tax system that is to be abandoned now that the Government no longer has any use for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of its introduction the coalition criticised the exemption as being essentially unworkable. My colleague Senator Watson made a number of criticisms of the drafting of the legislation. Those criticisms were subsequently proved to be valid and are supplemented by several Industry Commission reports that looked into the matter. In report No. 2 of 1990 the Commission concluded that the existing legislation was distorting and failed to encourage efficient paper recycling. There is simply no way of ensuring that paper which it is claimed is produced from 100 per cent recycled fibre is in fact so constituted. This is particularly true of imported paper products, which has given the imported product a potential advantage over domestically produced material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an anomaly in the existing definition of recycled paper which allows paper made from all virgin fibres to be defined as recycled paper because of the normal breaking down processes used in paper manufacturing. The Industry Commission's report No. 6 of 1991 on recycling in general concluded that the sales tax exemption for recycled paper products should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be something of an understatement to say that the various paper manufacturers are divided on the issue of whether to maintain the exemption. Some businesses have made investment plans on the basis of the exemption, while others have made similar investments in the strangely prophetic belief that the exemption would eventually be abolished. It has been rather disturbing to see the extent to which some commercial interests will attack and malign other producers in order to get what they want, rather than arguing the facts of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been keen to avoid an either-or outcome on this issue. Clearly, some paper manufacturers will be disadvantaged by this legislation. They are having the goalposts shifted on them midway through the play, as it were. On the other hand some manufacturers are being disadvantaged by the existing arrangements, which are in any case highly distortionary and should be removed even if for no other reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole issue has been a classic example of the distortions and the uncertainties generated by this Government's chopping and changing of the wholesale sales tax system. It is the Government's responsibility to provide certainty and predictability in all areas of the law, including tax law. Indeed, that is a fundamental tenet of the rule of law. If the Government chops and changes the law with no warning, as it is doing with this legislation, then Australians no longer have the benefit of the protection that the law should offer. Instead they are vulnerable to the whim of the government of the day in their business affairs and in their personal lives. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firms that will be disadvantaged by this legislation recognise the difficulties caused by the exemption. Their argument, however, does not concern the merits of the exemption one way or another for the purpose of this debate. The issue is one of ensuring that Australian firms have a stable and predictable business environment in which to operate. To illustrate this point, I will quote what Mr John Pedler, a director of Austissue, had to say to the Senate Select Committee dealing with this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, we are saying that it is the Government's right and duty to set an appropriate framework for business people to take their risks or choose not to take their risks, whatever the case may be. The Government set a framework. We set off in a particular direction, dictated by that framework and all of a sudden one day we woke up and found that yesterday someone had changed the rules.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what happened to Austissue and other businesses like it: one day they were beneficiaries of recently legislated exemptions to the sales taxes law; the next day they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of this legislation is that it is essentially retrospective in effect. It applied from the day following the introduction of the legislation, so that prices for the relevant products began to increase virtually overnight. The companies adversely affected by this Bill have already lost market share, and yet the Bill has not even been debated yet by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things about this particular issue is that the coalition will provide no such exemption to recycled products in our proposed goods and services tax. Interestingly enough, the firms affected do not have a major problem with this. Our goods and services tax proposal has the potential to have a detrimental impact on some firms in the industry in the same way as the removal of the sales tax exemption, although there are, of course, many offsetting benefits in our Fightback package for Australian business which distinguishes our proposal from the effect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the Government and the coalition on this matter is that people involved in recycled paper manufacturing have known about the coalition's intentions for nearly a year now. They would have until 1994 to change their business practices to allow for the loss of this particular tax advantage relative to other paper products. This was borne out in evidence given by Mr Pedler before the Senate Select Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our organisation also does not have a problem with somebody changing the rules, but giving us some time to do that. In 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think he meant 1994&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is going to be taxable; between now and then it is going to have a scaled entry. We can react to that, but suddenly to have somebody drop on one day information that we were not consulted about but had heard through the retail and commercial trades that legislation was being brought down to reintroduce the sales tax causes us a high degree of concern.</PARA>
<PARA>So the damage, if any, the coalition might have inflicted on this particular industry will be minimised by the fact that these businesses will have had time to adjust to the implication of our proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the past few days, these businesses were getting no such consideration from the Government. The Government announced this change to the wholesale sales tax system virtually with the introduction of this legislation, unless one considers Industry Commission reports to accurately signal the Government's future legislative intention. If that were true, the Australian economy would be in a much better shape than it is today, but it is not true, unfortunately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firms affected have had no time to adjust to the proposed new sales tax environment. It should also be noted that we recognise that the failure to remove this exemption may perpetuate an ongoing disadvantage to some other larger paper manufacturers in Australia. But the issue is really about whether the firms disadvantaged by this proposal will receive some form of compensation for having had the rules changed on them virtually overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government now acknowledges that the exemption it introduced back in 1989 failed to fulfil its stated purpose. The Fightback proposals&mdash;the coalition's proposal to abolish wholesale sales tax and replace it and other taxes with a uniform goods and services tax&mdash;would also have the effect as at 1 October 1994 of removing the exemption. In the coalition's initial consideration of this Bill, we were concerned that a number of companies had relied on the exemption in making investment and management decisions. For them, the Government's withdrawal of the exemption without giving those companies any time to adjust is unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to indications that the coalition may oppose the legislation for this reason, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) approached the coalition, suggesting that the Government could meet concerns through a special purpose payment to the relevant State government for passing on to the producer, equal to the estimated wholesale sales tax paid on the product of the producer for the year ended 30 June 1992. I believe the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), in summing up the debate on the second reading later on, will provide greater detail of the implementation of the Government's proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the coalition has today decided to go along with its proposition and not to oppose the Bill. However, the Government must recognise its responsibility to compensate businesses that it disadvantages through arbitrary changes to the law. Otherwise, we will live in a lawless society with no protection for the individual against the power of the state and no compensation for property unjustly seized by Government edict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would have liked to correct some misleading statements put out by some of the lobbyists in this connection, but I simply want to say that this Government's handling of the sales tax system has been a disaster from start to finish and that disaster continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a few comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I will try to follow the basic structure which he had in his own speech whereby he addressed the proposed legislation on sales tax on swimming pools and then went on to provide us with the views of himself and the Opposition on the proposed amendment to sales tax on recycled paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to go back to the very beginning of this whole long story and remember that prior to 1986 if someone were building an in-ground swimming pool, he paid no sales tax. If someone were building a swimming pool above the ground, he paid 10 per cent in sales tax, so we had a ridiculous situation where often the cheaper pools which were being installed in working-class electorates in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne were getting taxed at 10 per cent whereas the in-ground, beautifully built sandstone swimming pools at Bellevue Hill and other places in the exclusive parts of Sydney and Melbourne were exempt from any sales tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, I think rightly, tried to rationalise this and introduced a 20 per cent sales tax on all swimming pools, whether they were above the ground or below the ground. I think that made a great deal of sense. However, we have since learnt that the High Court of Australia had a different interpretation of the amendments which this Parliament carried and, in February this year, it ruled against the sales tax legislation amendments which had been introduced in the Parliament. The question which this legislation addresses today is how we go about ensuring that as many pool owners as possible, and as many builders as possible, who have paid their sales tax and are entitled to a refund, do in fact get that refund in a proper and fair manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the point made by the honourable member for Curtin that there will be some people who may not receive a refund because a number of pool builders have gone out of business. But the difficulty is in asking what alternative the honourable member for Curtin can offer which will provide those people with the refund that he thinks they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having heard the honourable member's comments, I find it difficult to see how his alternative would provide those people with the rebate which I think he believes they should receive. The honourable member seemed to be arguing that what should happen is that pool builders en masse should be receiving these cheques from the sales tax office. That is great for pool builders, but it does not always guarantee that the pool owner receives the rebate. That is what this legislation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation seeks to ensure that the builder does not get a refund from the Tax Office unless he ensures that the owner gets the refund first. If there is a time-lag between when builders pay pool owners their cheques and when the builders receive the refund from the Tax Office, we will compensate them with some interest. We are not in the business of helping one or two pool builders who might be sharks and who, I suspect, might be tempted not to pass on those sales tax rebates to the pool owners who had originally paid the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this legislation very correctly places a condition on the pool builders getting this rebate from the Tax Office. We say that they do not get that refund unless they can demonstrate that either they paid the tax and therefore are entitled to the refund, or that the pool owner paid the tax and the pool owner has received the rebate from the builder. That is very important because it ensures that people are not getting ripped off by the small number of unscrupulous pool builders in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin used some pretty serious words. He alleged that the Australian Taxation Office misappropriated funds of pool builders and pool owners. He used a very colourful expression from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and called this the `bottom of the pool scandal'. He went on to say that this system will not work because there is no incentive for the builders to sign the declarations or process the paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If pool builders think so little of their customers and clients that they are not prepared to fill out one declaration and send it off on their behalf, it does not say much at all about the ethics or the honesty of those pool builders. It is horrifying that the honourable member would suggest that some builders would not process a piece of paper that will give pool owners a tax rebate to which they are entitled unless the Government helps reimburse them for the cost of filling out these declarations. I think it is untenable that pool builders think so little of their customers and clients that they are not prepared to fill out these declarations. I think that says a lot about the Opposition's contempt for the ethics and honesty of people in the pool building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to admit that there are one or two sharks out there and probably one or two who will not be bothered to fill out the declarations on behalf of their customers. If any of those people are in my electorate, I will name them here in this Parliament, because I think those builders have made a profit out of my constituents who have had pools put in since 1986. If those builders are not prepared to fill out these declarations, if they are not prepared to meet their obligations to try to obtain these rebates for my constituents, I will get stuck into them here in this chamber. I hope that colleagues such as the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) will do the same for the small number of pool builders in their electorates who are sharks and that those honourable members will be prepared to make this small effort to ensure that their constituents receive the tax rebate to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a simple concept. Either the builder has paid the tax and therefore the builder puts in the form and gets his rebate, or the builder has passed the tax on to the pool owner. Once he gives the rebate to the pool owner, we will give the rebate to him. If there is a time gap between those two payments, we will even give him or her interest to cover the financing costs during that period. I think that is pretty fair. I am a bit disappointed that Opposition members are not prepared to go along with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having heard the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin, one gets the impression that Opposition members are saying that they want the Tax Office to be throwing around these tax rebate cheques like confetti to all the pool builders in the country, irrespective of whether the builders are passing on the rebates to the pool owners. I think it is quite legitimate for this Parliament and this House to be putting a condition on these payments that the pool builders are passing on the rebates to the pool owners where that is appropriate. </PARA>

We believe people should pay more sales tax on swimming pools and the luxuries of life than on the basic necessities such as food and clothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have a very different view of life. They say that people should pay 15 per cent on everything&mdash;15 per cent on bread and 15 per cent on milk. They say that people should pay consumption tax on clothing, council rates, garbage services, electricity bills and telephone bills. Opposition members say it is fairer to levy 15 per cent on everything. We say no, that is silly. It is much fairer to levy the luxury items in life, such as swimming pools, at 20 per cent and not to levy sales tax on bread and milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit disturbed that the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who is at the table, has not come out and said that he disagrees with his own Party's policy in not having any consumption tax on packages built for foreign holidays when the Opposition seeks to levy a 15 per cent consumption tax on holidays at Australian domestic destinations. That will be a 15 per cent disincentive to having a holiday in Australia. It will give an incentive to take a holiday in Fiji rather than in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that this legislation tries to ensure that if builders receive a refund they pass it on to the pool owners. I know that some people are saying, `It is unfair. Some pool builders have gone out of work and those pool owners won't receive their rebate'. We have tried to make this code the same as the existing refund code in section 26 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any alternative put up by the Opposition to hand out cheques willy-nilly to all pool builders still will not result in bankrupt pool builders getting a cheque from the Tax Office and being able to pass that on to the pool owners. It is quite misleading for the Opposition to suggest that there is an alternative. If a pool company has gone broke, how can the Tax Office give it a cheque which can be passed on to the pool owner? It is impossible. Honourable members know that this does not occur only with swimming pools. In other areas of the taxation system, if a company goes bankrupt it is a bit hard for the company to pass on a sales tax refund to someone else. It is ridiculous for those opposite to suggest that there is an alternative. As much as we would like to be able to pass on those rebates to the pool owners whose builders have gone broke, it is ridiculous and it would break all the precedents set in tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue which is considered in this legislation  is the Government's amendments to the sales tax concession which applies to recycled paper products. The honourable member for Curtin went to the trouble of describing our proposal in 1989 as a bogus environmental measure. He went on to say that the Opposition opposed it at the time, but if Fightback ever takes effect and the Opposition is elected to power there will be no incentive to use recycled products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is amending the concession for recycled paper products, but we are not proposing to abolish the concession completely. We are saying that the concession should apply to a number of products. We are saying that there should be a sales tax concession for people using recycled pads of writing and drawing paper, recycled paper used in accounting ledgers and journals, or envelopes made out of recycled paper. We want to encourage people to use recycled paper in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What this legislation does is remove the sales tax concession for a number of other products, such as facial tissues, toilet paper and household paper bags. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask why we have removed that concession. We have done so because it is a little hard to recycle toilet paper, whether it has been recycled or not originally. It is unusual to find people recycling tissue paper. Yet it is very common, even in this place, to recycle writing paper. We are encouraged to recycle the mountain of paper that comes across our desks when it is in a form that can be recycled. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are famous throughout the building for ensuring that where possible paper is recycled. We are talking about those products that can be recycled. We know that it is very difficult to recycle the other forms that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found that a number of companies are using the current concession for recycled tissue paper, toilet paper and household paper bags to import recycled pulp. By producing those products from that imported pulp and gaining the concession, they are gaining an advantage over an Australian produced alternative that otherwise may not be purchased by Australian consumers. I do not think that is sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been allegations that some importers are claiming the tax concession for products being recycled when they are not even recycled paper pulp. As the honourable member for Corangamite knows, it is very difficult to prove that something is a recycled product. In the distant past I seem to remember that he and a few others opposed the original tax concession because they thought it was difficult to prove the viability of providing a concession for recycled products. Those on this side of the House believe that we can still encourage people to purchase recycled writing paper, drawing paper and the other products that I have mentioned without allowing a few companies to manipulate the tax concession to cost Australians jobs, and that is what this legislation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Curtin accused the Government of being unreasonable for changing the rules after investment decisions had been made. He said that it is wrong for the Government to make arbitrary changes to the law. It is a bit hard for governments to make any decisions without being accused of making arbitrary and unreasonable decisions by those who lose out from those decisions. But ultimately it is this Parliament which has to be supreme in making decisions which it thinks are in the interests of the Australian people. If we say that we will never allow any decision in the future to disadvantage any company which has invested money in a factory anywhere in Australia it will be a recipe for never changing any laws in Australia at any time. That is a ridiculous concept. Of course governments have to change the rules when they think that circumstances have changed and when they think people are misusing the rules or abusing loopholes. That is why the Government has taken action in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, quite honestly, has declared that if Fightback is implemented, if there is a future change of government, there will be no wholesale sales tax on recycled products, or unrecycled products, which means that there will be no concession, no encouragement for people to use recycled products. The Opposition would do away with that concession. The Opposition says, `Don't worry about that. It will not come in until 1994, therefore business will not have to adjust very quickly'. If I invested money in a paper plant I would be hoping that my plant would operate for a few more than two years into 1994. I would be hoping that investment decisions which I would make about creating jobs for Australians in paper product plants would be going for decades and not simply two years, which appears to be the lifetime the Opposition is offering by saying that it will be at least 1994 before its decisions will take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to do two things: it seeks to ensure that where refunds are provided to pool builders for sales tax on in-ground swimming pools the builders do not get the money unless they can guarantee the money is flowing on to the pool owner. That is a right and proper thing to do. Secondly, we are seeking to ensure that the current concessional rate for recycled paper products is not abused. We will not allow importers to claim falsely that they are providing recycled paper products when in fact they are not. We are also seeking to ensure that where possible people continue to use recycled writing paper, drawing paper and other high quality recycled paper products. </PARA>

He put forward a very weak argument. As a member of the Government he is responsible for the legislation and for the debacle that has been created. Now they are doing their very best to get out of that difficulty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, which deals with recycling, comes about because of one of the Government's commitments to the Green movement. It is a long-standing commitment that the Hawke Government put forward when it tried to buy the Green movement vote. The Hawke Administration, in its environment statement of July 1989, promised to exempt from wholesale sales tax books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing, tissue and toilet paper and paper bags if they were made out of wholly recycled paper. The honourable member for Dobell alluded to the problem of definition regarding those items. In October 1994, after the election of a Hewson government, the present outmoded wholesale sales tax will be abolished. So the honourable member for Dobell will have no further problems. It will be replaced with an equitable goods and services tax of 15 per cent across the board. The sales tax system is a hopeless way to encourage more recycling because of the definitional problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australia needs to do&mdash;and I agree with the sentiments of this&mdash;is encourage an attitudinal change to rubbish. Recycling has to assist as far as possible in the removal and landfill disposal of rubbish. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in June 1992, each person in Australia generates nearly one tonne of solid waste each year. That is a rather frightening statistic. It is estimated that there is only 13 years supply of tip fill space left in Australia. Again that is a frightening statistic that would worry all members of this House and all Australians. We need commercial incentives for recycling. This should not be hard because the cost for each household collection of landfill disposal is about 24c against a recycler charging a council between 5c and 8c per household collection. One can see the obvious difference if households engage in the recycling approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument focuses on what groups these sales tax exemptions have benefited. Have they encouraged the importation of paper? The honourable member for Dobell alluded to that situation. Has recycling been encouraged by this tax arrangement? Has a distorted market been produced where the companies using recycled papers, or claiming to use recycled papers, are able to price their goods more cheaply on the supermarket shelves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that excess demand for recycled paper has led to increases in demand for imported recycled paper, which is frequently not recycled at all or might not be 100 per cent recycled material. There we do have the problem of definition. Companies that are using materials that are produced from post-consumer waste that has been collected at the kerbside in Australia claim to be disadvantaged by this apparent loophole of the lack of a definition of the term `recycling'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 26 June 1992, the Government wants to remove these recycled products from the list of those exempt from sales tax. The Government believes that this Bill will remove a distortion from the marketplace, between manufacturers such as Kimberly-Clark, Amcor and APM on the one hand, and the recycling plants operated by Austissue and the like on the other. A number of these smaller plants are spread throughout Australia in the various capital cities and States. However, writing or drawing paper in pads on single sheets, accounting paper and unaddressed envelopes will remain exempt from the sales tax. The Government has failed to consider the work standards of Australia in developing a definition of the term `recycled'. The third draft, issued in June this year, says that unqualified use of recycled products shall be limited to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where the entire item . . . is made from post-consumer recycled materials . . . </PARA>

<PARA>If the Government had considered this advice and set an appropriate level of recycled content, which would recognise that there often has to be some addition of virgin fibres in reprocessing because of the deterioration in fibre length each time an article is used, we would be in a better position than we are today with our inability to enshrine a definition of the word `recycled' in this area of sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State of New York has calculated the percentage of recycled materials as being `the product weight after looking at all the feedstocks and outputs of the manufacturing process'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stupid feature of this legislation is that it is supposedly the aim of the Government to ensure that recycling occurs as often as possible.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the products which might fall within the class&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of recycled paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are not easy to identify . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was because an amendment moved by the Government allowed goods to qualify as a recycled item and hence be exempt from sales tax if all the fibre in the cardboard or paper had been previously used in the manufacture of other goods. There was no need for the fibre to have been repulped. The goods did not need to be of Australian origin. There was no need for the goods to be of Australian manufacture. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complicate matters even further, there was no requirement in the 1989 legislation for the recycled material to have been previously used by Australian consumers&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very important point, as the honourable member acknowledges. We have the bizarre situation whereby `paper mill broke', which is the technical term for paper which does not meet quality standards and never leaves the mill but which is then repulped, could count as a `good' that could be used quite legitimately in the production of so-called recycled paper. So paper which is good quality in the mill is put back into recycling. Therefore, an exemption from wholesale sales tax could be claimed in this instance. So, again, we have a definitional problem with what is recycled and what is in the process. Even new virgin pulp which was a by-product of the manufacture of pulp boards seems to be quite acceptable to use in recycled material. This is because it has been purchased by the paper mill and used in the production of other goods, the pulp boards, and so it can be said to be recycled. Again, honourable members can appreciate the difficulty with the definition of recycled material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These complications are typical of the trouble that the Government has got itself into by staying with the wholesale sales tax system. For instance, writing, drawing or printing paper that either is blank or has parallel lines to serve as a guide for writing, or its equivalent for graphs, is exempt from sales tax. What a wonderful and fine definition we have here to meet these guidelines for so-called recycled paper. I ask for the rationale of that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If paper is designed for computers and has carbon interleaves, it will not qualify for a sales tax exemption, even if the paper is made wholly from recycled fibres. This is because for sales tax purposes the whole product is looked at. So, there again, we have another remarkable definition from those who made this decision on sales tax. If paper is coloured by the use of ink during the printing process, it may become taxable, yet it really is no different in substance from recycled paper. Again, that is a stupid situation. What is the sense in these amendments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently argued that the Government's wholesale sales tax system is a great burden on industry. From the comments of the honourable member for Dobell and the comments that I have made, we can see that it is almost impossible to administer this legislation and for the Australian Tax Office to give sensible rulings, especially in this area of recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reasonable to expect that, when a Prime Minister gives such an emphasis to a statement before this House, as did Prime Minister Hawke on the environment, there will not be a partial reversal two years later. Yet, since this exemption from sales tax for some recycled paper products was brought in, the share of recycled toilet tissue in the Australian market has risen from one per cent to between 9 and 12 per cent. Similarly, exercise books made from recycled paper have increased their market share from 3 to 10 per cent. So we can see that there has been a change to recycled material. It is questionable whether the sales tax changes were important in this.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am delighted to see the change in the amounts used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important statistic is that waste paper usage in recycling rose in Australia by 100,000 tonnes to over 900,000 tonnes between 1990 and 1991&mdash;a dramatic change, if that figure is correct, in the way in which recycled material has been collected and used. There has been a lot of discussion in this House and by the commentators about Austissue, a West Australian company which has expanded its kerbside recycling collections and has done a very good job in collecting good quality paper. It has indicated to me that it is not concerned by the coalition's planned introduction of a goods and services tax in 1994 because it has a long lead time in which to plan its operations. Quick changes in the rules, as favoured by the Keating Government, are another matter. The continual back flips and changes from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) confuse companies and lead to lower levels of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, honourable members and members of the voting public fully understand the advantages of the Fightback proposals for businesses such as Austissue&mdash;that business taxes will be reduced, payroll tax will be removed, excise duty will be removed and wholesale sales tax will be totally removed&mdash;and we will not have these sorts of arguments in debates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, wholesale sales tax, as the honourable member interjects, would be totally removed. The whole issue of what sort of a tax regime this Government should be following is brought into sharp focus by this Bill and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. Nothing can hide Labor's previous support, through the parliamentary leadership, for a goods and services tax. I cannot find a rational explanation for the shift by the present Prime Minister away from his 1985 drive to have a fairer tax system and therefore to introduce a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recycling legislation is part of the Government's supposed push towards a simplification of the wholesale sales tax system. The new Bills now before the Senate and the subject of much discussion, need 1,200 pages of legislation. The Government is still trying to reduce the existing 27 Acts governing sales tax to six new Acts, yet the Treasurer released a statement outlining major changes to sales tax the night before the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation was to hold public hearings. The 150 witnesses, who had prepared their submissions in expectation that the Bills would not change, were massively inconvenienced, having prepared their material just a few days before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office is now panicking and suggesting that, if the Senate does not finish dealing with the Bills quickly, the proposed changes to sales tax might have to be delayed until after the election. That would be a good thing for the Australian public, who can fully understand the impact of these sales tax changes as they affect individual companies and people. But, if these changes are brought in in a rush, the end result will be more High Court challenges and more bonanzas for lawyers in interpreting these pieces of sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1984, in the Australian Tax Forum, Professor Due observed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sales tax systems fall generally into two classes: generally acceptable and controversial . . . the value added tax . . . falls into the acceptable category . . . but . . . and wholesale sales taxes in developed industrial countries are unstable levies . . . demonstrated by Canadian experience and . . . in Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand . . . (in these latter countries), change in form is required . . . can be attained more easily if the basic tax structure is altered . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is what our Fightback proposals advocate. The wholesale sales tax system makes new goods notoriously difficult to classify. We have seen examples of this in this Bill. I hope that this problem does not continue to bedevil paper manufacturers and users, although, unfortunately, I think it will with the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of that most important class, the 96 per cent of Australia's 800,000 businesses that employ fewer than 20 staff, ring my office and say that they have been given three different answers by the staff of the Australian Taxation Office as to their liability for sales tax. That is another problem that all members of this House have from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992, is another example of the confusion behind the sales tax. What the Government is doing by stealth in this Bill is reneging on an agreement entered into between the Australian Taxation Office and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association to refund sales tax if a High Court challenge to the validity of the sales tax legislation were successful which, as we know, turned out to be the case. Can other taxpayers be sure that the Australian Taxation Office will abide by its agreements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pool builder, under this Bill, has to initiate a refund claim. But several who were not members of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association have gone out of business under the recession we had to have. The Government is saying that, if one is unlucky enough to choose Laz-a-way Pools Pty Ltd as one's builder, one cannot obtain a refund. So the unlucky consumer is hit a second time, possibly having had a difficult time arranging construction of his pool in the first place. How can the uncertainty generated by these two Bills help Australian business? Consumer confidence is low. This whole Bill is about uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills really show up the ancient nature of Labor's tax system. The Treasurer has failed to create a business environment of consistency and certainty. Where is there equity when the rules are changed twice in less than the space of a parliamentary term? Despite having a Prime Minister who knows full well the benefit to Australia that the abolition of a wholesale sales tax and a dramatic lowering of personal income tax rates would bring, the Government chooses to renege on his promises of 1985, like a boxer who will not stand up for the count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the not too distant future, under a Hewson government, I look forward to having the chance to speak on a much more equitable package of Bills, with a change to the structure and a more equitable and comprehensible tax arrangement in Australia, and not this ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. All members of the House, and Government speakers especially, have ably demonstrated to date that they cannot understand it and do not know how to interpret it. The only way to handle the wholesale sales tax system is to abolish it, as the new Hewson Government will do in October 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the House tonight are two sales tax Bills. The Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992 deals with changes following a High Court decision regarding the applicability of sales tax on in-ground swimming pools. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992 deals with changes regarding the application of sales tax to certain recycled paper products. The Bills invite the House, as did the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), to canvass the issues involved with the virtues of a sales tax system vis-a-vis those proposals put forward by the Opposition, namely, a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition argues, as demonstrated by the previous speaker, that the wholesale sales tax system is ramshackle or inconsistent, or a system which is falling down, difficult to administer and impossible to understand. All those descriptions are given by Opposition members. The reality is quite different. The wholesale sales tax system in Australia certainly has its problems, and I would not claim that it does not&mdash;indeed, the entire tax system in this country has its problems, and I would not try to claim that it does not&mdash;but the approach of the Opposition is to throw the baby out with the bath water and to say, `There is absolutely no virtue whatsoever in the wholesale sales tax system. What you have to do is to throw it out, start again, and bring in a GST'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the criticisms which the Opposition levels at the wholesale sales tax system can equally be levelled at the GST. We had the previous speaker talking about the definitional problems that exist with the wholesale sales tax system and whether particular goods fall into one category or not. The claim is that with the GST, because everything is hit with the old 15 per cent, we will not have these definitional problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, having spoken most recently to the local councils in my area, there do appear to be a few definitional problems. Certain items conducted by local authorities under the GST proposals apparently will be zero rated, whereas other ones will attract the GST. So we get down to this definition of what is a commercial enterprise being conducted by the local councils. If it were such a straightforward matter which did not exercise the mind at all as to the definition of particular activities, one would think it would be fairly straightforward to say to the councils, `Yes, your water system will come under this, the garbage system will come under this, but your general rates will not come under this, and the other things you do will or will not'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seem to be having an awful amount of difficulty getting out of the Opposition exactly which services will be zero rated and which will not in terms of the services provided by local government. I might be only a naive member, but it appears to me that there are the odd definitional problems amongst the Opposition's proposals. We had the recent little controversy raging about wheelchairs and artificial limbs, with memos being written. There was the question of the status of a memo and whether it was official coalition policy or not, but that is another thing. There are obviously some items that even the coalition believes should not be subject to the GST and should be zero rated. The coalition is grappling with those items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) stated very clearly that it was never the intention that artificial limbs, wheelchairs and other things for people with disabilities would have the GST levied on them. I accept what he says, that that is not the intention. But the point to draw from it, and one of the major criticisms which is levied at the existing wholesale sales tax system, is that there is an ability to have differential rates and to exempt some items from the tax altogether. Opposition members are kidding themselves if they do not think there is some advantage in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks around the world at countries which have a GST, a VAT or a consumption tax, or whatever one wants to call it, it is not at all uncommon to see differential rates&mdash;which is common with our wholesale sales tax system&mdash;with some items exempted or zero rated from the tax. Indeed, a number of the European countries do not apply GST to the basic necessities of life or, if they do, they at least apply a lower rate of GST to those basic necessities. In some countries which have a GST, food, clothing and footwear and other basic necessities are not actually taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the Opposition recognises that within its own proposals, it has its own definitional difficulties in terms of what will be covered by their proposals. An example is that it cannot at this stage tell local governments what is covered, even though it has in mind items which it believes should not be covered by the tax, such as artificial limbs, wheelchairs and other products dealing with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though those opposite have problems with their own proposals, they stand here with such mock indignation and point to the wholesale sales tax system, saying, `This is shocking. Sometimes you have to make a decision as to whether a particular good falls into one category or another'. They then come forward and say, `This is ridiculous. You get situations where caviar is not taxed at all even though that is obviously a luxury good, but something else gets a 30 per cent sales tax on it'. They argue that that is a terrible outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of those sorts of distinctions&mdash;it is very easy to pluck them out in isolation and to say, `This proves there is something wrong with this system'&mdash;simply proves one of the strengths of the existing system, which is that we can pick and choose, and we can impose a higher rate of tax on things which can be considered as luxury items, so that jewellery, furs, Ferraris and other items can be taxed a bit higher&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are other items on which there is no tax whatsoever, and that includes foodstuffs. The reason why caviar is not taxed under the existing system is that it is regarded as a foodstuff. Obviously people can point to those distinctions and say, `Imported Italian suits do not attract a tax'. This is because they are clothing. The system does not go to those sorts of distinctions; it is not that complicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point the honourable member for Corangamite made&mdash;I will mention this before he leaves the chamber&mdash;is that the system is terribly difficult to administer. An advantage of the existing system is that it is not terribly difficult to administer. This is demonstrated by the fact that of the $9 billion in excess raised under the wholesale sales tax system about 0.5 per cent is used in administration. It is collected in a direct sense&mdash;people have to fill in the forms and remit money to the Taxation Office&mdash;by about 75,000 taxpayers or points of tax payment currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the GST proposal it is not 75,000 people filling in the forms, deciding whether their services are zero rated, how much is paid, what is the value added tax, the mark up and how much rebate they can claim on their tax; it is every business, every farmer and every enterprise in this country. Well over one million businesses, enterprises and farms will now be doing that. It may be easy for honourable members opposite to convince business people that somehow this is all going to be terribly simple and they are going to be better off filling in more forms, but I have a great deal of difficulty convincing people that there is some value in filling out the forms they have to fill out now. A lot of people come to me and say, `Get off my back, why are you asking me to deal with all this red tape?  Why should I be a tax collector for the Government in remitting all these forms?'. The Government is asking everyone to do it; every enterprise to do it. Yet one of the things it opposes in the existing system is that it is difficult to administer. It is not difficult to administer. The compliance costs are quite small in terms of the revenue that it brings in and it is in a relatively small number of taxpaying hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally it can be seen that the costs of complying with the GST, consumption tax, the VAT system, or whatever one calls it, are considerably higher than complying with a wholesale sales tax system. The number of taxpayers directly involved in filling out the forms, keeping records and getting their programs right so they can keep track of what is happening with their business&mdash;where they are buying and selling their goods and providing their services&mdash;is considerably more with the GST proposal than it is with the wholesale sales tax proposal. That is the administrative side of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the morality of this system? I do not think there is anything particularly morally wrong with having a system which has three tiers. It has things which are clearly a bit more at the top end of town, hardly the necessities of life. Why is it wrong for people who can afford these things to be paying a bit more? They should not be paying 30 per cent. Is it moral for a pensioner, a low income earner or an ordinary family to have to start paying on the necessities of life which, at the moment, are essentially tax free?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to come in here and say that everything is going to go up by 15 per cent or anything like that. Clearly, at the moment there is a whole range of goods which are currently attracting no tax, but under the Opposition's proposal they will attract tax. Those opposite then have to try to devise compensation packages to make sure that no-one is worse off. When we examined these proposals in 1985-86,  the then Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, walked away from them. We could not devise a compensation package which put people in at least the same position before the introduction of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that, when the proposals were given to the people in Treasury and the Department of Finance&mdash;they were asked to look at them and to assess the outcome&mdash;they said, `Three out of four taxpayers under the GST proposal will be worse off'; that is, about 75 per cent of Australians will be worse off. The Opposition says that it is all politically motivated and biased and it is all done to try to knock it; it is not at all. For the same reason the Government did not go ahead with the thing back in the mid-1980s: one cannot devise a compensation package which does what it is supposed to do; that is, compensate people. That is why, when the analysis is done, people turn out to be worse off. It is okay if people are in a relatively strong income position and can afford to save a bit. They are not spending all their money on consumption; they are not spending everything they have just to live. If people can afford to save, then they will get some benefit out of the GST. Most people in my electorate, and I think most people in Opposition members' electorates, are not in that position, they are spending most of their wage packets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter a great deal whether tax is being paid at the income tax level or whether it is being paid when goods are being bought.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before the House tonight are a very good illustration of the broad points which have been canvassed during the debate. One of the benefits of the existing system is that it can be used to make policy decisions. One can decide whether to give particular products a differential rate of tax treatment or whether they bear no tax at all. One can do the same thing with particular organisations which are exempt from paying sales tax. That is exactly what happened in relation to the sales tax. As part of its environment policy, the Government decided that it was desirable in order to encourage the development of paper recycling industries in this country. So a decision was made to pick and choose in terms of the production of paper in this country. The Government decided not to impose a tax on the production of paper through recycled products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment before the House tonight obviously indicates that there have been some problems. Those problems have been identified through the Industry Commission report on recycling in Australia. This point has been well illustrated by previous speakers. We have seen the import of products from overseas, supposedly recycled, but in some cases they may not have been. We have also seen a move away from some recycled paper products in Australia&mdash;for instance tissue paper&mdash;which have traditionally come from plantations, and we have seen recycled paper moving into the market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minute which is left to me I would like to sum up the debate. We have before us two examples of how the wholesale sales tax system is flexible. It is a system which lends itself to delivering social policy goals&mdash;those same sorts of goals which would be divorced completely if we brought in a GST system. A GST system does not allow the flexibility to pick and choose between particular items; it does not allow people to decide to support the development of a recycled paper industry in Australia, for example. It applies a 15 per cent tax across the board and essentially takes away the Government's ability to use another arm of policy to deliver a social end. Exactly the same arguments apply to the swimming pool amendments. These amendments are relatively minor in the overall scheme of things, nonetheless I am pleased to be able to support them and I hope the House will do likewise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinary statement to say that the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill illustrate the flexibility of the wholesale sales tax system. I remind the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) that since 1986 people have been paying tax that they should not have been paying. They have been paying tax unconstitutionally. Some bright spark in the Treasury thought, `We'll tax swimming pools' and away the Government went with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the then Treasurer, saying, `Here's a good way of getting some more money out of the Australian people'. So off they went to tax swimming pools. Six years later nobody knows whether people will get their money back or whom they will get it back from. That is how flexible this system is. It is hopeless, ramshackle and out of date&mdash;like the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter we are dealing with today involves the recycling of paper products. This is a well-intentioned proposal, but what has happened? We have been giving an advantage to those people who are recycling paper offshore, not to manufacturers of Australian products. These goods are being produced by foreigners to the detriment of Australians. I cannot follow the commonsense of that. Yet the honourable member said that these anomalies&mdash;these stupid decisions by government&mdash;illustrate the flexibility of the wholesale sales tax system. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, Australians are punished unnecessarily and are in the dreadful position of trying to get money&mdash;which they have been illegally forced to pay&mdash;from pool builders, the Federal Government and the State governments. Who knows where they will get it from. A lot of the companies have gone bust. These people have to demonstrate that they have actually paid wholesale sales tax, and I do not know how they will do that. I do not know how many people keep the bills for their swimming pools for six years to prove that a mistake might have been made by government at some stage. I would suggest that not too many people do that. The Government is prepared to take it out of the hide of the Australian people and then claim that this is a flexible system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, in order to encourage the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Government gave an exemption to recycled paper. That was a wonderful idea, except the Government had not thought it through. Most of the paper which is recycled, when it is recycled, is brought into Australia. Very little paper is recycled within Australia. So the benefits of this process have served to increase employment overseas, to increase Australian debt and to decrease the participation of Australian industry in recycling. In these two measures we have perfect illustrations of how hopeless the wholesale sales tax system is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992. It clearly sets out the items which have wholesale sales tax and the amount of wholesale sales tax which applies to them. It also lists the exempt materials. But it is very interesting to note that at the rate of 10 per cent wholesale sales tax we have things such as goods used for household purposes: detergents and other things used around the house. </PARA>

One not only has to have poor personal hygiene, but also needs to smell bad as well. That is social justice under the Labor Party's policy of imposing wholesale sales tax on very simple, ordinary, everyday necessities which are used in every home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matches and firelighters are mentioned. People lighting the old fuel stove or the gas are penalised every time they strike a match or click a lighter. Dad comes home from a hard day on the job, working for the benefit of the family, and mum cannot even prepare tea without paying wholesale sales tax. What an injustice to put on the Australian people. But honourable members opposite then have the hide to say what a wonderful tax this wholesale sales tax is. They should get real; they have overplayed this thing to billyo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some other items which currently have a 10 per cent wholesale sales tax. I point out to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am speaking to the schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992 where all of these items are listed. Attached to the schedule we see things such as confectionary, biscuits and flavoured milk. So flavoured milk for children attracts wholesale sales tax, as well as confectionary and certain biscuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the definitional problems start to arise. Is a Kit Kat a biscuit or confectionary? The Tax Office decides. It claims that a Kit Kat is confectionery, but a chocolate-coated Arnott's biscuit is not confectionery&mdash;it is good, wholesome food. Honourable members should go to the shop shelves and try to work out for themselves what should be included in this schedule and at what rate it should be taxed. Juices made from at least 25 per cent pure Australian fruit or vegetable juice&mdash;also juices from New Zealand or Papua New Guinea&mdash;are taxed at 10 per cent. So even the orange juice that kids drink is taxed. How far are Government members prepared to go in claiming that this is a wonderful tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move on to passenger vehicles. The Government knocked off the 30 per cent tax on luxury vehicles and now wants to impose a 15 per cent rate. The 30 per cent rate applies to the remaining luxury vehicles, fur skins and garments made from fur skins, and jewellery and goods made from precious stones or metal. Wedding and engagement rings are included because they cannot be defined out. Watches and clocks are in there. Nobody can get to the office or to school on time without watches and clocks; they are critical to our society. Even tape recorders, which are normal household furniture these days and are essential in the educational process, are taxed at 30 per cent. Cameras are taxed also. Kids come to Parliament House with little cameras to take photographs to record their visit to the Parliament. All these items are taxed at 30 per cent under this wonderful social justice tax&mdash;the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot present a reasonable case for these definitions and categorisations of goods and services used in different ways by different Australians living in different circumstances throughout the length and breadth of this great country. But those opposite think they can deliver a social welfare program by picking for people which things should be taxed at 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 30 per cent and which things should be exempt. Because the situation has become so confused, sales tax simplification legislation has been put before the Senate. It contains a set of proposals to clean up this mess that we are talking about. Those opposite put this legislation before the Senate and it is wonderful that they have really good intentions. </PARA>

In other words, because it is too hard for them to sort out, Labor members are to hand the matter over to the Commissioner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague is right to make the point that transport costs are been gradually added into everything. So the transport component in wholesale sales tax is bearing a tax.

It is not going to work and it is not going to wash. Thank goodness we have a Senate Committee working on the matter. I hope it is given time to sort out the mess. The simplification that the Government has proposed for the wholesale sales tax system is not a simplification, but a horrific mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it goes right back to 1983 when the then Treasurer said that he felt there should be a diverse way of collecting tax in Australia and consequently he went out to get more tax from indirect sources. He raised taxes from indirect sources from about $3 billion to currently about $11 billion. So whether Labor members like it or not, this is being seen as a hunting ground by the former Treasurer, currently the Prime Minister, to raise additional revenue. Even the simplification legislation does not take the revenue off; it adds more revenue and more cost to our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again those opposite have been increasing, changing and manipulating the wholesale sales tax system simply because it is a hidden tax and they do not want people to know how much tax they are paying. People are starting to find out. They should find out because some of the goods that they use every day&mdash;such as household goods, baths, sinks, toilets, bathroom fittings, toilet cleaners, deodorisers, confectionery and other simple things&mdash;are taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor members have to be honest enough to admit it. They have to be honest enough to indicate that a simplified system is needed. They have tried to do it through a most complex system of Bills that has thrown up so many inconsistencies in relation to the building industry, donations, deemed manufactures and containers. Indeed, a Senate Committee has been working through the recess on the matter, and it is returning to it, to try to make good this Government's terrible legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members have passed it over to the Taxation Commissioner to do it all for them. We sat down, looked at the whole system and said, `Let's change it, let's make it simple and let's change the tax system too'. Australians deserve more incentive by having more of their hard-earned money in their pocket so that they can choose what they buy. When they choose what they buy, they pay tax. Those opposite want to get the money as it goes into their pockets through personal income tax and then they want to get it as it comes out too. So I think one needs a simplified approach through a goods and services tax. It is easily understood, it is on all products, and it is simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proper compensation can be given to people on fixed or lower incomes so that they can afford the slightly higher prices. It would not be a 15 per cent increase. We said on our side that the cost of all goods across the board could increase by 4.4 per cent. But Treasury came along and said, `No, the Opposition has it wrong. The figure is 3.6 per cent, not 4.4 per cent'. So it is somewhere about 4 per cent. We will compensate pensioners and people on fixed incomes by giving them an 8 per cent increase. They will also be given tax credits if they happen to miss out on the 8 per cent increase. There is even wealth compensation; the family allowance will be doubled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is the system that now operates. Two classic examples of how hopeless the wholesale sales tax system is are before us today. The first I wish to deal with is the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992, which was introduced on 25 June. It goes back to the proposals by the Government that in order to encourage the reprocessing of paper products, it would exempt recycled paper from wholesale sales tax. The result has been that Australian-made products have been set to one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech for the Bill that we are dealing with today says that it is better to deal with environmental concerns by removing the incentive to direct high quality paper to recycling areas where the product would be used once only. It has been reported that the exemptions have resulted in increased imports and damage to domestic producers of virgin paper products. That is the nub of the matter. People in Australia have been damaged by what seemed like a good idea at the time. Like all the measures introduced by the then Treasurer, they have good intentions of increasing taxation but they do not come clean on the processes by which that tax is to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the general effect of the partial removal of an exemption cannot be quantified, it is likely that it would result in an increase in prices of goods in respect of which the exemption will be removed and that certain individual companies will be affected. We have heard about an Australian company that will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, it will be back to a fair game for all involved in this business, whether they produce tissues or disposable napkins for children. All of these are household products. The Government has realised the folly of its ways in trying to intervene in an appropriate policy initiative by fiddling with the wholesale sales tax system to advance an environmental result. Definitions have been hopeless. The types of paper, the qualities of paper and the products to which the recycling advantage would apply all had to be defined. Whether the product was coloured, whether it was cardboard or had gum on it had to be defined, and the system was unsuccessful. The Government has the support of the Opposition in rectifying that matter, but there is no better example of how hopeless the system is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Bill we are dealing with is the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. Some bright spark in Treasury said that in-ground swimming pools ought to be taxed because fibreglass pool shells were taxed. Efforts were made to devise a tax to apply to the reinforcing of swimming pools and the concrete shell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who were building home pools in their gardens asked, `How do we pay in respect of this?'. The process involved a prime constructor and a subcontractor. The people concerned had to work out how they were going to pay wholesale sales tax. Then what happens when the big pool manufacturers put in a pebble dash surround, install a fountain and carry out landscaping? It would be very interesting to know whether one would be able to separate the price of the shell from the landscaping and the waterfalls. That will be an interesting little administrative process to sort out when people come to make their claims to get back this illegally paid tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then what happened?  The bright spark in 1986 got his legislation through. The Government supported it. The tax has been paid. Then somebody asked: how on earth can the Federal Government start taxing permanent structures in a process of excise or a process of wholesales sales tax?  Of course, it cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a six to one decision the High Court threw out this legislation as being unconstitutional. Then there is the mess of trying to resolve the problem of all the money that has been paid and getting it back to the people who paid it. That proves that the wholesale sales tax system is ramshackle, hopeless and out of date, with definitional and administrative problems. There have been instances of deputy commissioners in three different States charging different rates of wholesale sales tax. I remember dealing with a case involving billiard tables where three States were charging different rates; they could not classify the item. It took over two years for the Commissioner himself to determine what the rate should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, advocated a consumption tax system such as a goods and services tax. I believe it is the only way that Australians are going to get money in their pockets from their efforts and their earnings. It will come in their cheques because they will have reduced taxation. Everybody will have their taxes reduced by 30 per cent. People will be better off because they will have more money in their pockets and day by day they will be able to make the choice as to what they spend their money on. There will be proper compensation for those who need compensation because prices have risen. The rest of the community will be able to work those few extra hours overtime without penalty, to take a second job or to take a promotion. This is a classic example of government gone crazy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The object of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill is to remove the exemption for sales tax for certain recycled paper products. The following goods, if they are made wholly from recycled fibre, will become taxable: books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing; toilet paper and facial tissues; and paper bags marketed for household purposes or for use in marketing goods sold by retail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sales tax exemption was introduced in 1989 with the objective of encouraging paper recycling to reduce the demand on native forests. New waste retrieval initiatives have been established in many offices and departments which have increased the collection of used high quality writing papers for recycling. But overall the exemption has contributed little to its objective of saving native forests and has led to major distortions in the paper recycling industry which are now threatening many Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax exemption will now concentrate on encouraging the production of 100 per cent recycled writing papers and envelopes, for which there was previously a lack of consumer acceptance. Recycled writing papers require a higher quality of waste inputs and have led to the establishment of new office paper recycling programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lower grades of waste paper were used in the production of recycled packaging materials long before the sales tax exemption was introduced. The wider range of exemptions had diverted this waste into production of tax exempt goods without any discernible increase in the recycling rate of Australian waste papers. The narrowing of the exemption will allow this waste to be recycled into products for which it is best suited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tissues and toilet papers are traditionally made from pine plantation material and the sales tax exemption had encouraged the production of these goods from high quality waste paper which could have been utilised more efficiently elsewhere. This was discouraging long term investment in sustainable plantation development. While some recycled pulp may be used in the production of single use goods such as tissues and toilet papers, the Government does not consider it appropriate to subsidise the process through a tax concession. In any case, manufacturers who were using some, but not 100 per cent, recycled fibre in the production of these goods were not obtaining any tax assistance and were doing so on the basis of practicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background in relation to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992, the sales tax law was amended in 1986 to overcome an anomaly whereby swimming pools constructed in situ were free from sales tax while other pools were subject to sales tax. For example, the sale of an in-ground concrete pool was not taxable, while the sale of an in-ground fibreglass pool shell or an above-ground pool was taxable. In February 1992 the High Court ruled that the amendments were of no effect. As a result of this decision, there was uncertainty about who was entitled to a refund and what the basis for refunding the amounts paid as sales tax would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to establish a refund code to deal with refunds following that decision. It seeks to ensure that the pool purchasers receive the benefit of any refunds of amounts paid as sales tax on swimming pools. Pool builders, as registered sales tax payers, were liable for and paid amounts to the Commonwealth as sales tax on swimming pools. It is therefore the builders who are entitled to claim refunds from the Commonwealth. However, a builder would usually have recouped the amount paid as sales tax from the pool purchaser as part of the price charged for the pool. To ensure that a builder does not get a windfall gain, the Bill provides that the builder will be entitled to a refund from the Commonwealth only if he or she has first made a refund to the purchaser. A refund will also be available if a pool builder can demonstrate that the amount paid as a sales tax was not recouped from the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for interest to be paid to the extent that a builder is out of pocket. A builder who refunds to a purchaser will be entitled to interest from the date that refund is made to the date the Australian Tax Office makes a refund to the builder. A builder who did not recoup the tax will be entitled to a refund from the date on which the amount was paid to the ATO to the date on which the ATO makes the refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To obtain a refund, the Bill requires a pool builder to make a declaration in a form approved by the Commissioner to the effect that the amount paid as sales tax was either not passed on to the purchaser or, if it was passed on, it has since been refunded to the purchaser. The form of the declaration is being prepared by the Australian Taxation Office and will be available when the Bill receives royal assent. The Bill will commence on the date it receives the royal assent and will apply to amounts paid as sales tax on swimming pools from August 1986 to February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate the Opposition has mentioned the complexity of wholesale sales tax. It is important to recognise, as the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) did, that at present approximately 70,000 small business people pay wholesale sales tax. Honourable members on the other side of the House have put their view on the advantages of abolishing the wholesale sales tax. Over one million business and farmers would be required to comply with a goods and services tax. It is a fact that in Australia the wholesale sales tax collects something like $10 billion. A GST will collect close to $27 billion. There was criticism of wholesale sales tax applying to some types of orange juice and on Kit Kats.

I was commenting on the previous speaker's summation and criticism of the wholesale sales tax arrangements and his analysis of why a 4.4 per cent increase across the board was good under a GST. I believe that the wholesale sales tax is fair inasmuch as it does discriminate&mdash;it discriminates in favour of food such as fruit and vegetables, meat, milk and bread. A GST does not discriminate at all. It is like napalm; it takes everyone out at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell made the comment that the Government considered a consumption tax. We did; that is true. We did not adopt the consumption tax because there is no way that one can compensate people for the introduction of a GST.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying before the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) called a point of order on me, there is no way we can compensate pensioners with an 8 per cent increase in their pension when the majority of their pension, if not all, is taxed at 15 per cent. They are 7 per cent worse off. The idea that there is an increase of only 4.4 per cent is very unfair because it accounts, as I said, for Ferraris and other things that pensioners do not have. The real effect is that they are 15 per cent worse off: 8 per cent from 15 leaves 7. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker said that people are better off, in a taxing regime, under the GST. That is not correct either. Low income earners will receive a reduction from 21 per cent to 16 per cent in direct tax; that is true. But then they will pay 15 per cent on every good and service they use. But if one assumes that someone on $20,000 or $22,000 will put away only $20 or $30 a week, they will actually pay 31c in the dollar on all bar that money that they save. But immediately they take that money out of the bank it will incur a tax of 15 per cent in any case. </PARA>

So not only will workers receive less money&mdash;which means they will not be able to work out what tax benefits they will earn with the reduction from 21 per cent to 16 per cent&mdash;but also they will actually pay 15c in every dollar for every good and service that they use. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called simplification procedure has done little more than highlight the need for the wholesale sales tax to be abolished. The Government has been forced to back down from some of its biggest blunders in this legislation. Farm machinery dealers were extremely concerned by the provisions of this legislation before the Government came to its senses, and I am glad that it has come to its senses on this. I have had farm machinery dealers and their workers calling my office about being forced out of business and about losing their jobs. Already enough Australians have lost their jobs under this Government. </PARA>

This legislation was troubled from the day it came in. It was introduced after very little consultation with the business community, even though the Government announced its plans in August 1990. The legislation was guillotined through the House of Representatives and had to be referred to the Senate Select Committee for further examination. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prima facie intention of the Government legislation is to simplify the mechanics of the sales tax system. In reality this seems to change the tax treatment of some goods and broaden the tax base. Who knows whether that is deliberate or accidental. I am sure the Government itself does not know. It keeps blundering along, having to make changes all the time. But whatever it does, it reveals the problems with sales tax and why it needs a drastic overhaul. The sales tax system is far too complicated and unwieldy, and it is a burden on business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this afternoon I had some contact with a constituent of mine who is troubled about sales tax.

It is now operating 22 vehicles all over Australia, and is involved in wilderness, rainforest and beach tours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty that this particular constituent has is that he is operating with four-wheel drive vehicles, which are necessary for the particular activities. The activities are certainly relished by domestic and overseas tourists. Years ago the sales tax system as it related to tourist and bus operators allowed the purchase of vehicles of 12 seats or more to be sales tax exempt because they were used for hire and reward for student, domestic and international clientele. Times have changed. We now have four-wheel drive vehicles used in tourism. Previously there were no smaller vehicles, so the limitation was 12 seats. But in recent years, with the increase in adventure and ecotourism, which is increasingly important, there is a need to use smaller four-wheel drive vehicles. So the sales tax exemption cutting out at 12 seats is unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, and indeed to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Commissioner of Taxation, the need to examine this particular point because of its vital importance to tour operators right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is grossly unfair that in this tourism business those who can use only a smaller style vehicle have the problem of having to pay sales tax, whereas if there were a larger one available it would be tax exempt. Certainly the smaller vehicles are much more appropriate and are more in tune with the environment, so I say that it is appropriate that there be a re-evaluation of this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax, of course, is a tax on business and it is a tax that really does not have any rhyme or reason. The Government is trying to fix up a broken system. We in the coalition offer a different system, a simpler system, a fairer system. It is called Fightback, and of course it includes the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and a variety of other taxes as well, such as the payroll tax and the fuel excise levy, which are a direct cost on business and prevent businesses employing people, which they really need to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one point I would like to mention because I think it is very significant and very relevant, and it applies to wholesale sales tax. When we win the next election we will abolish the wholesale sales tax and those companies, those retailers, and those businesses with stock on hand which have paid wholesale sales tax will get it refunded. They should realise that the change is going to happen. It does not matter whether it comes as a cheque straight away or as a rebate in their first GST return. For instance, if one is a jeweller or owns a gift store and all of one's stock has 30 per cent wholesale sales tax on it, one should just work out the value. That is the amount that one will get back. That is a significant amount for every business that has paid wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at automotive dealers and the wholesale sales tax of 15 per cent on sedans, 20 per cent on other vehicles, or even 30 per cent on luxury vehicles.

That will have a major impact on the conduct of his business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is trying to fix the wholesale sales tax, but it cannot because every time it tries it is like a hydra; it chops off one head and another one comes up. It is another bungle. The only way to fix the wholesale sales tax situation is to scrap it. The choice is between the goods and services tax, which is simple, efficient, fair and user friendly, or the wholesale sales tax which is complex, out of control, an administrative nightmare and full of anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should realise that it will not get any tax reform through because it cannot tackle it where it should be tackled. The Government should come clean and acknowledge that a goods and services tax is the best way to fix our tax system, along with the abolition of wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the fuel excise levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote our present Prime Minister because he is on record as supporting a consumption tax, a goods and services tax. In June 1985, the Prime Minister said, `This structure of indirect taxes is highly discriminatory'. Of course, he was right. He also suggested that it was undesirable. He was right again. The multiple rates and the exemptions distort both demand and supply. As I have already pointed out, the tax has to be carried as a cost burden by retailers when goods sit in their stocks, and the high proportion of the wholesale sales tax, about half of it, is a tax on business inputs, a tax on employment, a tax which really keeps business going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by giving the House a condemnation of sales tax direct from the horse's mouth. The particular horse I refer to is the present Prime Minister. When he was then Treasurer, he concluded, `For all of these reasons, we are inclined to scrap the entire sales tax'. How right he was. Why did he not do it? He could not do it because he was controlled, as always, by the ACTU. This Government has been hamstrung by its dependence on its union bosses.

It is not good enough just to sit back and suffer with at least one million unemployed, businesses going broke all the time and farmers suiciding. This country is in dire straits. We have to have a major change. We cannot just sit back and let the present Government bungle through any more. Without any doubt, we have to have an election, we have to toss out the present Government and we have to give the coalition the opportunity to save Australia for the future of our children and our grandchildren.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with a great deal of interest to the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner and noted with some interest the wide ranging nature of that debate. Just before dinner the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was telling us about the effects on tourist vehicles of various sales tax regimes, which was a fairly broad net to cast over the matters before the House. Before him, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) quite creatively referred to the original Act of 1935 and the schedule attached thereto, which sets out the sales tax for every item in the land. Given that fairly broad brief, I am keen to make a contribution this evening and to respond in part to some of the things said by honourable members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on these two Bills, there has been quite a deal said in contrasting the wholesale sales tax system with the alternative goods and services tax proposed by the Opposition. A number of quite misleading comments have been made by those opposite in that regard. The first and most significant difference that those opposite have sought to overlook in their contributions this evening is that a wholesale sales tax, as the name implies, is based on the wholesale price of the commodity; it is not based on the retail price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A goods and services tax is based on the retail price&mdash;that is, after the mark-up, the price we pay at the counter today. As a result of that difference, wholesale sales taxes of 20, 25 and even 30 per cent can be less in dollar terms than a retail goods and services tax of 15 per cent. When honourable members opposite such as the honourable member for Mitchell recite the series of commodities on which the wholesale sales tax applies, they conveniently overlook the fact that, even at the general rate of 20 per cent, those commodities are cheaper than they would be with the Opposition's goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point, which relates directly to the legislation before us concerning the exemptions and classifications legislation, is the way in which the wholesale sales tax system is able to be targeted to meet certain needs. The Bills before us are a clear demonstration of that. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill deliberately sets about exempting some goods from the sales tax system while ensuring that other goods are subject to sales tax. The contrast to that is the Opposition's goods and services tax, which is a 15 per cent impost on everything, with hardly an exception in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) coined the phrase this evening of a napalm bomb approach to taxation: it obliterates everything in its path. The goods and services tax does not discriminate. It does not allow government to ensure that some environmentally friendly products, for example, are cheaper, are given an advantage and are provided with a tax incentive by the Government. The legislation before us this evening ensures that some recycled products are exempt from tax while others are not. The Bill before the House this evening seeks to redirect investment in recycled paper products into those areas which can in turn be recycled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point concerning the comparison between the wholesale sales tax and the Opposition's goods and services tax is that the wholesale sales tax applies only to goods. It does not apply to services directly, and even in the wildest calculations of its indirect effect it is remarkably small. That did not stop the honourable member for Mitchell talking, in response to an interjection from one of the National Party members, about the wholesale sales tax on transport costs. That is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a service, transport costs are not subject to a wholesale tax at all; nor is the wide range of services generally available to the public. Catching a train or bus, getting a haircut, going to the picture show and going to the football on the weekend are now all free from the impost of taxation. The Opposition's goods and services tax immediately imposes a 15 per cent charge on each and every one of those items and many more. Going to the vet or buying a dog or a pet budgerigar from the pet shop, all of which are now free from tax, will be subject to a goods and services tax under a Liberal-led government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense for the honourable members opposite who have spoken in this debate to try to draw a comparison and say that Australians will be better off as a result of their policies in introducing a goods and services tax. Even they are coming to understand that the Australian public does not accept that assertion, and it is quite clear that the Australian public is not about to endorse it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer directly to a couple of aspects of the two Bills before the House this evening. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill is designed to tidy up some areas of sales tax law that have led to unintended consequences with environmentally friendly products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago the Government took a decision to provide a tax break, a sales tax exemption, for a range of recycled paper products. Over the last couple of years in which that policy has been in place, it has become clear that one of the unintended consequences of that is that much-needed resources in recycling are being diverted to producing recycled products which in themselves are not then recycled. High quality waste paper is being used, for example, in the manufacture of tissues, paper bags and a couple of other items that are listed in the Bill. In the main, those items are not recycled. That is notwithstanding the fact that Australia has a very good record as far as recycling paper is concerned. We are one of the largest recyclers of paper in the world. Australia's performance and the way in which the public has acknowledged the need to carefully manage our finite resources are second to none in the world, and this Government has supported that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the measures taken some years ago to provide tax exemption for some of those products have meant that business has redirected some of its resources to producing recycled products using high quality inputs. The desire of the Government is to see recycled products not thrown away to become land fill; the Government's desire is to see those recycled products in turn put back into the recycling process. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill is before us tonight to lift the exemption from some of those products so that they no longer distort the marketplace and no longer attract investment funds, and instead to maintain a tax exemption on those paper products which our recent history has shown us will after use be put back into the recycling process. That is a good thing for the future of all of us, and it should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate the Opposition has sought to make some great mileage out of that, as if some monumental error was made by the Government a few years ago. It is more than a bit hypocritical for those opposite to claim that, in view of their own position, which is to impose a 15 per cent goods and services tax on all of those recycled products and to provide no incentive for people to use a recycled product rather than one which uses up a lot more resources as a top quality virginal paper production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the Opposition's policy, it has sought to claim that the changes contained in the amendment Bill which is before us tonight somehow demonstrate a basic flaw in the original legislation. That is simply not true. The original legislation, as I have already outlined, provided for incentives to encourage Australians to purchase recycled products. The Government is now refining that policy to ensure that those recycled products which we encourage consumers to purchase are in the main products which will in turn be recycled. It is a sensible amendment and it is one which deserves the endorsement of both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill relates to the sales tax on concrete swimming pools that have been built in situ. An anomaly existed in the past whereby people who had an in-ground concrete pool built were exempt from paying tax. However, if a person bought a fibreglass shell and put it in the same hole, sales tax was payable. If a person could not afford an in-ground pool and had an above-ground pool, sales tax was payable on that as well. Some years ago the Government sought to rectify that anomaly and imposed the same level of sales tax on all swimming pools so that in-ground pools, concrete pools built in situ, would be subject to the same tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the High Court ruled that that law was of no effect and was in breach of the Constitution. Accordingly, there are a number of people who have paid sales tax in line with the legislation as it stood whom the High Court has now determined were not required to make that payment. This Bill recognises that High Court decision and seeks to ensure that the moneys paid are returned in full to the person who made the payment. In most cases the person who made the payment was not the pool builder but the pool owner. This legislation will ensure that the pool builder passes on that sales tax windfall to the owner so that the person who owns the swimming pool, the person in whose backyard the pool sits, receives the benefit of the High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter which is of some concern to me, and which has been raised with me by some constituents, relates to circumstances where the company that constructed the pool maybe three or four years ago no longer exists. Regrettably, the pool construction industry is one in which there have been more than a few fly-by-night operators. It is an industry which could probably do with a bit of regulation and certification. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and his Department are addressing the difficulties of those Australians who are in the situation to which I have just referred where the person or the company that built their pool is no longer in operation. I know that is a difficulty which a number of people are facing, particularly in Queensland where, understandably, there are many swimming pools. I hope that the Treasurer and his Department will be in a position to provide a reimbursement of the sales tax to those pool owners, notwithstanding the fact that the company that built the pool may no longer be in existence. It is an important issue and it is one that I trust the Government will be able to deal with satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend the Government on introducing both pieces of legislation. The sales tax legislation does finetune an important article of Government policy. The Government is committed to the careful management of our resources. This Government has done more than any before it to protect our unique environment and to provide some long term future for our next generation&mdash;our children and their children. Through a tax system that can be done only with a system which is discretionary, one in which the Government is able to discern areas that deserve support and provide the sort of benefit that this legislation does through exempting some commodities from sales tax. It stands in stark contrast to the policies which the Opposition has announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's GST policy would lead to an increase in the price of a whole range of environmental products which this Government has exempted. Those opposite who want to hop up and complain about the legislation before the House this evening should also tell the people of Australia who are listening to this debate what the effect of their policy will be on those environmental products. The policies of those opposite will increase the cost to the consumer of a whole range of recycled products. That is environmentally irresponsible. Added to the other imposts which the GST includes, it is also socially undesirable. Opposition members should refrain from their rather pious contributions to this debate which we witnessed before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. </PARA>

From my point of view, that makes it iniquitous. Occasionally one buys something like a car part and the price is constructed on the basis of retail plus wholesale sales tax. It is only then that people realise how much they are actually being slugged on many of the items that they purchase. Often it comes as a great shock to people when they realise how much wholesale sales tax they are paying. What they do not realise also&mdash;</PARA>

If that is not taxation by stealth I do not know what is. This increase of over $7 billion has been achieved largely by broadening the range of goods subject to wholesale sales tax and by increasing the applicable rates to certain goods, without telling people.

It will not be increased by stealth, it will not be extended and it will be there and obvious for everyone to judge us on. We will not increase it behind people's backs, as this Government has done with the wholesale sales tax. We also intend to abolish not only wholesale sales tax in its entirety but also a lot of other taxes. We will substantially reduce personal income tax rates as a part of this package.

From what I have heard Government members say in this debate, it seems that they consider that a merit; that they consider the complexity, the flexibility&mdash;whatever the words were that they used&mdash;of the wholesale sales tax system to be commendable. That seems strange logic to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look no further for an ideal case study in the mechanics of wholesale sales tax and its total inadequacy than the paper products that we are talking about. The issues addressed in this legislation have been canvassed by previous speakers. It is true that the legislation appears to address some anomalies. But let us be fair about this: the anomalies exist only because of the wholesale sales tax system itself. That created the problem. This legislation is now intended to help to close some loopholes or to address some anomalies, or what these days we often hear called unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, for business people&mdash;the people who those opposite fail to understand&mdash;these sorts of anomalies arise every day. Earlier in the day I heard one of my colleagues talking about the difference between Kit Kats and Arnott's Monte chocolate biscuits and the problems of definition for people in business. Whether wholesale sales tax applies and what rates apply are a constant source of concern for most business people. They seek advice from the Australian Taxation Office, which advice is often ambivalent. But they are constantly talking to the Tax Office about whether the tax applies to a particular product or component and at what rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in the second Bill, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. It is probably fair to say that in my electorate in the south-east corner of Queensland there are as many swimming pools as there are constituents. Naturally, I have been contacted by many of my constituents who have had concrete in-ground pools constructed since 1986, and also by many pool manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the honourable member for Brisbane cast some aspersions on pool builders and suggested that they are fly-by-nighters. I can tell him that since 1986 a lot of pool builders have gone out of business but it has not been because they were fly-by-nighters, although in any industry there might be one or two; they have been forced out of business by this Government's recession&mdash;</PARA>

Many of them are legitimate small business people and the work that they do is valued by many people. The fact that many of them who were in business in 1986 are not in business now is not so much because they ripped people off but because the recession forced them out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at this legislation for a second ideal case study in the inadequacies of the wholesale sales tax system. As the honourable member for Brisbane said, this legislation on concrete in-ground pools was introduced to correct an anomaly vis-a-vis fibreglass pools that were subject to sales tax. As we know&mdash;this has been recounted in this debate&mdash;action was taken by the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia, and the wholesale sales tax on concrete pool shells was found in February 1992 by the High Court to be illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us the most incredible piece of legislation which, even by this Government's standards, is an absolute disgrace. It is a pity that debates are not carried on in this place in a sense to convince one side or the other that there might be some right. The honourable member for Brisbane, in a backhanded way, acknowledged one major problem with this legislation when he glossed over the fact that many pool builders have gone out of business. I want to cover that because in my view that was an admission of what is one of the fundamental flaws of the approach that this Government has taken with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hark back to the luxury car tax fiasco. Honourable members may remember that the Government increased the sales tax on luxury cars, which was going to raise $100m. It brought in a piece of legislation some months later which repealed that position after it had found that, rather than making $100m, it had lost $100m. It had sent some car dealers broke and that led to a lot of unemployment into the bargain when people stopped buying luxury cars. But the luxury car tax looks like a public relations coup for the Government compared with this piece of legislation. The Government surely has got itself in a terrible mess on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer just briefly to the Budget Statements, in which the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will introduce legislation, with the earliest possible date of effect, to ensure that any refunds of amounts collected as sales tax on swimming pool shells constructed in situ under the provisions that existed prior to 12 February 1992 are passed through to the pool owners.</PARA>
<PARA>If we take that on face value&mdash;of course, everyone is entitled to believe those words&mdash;we assume that the Government's intention is that people who built concrete pools after the operative date in 1986 and before the High Court decision in February 1992 will get their money back. But, when we look at the mechanics of the legislation, we find that that is not so. We must ask what people are asking: what is the Government's intention? It says in the Budget Papers that people will get their money back. In practice we now find that very few of them will get their money back. I suppose that at worst we could take the view that as a deliberate act on the part of the Government it designed this legislation so that people would not get their money back, and that the Government would hang onto&mdash;and I can tell honourable members that it will hang onto, if it proceeds with this legislation&mdash;most of the $50m-odd that we are talking about. It is $50m that it should not have got in the first place; the people who paid it deserve to have it back. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), when he speaks after me, to refute my argument that they will not get their money back under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preceding paragraph we are warned that the Government will introduce a 20 per cent tax on swimming pool shells constructed in situ in future. The Treasurer said in his speech that the new tax will apply prospectively from a date to be specified when relevant legislation is introduced. I have written to the Treasurer asking him to confirm that he meant prospectively, because that is what he said in his speech and that is what appeared in the Budget Papers. So the assumption is that people who are currently having in-ground pools built will not be subject to sales tax and that, when the legislation finally hits the deck, it will prescribe some introduction date. I am asking for confirmation of that because I do not trust the Treasurer to introduce it prospectively. Here it is quite clear that the Government intends to ensure that people who built pools between 1986 and 1992 receive refunds of sales tax. But, as I have said, I challenge Government speakers to confirm that this will be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the Bill and I am telling the honourable member that it does not achieve the desired effect. I have no problem with what the Government is trying to do. Because it was caught out with $50m of taxpayer's money that it should not have, it was obliged to give it back. I am saying that the mechanism that the Government has devised for giving it back is completely flawed. I think blind Freddy could see that. I am sure that the honourable member for Brisbane is intelligent enough to know, and he acknowledged in a back-handed way a little while ago, that there were some problems. The legislation is totally inadequate. It really reflects very badly on this Government that it should be introduced in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has an amendment which deals with one particular little nicety of this legislation, namely, the Government's apparent reneging on an arrangement that was made between the Taxation Office and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association. Even by this Government's standards, this is a particularly nasty little back-handed act. The Swimming Pool and Spa Association was successful in getting the Taxation Office to agree that, if it were successful in its legal action in the High Court, then the money from 1990 to February 1992 would be refunded. Even as recently as 28 July 1992, the Taxation Office in writing to the firm of accountants which represented the Swimming Pool and Spa Association, confirmed that this arrangement remains in place. The letter from the regional co-ordinator of sales tax in the south-western region states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that this Office has now had the opportunity to consider legal opinion in relation to the agreement between SPASA and the Taxation Office and our view is that we may properly act upon the principles embodied in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>That was until the Government stepped in and said that it was not on; it was not going to give the money away so easily. This is retrospective taxation of the worst type. It is not easy to get the Taxation Office at the best of times to enter into a perfectly reasonable arrangement like that, but it did. Now the Government wants to renege on that particular agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment addresses that issue, and I support it strongly. If the Government is not of a mind to support that amendment, then I expect that the Opposition will oppose the whole of this legislation. It will not be because we do not believe people should get their money back&mdash;we do&mdash;but because the methodology in this legislation is totally and completely flawed. As has already been stated, we are particularly concerned about the Government reneging on that agreement, and that is the purpose of our amendment. If the Government is not of a mind to withdraw this legislation and to fix it by doing the job properly that it should have done, then I hope the Opposition in the Senate will be successful in having the matter referred to a committee for detailed consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I have many constituents waiting for a refund, particularly now they have become aware of the High Court decision, I am concerned that this matter be expedited. I hope there is no reason for holding it up. I believe that the Government should act in good faith and return this money properly as soon as possible. I think we all agree that it is a complex matter. I do not pretend that it is a simple matter. I sympathise with the Government in dealing with the complexities, but I simply make the point that what it proposes to do is wrong; it is not going to achieve the objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition could fix the legislation for the Government by moving a whole raft of amendments but we simply do not believe it is our job to do that. It is the responsibility of the Government to bring legislation into this place which, if passed, would work. What we have been presented with here does not achieve that objective at all. The Government should be presenting us with understandable and workable legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Picking up the point the honourable member for Brisbane made earlier: the Government's suggestion that pool builders should refund the money to their clients and then apply for a refund from the Tax Office is quite absurd in itself. One pool builder told me that if he were to go down that track he would have to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars. He would then have to make the refunds to his clients and then he would have to apply to the Taxation Office. Goodness knows, knowing the Taxation Office, how long he would have to wait to get his money back; it might be six or 12 months. What sort of an expectation is that for a small business person? It is totally unreal, and yet that is exactly what this legislation proposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we can see some difficulty for the Government in having to deal individually with thousands of pool owners. However, there is a reasonable mechanism by which this could be achieved, and I will give the Government a few clues. I imagine many pool owners would be quite happy to complete a form and to accept a reasonable assessment of the sales tax paid based on the price of the pool. There are numerous documents available to substantiate these figures. I notice the Government was very quick to write to owners of pools reminding them of their responsibilities under the prescribed payment system. The Government based this on advice it received from all local government authorities of construction projects exceeding $10,000 in value, and that included most swimming pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major anomaly which the honourable member for Brisbane touched upon is that many pool businesses have gone out of business. His answer to that is too bad. Since 1986 many pool builders have gone out of business on the Gold Coast, yet the mechanism the Government now proposes means that people who had pools built by builders who have gone out of business cannot get a refund. I put it to those opposite that that would be perhaps 75 per cent of people who have had pools built. This legislation is wrong; it is seriously flawed. I ask the Government to go back to the drawing board and fix the legislation. I think it is a disgrace that it should present for debate in this House such a totally deficient piece of legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992 and cognate Bill earlier today and this evening, it is certainly fair to say that we have traversed many issues that have moved further than perhaps the couple of measures that are before us tonight would normally permit. When we discuss questions relating to wholesale sales tax, I think it is relevant to consider the tax implications of measures that the Opposition is proffering to the community. The Opposition continually lambasts the Government about the wholesale sales tax which raises of the order of $9 billion. It is worth noting that, in the place of that tax, the Opposition has this manic desire to introduce a $27 billion tax, the goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, in respect of particular measures&mdash;the tax relating to the swimming pool arrangement and also the environmental tax on recycled paper&mdash;that the Government's arrangements do allow the flexibility to deal with issues relating to the administration of those taxes, whereas the goods and services tax, as we know, is that very blunt instrument that the Opposition would seek to use which, most significantly of all, has the value added element, which is the counterproductive element in that whole tax because it has a disincentive on value adding, on industry development and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 0.5 per cent of the amount raised in the wholesale sales tax area goes to administration, yet commentators from around the world who analyse the goods and services tax&mdash;the Canadian experience is an excellent one&mdash;highlight repeatedly the complexity and the fact that businesses all over the country are turned into agencies of the Tax Office under the goods and services tax arrangement. That becomes detrimental, time consuming and bureaucratic and is a disincentive to business, particularly as we get into the services area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about matters relating to taxation, but when we get into the services area, which the Opposition has said in Fightback it would try to zero rate, it is very difficult, as it has established an agenda on those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer first to the changes proposed with recycled paper. There has been understandable concern for many in the community about the implications of this particular change, but it is important to note that a number of key areas relating to paper products remain exempt; for example, writing and drawing paper, pads of writing or drawing paper, paper for use in accounting ledgers and journals, and envelopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recognised the necessity to adapt the wholesale sales tax to meet the difficulties that have been highlighted in the way the original arrangements were imposed. At the same time it has continued to provide incentives for the recycling industry to develop in this country. It is an industry that needs nurturing because it is showing considerable potential. There is the capacity to make changes in the wholesale sales tax in a way which is productive and which provides encouragement for the industries concerned. But when one comes to the 15 per cent goods and services tax, one sees that the net effect of the $27 billion tax arrangement is totally detrimental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) indicated that the wholesale sales tax was a government tax by stealth. I am reminded that in 1975 the then Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, talked about taxation by stealth and promised that under his administration the tax brackets would be indexed. However, he did not take such action immediately, but waited until 1977. Lo and behold, he made the decision to index the tax scales just before the 1977 election but abandoned the practice straight afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be a concern about the tax arrangements, but one can say with a degree of certainty that the wholesale sales tax revenue raising has nothing like the same effect when compared with the $27 billion goods and services tax proposal. When one looks at the range of environmental services that we are dealing with here and the encouragement to the industries we are dealing with tonight in terms of wholesale sales tax and contrasts them with the devastating effect that the goods and services tax would have in this area, one can see the Government's capacity to adapt to those changing requirements and to respond to industry concerns where they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the taxation arrangements and the way industry views policies of this sort, it is interesting to note the sort of debate that is going on about industry policy issues generally. There are matters that all have witnessed in recent days which show that industry is increasingly concerned about the Opposition's agenda in those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the question of in-ground pools with which the honourable member for McPherson dealt in his remarks. I have to say he raised issues which even a basic reading of the Bill would suggest have been addressed. The effect of the Bill is made clear in the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin). It is appropriate that the Government is honouring the commitment to ensure that the High Court decision is picked up and followed. At the same time we want to ensure that the benefit of any refunds flow back to the pool owners, the people who have paid and made the investment. There are probably two or three ways in which that could be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, what matters in this whole process is that the people who own the pools, who have received the tax bill and have to pick up the cost receive the benefits of the refund. This Bill makes clear that this is the Government's approach. The explanatory memorandum states that the effect of this Bill is not to deny the Commonwealth's liability to refund amounts paid as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, but rather to place a condition on the eligibility of pool builders to a refund by requiring that if the amount paid as sales tax was passed on to the purchaser the refund must be passed on as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also provide for the payment of interest to pool builders as compensation for any period that they are out of pocket as a result of these amendments. Indeed, the very point that the honourable member for McPherson was suggesting had not been accommodated is contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the honourable member for McPherson said that the Government should act promptly because it was wrong to delay a refund to pool owners. But then in the next breath he suggested that the matter should be sent to a Senate committee for review. If one is looking for prompt action, I think reference of the matter to a Senate committee would not have the effect of the taking of prompt action to enable a refund to flow through to the pool owners. Such a move would be counterproductive because it would take significantly more time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of the honourable member's proposal would be delay for the very people for whom the honourable member is an advocate and for whom he is seeking justice. I think we can take it as a fairly shallow gesture that leaves a great deal left unsaid. It is suggesting that the basic provisions of the Bill do not achieve what the Bill says. That is certainly a novel approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth coming back to the basic point in terms of the difference between the wholesale sales tax and the goods and services tax proposal. Indeed, earlier tonight the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spent 20 minutes talking on these issues without mentioning wholesale sales tax once&mdash;quite an achievement. Certainly school children get value out of the encouragement of recycled products. They spend a lot of time learning about and encouraging the use of recycled products such as paper, and develop a lot of innovative projects in that regard. Many students attend places where they learn more about the values of recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation contains measures that continue to maintain the Government's commitment towards recycling. But under the Opposition's proposal students who go on a school excursion to learn about recycling not only will have to pay taxes on the food and other items they purchase, but their families will face the impost of an additional 15 per cent for the cost of the school excursion and all the other ancillary things. The Opposition is even having trouble working out the zero rating of education services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that all the additional services that families have to provide in the education of students&mdash;in learning about recycling, or in other aspects of the environmental opportunities that exist for schools&mdash;would be subject to the Opposition's 15 per cent goods and services tax. That tax highlights just how intrusive, how blunt and how unfair it would be on those who are least able to meet those sorts of costs. That is really the fundamental thrust of the whole of the goods and services tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of the $27 billion tax that the Opposition seeks to impose, as most studies are starting to highlight, will be a dilemma for people who are unable to provide for basic necessities such as food, clothing, school excursions, and wreaths for Anzac Day. All these items will be subject to the 15 per cent tax. The Opposition never wants to talk about the key services that it intends to tax, with all the value added aspects of those taxation arrangements. Nobody should doubt the highly intrusive, highly unfair aspects of that $27 billion tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members talk of tax by stealth and whether people can trust the Government in tax matters. But the people of Australia only have to go back to the taxation record of the Fraser Government to see the true position. People remember its broken promises, the fistful of dollars campaign pursued by that Government, and they know just how phoney many of those campaigns were. One contrasts those campaigns with these arrangements aimed at encouraging the use of recycled paper products. If difficulties are experienced with aspects of those products, the Government will be able to respond through the wholesale sales tax arrangements to ensure that appropriate action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons people, increasingly, will start to recognise that the debate which is developing about taxation is not just a debate about these couple of measures before us tonight. It is fundamentally a debate about whether people want to have a 15 per cent tax imposed on all of those basics&mdash;food, including meat and fruit&mdash;and all of the services that are provided by businesses across Australia. Will business accept that every business across the land should become a branch of the Tax Office? Is that sort of administrative nightmare and monster the sort of thing that Australians really want? I do not think it is and, increasingly, I think we will see the sorts of results in polls that we are seeing now because of the Opposition's mistakes in other areas in relation to tariffs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point we come back to the fact that we need to ensure at all times that the wholesale sales tax arrangements work and provide the flexibility, stimulus and value adding to products such as recycled paper so that we can help those industries to develop. At the same time, we are concerned when there are suggestions that some of the products which people might have tried to fit into those definitions do not meet the sorts of quality controls that we would accept and, therefore, there are implications for our Australian industry. We are conscious of the need to protect and develop Australian industry, so we have introduced measures to ensure that the security of those provisions is encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we have done in the case of recycled paper; that is exactly the approach we have taken in that area. Industry expressed concerns about the application of those arrangements and so the Government has been able to adapt the wholesale sales tax to take account of that. If we get to the stage of saying that we will not try to encourage industry and we will treat every product the same&mdash;be it a recycled or conventional product&mdash;the Government will never be able to provide a cost incentive which will encourage the development of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely the Opposition's approach with its 15 per cent goods and services tax. Those opposite do not care; indeed, it is pretty clear that they do not care about our industry generally. They do not care whether industry in those areas stays; they do not care whether we have an automotive industry. But I think it is reasonable for the Government to develop strategies which say that those industries and the development of those industry arrangements do matter. The continuation of elements of the wholesale sales tax arrangements which are relevant to paper products highlights the fact that the Government is conscious of the need to continue to lead in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the two measures which is before us has obviously come about as a result of the High Court of Australia decision. The Government has had to respond to that and I think the arrangements which have been outlined are fair. The Government is introducing and proceeding with the measures and is not seeking to hold up the matters in the Senate&mdash;what Opposition speakers have requested as far as those measures are concerned would be counterproductive&mdash;and I think that is the appropriate way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come back to the fundamental thrust of the whole debate on these two Bills: do the people of Australia really want a $27 billion tax which does not pay for the personal income tax cuts which have been talked about tonight? Everybody knows that that is a nonsense. It does not pay for those things. The Opposition's income tax proposals are largely unfunded at this stage. The only way they will be funded is by a massive and draconian attack on the living standards of ordinary people and a massive and draconian cut in public expenditure. That is the only way those opposite can pay for their income tax cut proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This $27 billion goods and services tax will make every business in Australia a branch of the Tax Office. It will add huge administrative costs. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has sent a letter to the Cole committee saying, `Look, you try to sort it out for us; it's all a bit complex for us'. That committee has come back and said, `You've got to make some pretty hard decisions about things such as artificial limbs, wheelchairs and all the rest of it'. That just highlights what a disgraceful tax it is and what a severe burden it would be on the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons it would be better to refine and develop the wholesale sales tax arrangements and the other tax reforms which the Government proposes without introducing a goods and services tax. They will be fairer. Certainly for the majority of Australians who do not drive Ferraris or have the luxuries that some in the Opposition seem to think are so crucial, the tax arrangements which the Government has outlined and which will introduce personal income tax without the goods and services tax are far more equitable and far more achievable than the Opposition's proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address my remarks principally to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992. At the outset, in my view this Bill accomplishes two objectives. Firstly, it attempts&mdash;and I emphasise the word `attempts'&mdash;to deal with inequities caused to pool owners and pool builders by this Government's imposition of a sales tax on in-ground concrete swimming pool shells in 1986. The second thing this Bill accomplishes is it certainly exposes the absolute hypocrisy of this Government in persisting with a ramshackle, iniquitous, inefficient and regressive wholesale sales tax, while arguing against a fairer and simpler broad-based goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, this Bill was brought to my attention by Frank and Kay Morden, who are constituents of mine and who own and operate a swimming pool company in the State of Victoria which is known as Natural Swimming Pools. My constituents build a terrific swimming pool. In saying that, I also have to declare a pecuniary interest in this Bill because between 1986 and 1990 I hired the services of Natural Swimming Pools to build a concrete swimming pool for my family on my property. Therefore, I expect that some time in the future some refund of wholesale sales tax will be due to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue concerns the inequities which have been dealt to pool owners and pool builders by this Government's attempting to broaden the base of the wholesale sales tax. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill is interesting. Item 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sales tax law was amended in 1986 to overcome an anomaly in the sales tax treatment of swimming pools . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That anomaly was brought about by the fact that sales tax was imposed originally on above-ground swimming pools at a rate of 10 per cent. Later it was decided that fibreglass swimming pool shells should be added to the tax base and that it was unfair for them to be provided to owners without them paying their share of the wholesale sales tax. But initially no-one could figure out how to go about taxing concrete in-ground swimming pools. It is pretty easy to understand why they could not figure out how to do it. Wholesale sales tax is imposed at the wholesale level on goods; it is not imposed on services and, theoretically, it is not imposed on labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody knows that materials supplied to the building industry have always been free of wholesale sales tax because it was too complicated to figure out how to tax them. In the case of swimming pools, the Government decided it would be very clever and make the swimming pool tax equitable for everybody. So it upped the rate from 10 per cent to 20 per cent and added concrete shells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it forgot about the fact that nobody knew exactly how to price a concrete shell&mdash;did it include the excavation of the dirt; did it include the surrounds; did it include the reinforcing that stuck out of the shell and was turned at right angles in order to support the concrete surrounds; and did it include the tiles that went on the surrounds or the tiles in the pool? Was it completely separate and could one divorce oneself from the fibreglass or plastic components which went into the pool in terms of the skimmer box and the outlet valves? All of these questions became very difficult to answer. Sub-trades were involved and pricing changed&mdash;it really was a most complex matter. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amounts paid by pool builders in relation to in situ pools following the 1986 amendments are not taxed and it is not clear whether the refund provisions of the sales tax law apply to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only did the Government get it wrong in trying to apply a sales tax to a construction activity, but now it does not know how to get out of problem that it has created. In collecting a tax that was not a tax, it now does not know how to apply the law in order to refund the tax that was not a tax, if honourable members follow me. The explanatory memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will ensure, in line with the existing sales tax refund code, that the benefit of any refund payable as a result of the High Court decision goes to the person who bore the `tax' (usually the pool purchaser).</PARA>
<PARA>That is very good, and so it should be. If the pool purchaser, the pool owner, paid the tax, he or she should receive the refund. But, as I will describe later in my discussions tonight, there are quite a number of pool owners who, under this legislation, have no chance of ever achieving a refund. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also ensure that a pool builder who refunds an amount to a pool purchaser is not out of pocket.</PARA>
<PARA>Boy, we certainly wish that were true. It is not true, by the way. There are many items at the pool builders' expense which this Bill does not address. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will not be liable to make a refund of an amount paid as sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ unless the Commissioner receives a declaration from the pool builder that the amount paid was not passed on to the pool purchaser, or if an amount was passed on, that that amount has been refunded to the pool purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA>That all sounds very good in theory and one wishes that it would work, but the Bill falls short on a number of aspects. The Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February of this year the High Court of Australia found amendments made by the Parliament in 1986 in relation to these pools to be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An unfortunate effect of the decision, however, is that pool builders, who were able to pass on to purchasers any amounts payable to the Commissioner of Taxation as sales tax . . . may have been able to get the benefit of refunds payable by the Commonwealth as windfall gains.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill certainly makes sure that the pool builders will not receive any windfall gains. I suspect there will not be any indication from the Minister as to the amount that is expected to be refunded to pool builders and to pool owners under this Bill. I suspect that we will find that it is many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Albeit that the industry today is in a distressed state because of the recession, during the earlier years of the imposition of this tax on industry there was a great deal of activity in the pool building sphere. A solicitor who works for one of my constituents wrote an article that described this whole fiasco. I would like to read a portion of that tonight. He titled his article `Taxation in a Totalitarian State'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time there was a bad tax. The time was 1986 and the tax was the wholesale sales tax introduced upon inground pools constructed on site . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It represented a new field of sales tax because for the first time the tax was not imposed on goods, as compared to tax which had existed for several years on the sale by the manufacturer of a fibreglass pool shell. A concrete pool constructed on site was `deemed' to be goods for the purpose of tax and a complicated method of calculating the value was set out, which included construction materials and labour as well as profit and overhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years later the High Court ruled that this was not a legal tax at all and, for technical reasons under the constitution, the provisions imposing the tax were of no effect. However, it is convenient to still refer to it as a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxing concrete swimming pools is not in principle a bad thing of itself, but this particular sales tax was bad because it was impossible to fairly administer and enforce. The artificial deeming provisions caused a tremendous amount of confusion and uncertainty as to how to apply the tax, a great deal of error in understatement or overstatement of the tax payable and, as time went on, a vast amount of deliberate avoidance. The Taxation Office proved incapable of developing an effective system to supervise or enforce the tax and lacked the resources to police it to any worthwhile extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swimming pool industry comprises a very large number of small contractors, a few medium sized businesses, but no large or public companies are in the construction field for concrete pools. Fibreglass manufacture is carried out by a much smaller number of larger companies. Fibreglass and concrete pool suppliers compete in the same market for inground pools. The tax was set at 20% on the manufactured cost of the fibreglass shell as against 20% of the construction value of the inground concrete pool. Effectively this meant that for a pool costing the same retail price to the customer, nearly twice as much tax was paid on a concrete pool as on the fibreglass shell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The years immediately following the introduction of the tax&mdash;1987, 1988 and 1989&mdash;were relatively prosperous for the pool industry with the economy showing good growth and plenty of money available for consumer spending&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the banks have paid the price for that, have they not?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This enabled them to maintain sales figures at reasonably good levels despite the extra cost of the tax. But gradually dis-satisfaction with the tax became widespread throughout the reputable section of the industry. These builders, including most of the larger specialist contractors, who were acting ethically by making an honest attempt to calculate tax supposedly payable and remitting it by monthly returns to the Taxation Office, became concerned and frustrated at non-payment by a large number of other, mainly smaller and non-specialist pool contractors installing inground concrete pools, as well as by the competitive disadvantage imposed by the tax as against fibreglass pools. Many complaints were made to the Taxation Office about the system and the avoidance, and information supplied to the office where it could be obtained, but almost always without any tangible result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main avenues of avoidance was the artificial use of the exemption provided in the Act for an `owner-builder'. Prior to 1986 figures supplied in regard to local government approvals of swimming pools showed that owner-builders represented less than 2% of total approved pools. The definition of an owner-builder in the Act was very tight, so much so that no ordinary home owner could qualify. Nevertheless by 1990 the percentage of approved pools by `owner-builders' in N.S.W. had risen to over 30% of all pools approved by the councils. It was well known throughout the industry that there were many builders who were not paying tax on the basis that their customers adopted a fictional `owner-builder' status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1990 therefore, avoidance of tax by this one method, out of many, accounted for about one-third of all pools built. Other methods were also widespread and, although no accurate figures can be obtained, it was commonly believed throughout the industry that tax was not being paid on well over half the concrete inground pools built in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that in this situation the ethical, tax-paying builders sought relief. Most of them are members of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia Limited (SPASA) and on their behalf SPASA engaged professional advisers, being sales tax specialists with a large accounting firm. They made representations on behalf of SPASA members to both Taxation Office and treasury officials for the removal or easing of the tax burden, but without success. Thus began the search for other answers to the problem which resulted in the legal challenge to the constitutional validity of the tax law, which was commenced by High Court proceedings in August 1990. In February 1992 the High Court delivered judgment agreeing with the SPASA members' contention that the so-called tax on inground concrete pools constructed on site had never legally come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA>We face three issues with this Bill: the first dealing with pool builders since July 1990; the second, pool owners from 1986 through June of 1990; and the third, pool builders from 1986 through June 1990. In relation to the first issue, when the pool builders filed their High Court challenge they eventually received from the Commissioner of Taxation agreement that, if the High Court challenge were successful, all moneys paid by pool companies from July 1990 into a special fund and then forwarded on to the Government would be refunded to the pool companies together with interest. But this Bill obviates that agreement by the Tax Office to refund legally due moneys to the construction companies since July 1990, since they mounted the High Court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill makes no mention of the overheads that pool companies have had to expend in order to collect tax, to pay tax or now to recover tax. There is a differential in interest under this Bill in that, particularly in this period from 1990 onwards, the Government is due to pay interest to the companies for the time that, under the Constitution, the Government has had the money illegally. But that interest will not be at commercial rates. As I said before, it will not cover overheads. Interest which may ultimately be refundable to pool owners in the period prior to 1990 will not cover the pool companies' costs of interest when claiming their refunds from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not make clear how the pool companies are to prove that they have not passed on any sales tax since the 1990 High Court challenge, so that the onus of proof will be on the pool companies notwithstanding the fact that the Taxation Office clearly made an agreement with the companies to refund the tax if it lost the High Court challenge. Legal expenses in mounting the claim have been ignored, as have Association levies associated with the High Court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should be aware of the Opposition amendment proposed earlier in this debate which, firstly, will remove from the Bill the section of time from 1990 onwards so that the Tax Office will be required immediately to refund to the pool companies the money it has collected illegally since August 1990. For the period from 1986 until June-July 1990, pool owners are due refunds, but the Government's proposals for making those refunds means that thousands of pool owners will not receive refunds and the basis on which the remainder do receive them will surely be open to question. I am informed that many owners are expecting a refund of 20 per cent of the value of their contract with the pool company. Clearly, that will not be on. The Association itself has estimated that the amount of refund will be more in the order of 7 per cent, but each individual contract will have to be examined and the records will have to be looked at all the way back to 1986 to determine the amount of rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many pool builders are no longer in business. This Government's mother of all recessions, the greatest recession-depression for 60 years, has meant that many pool builders who were in business in 1986-87 are no longer with us today. Under this Bill, who is going to file with the Government on behalf of the owners of those pools? Obviously, no-one. The Bill should go to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation so it can work out a mechanism, particularly for those owners who are disadvantaged by the fact that they no longer have a pool company to deal through in respect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The builders are going to be required to borrow funds. My constituent, Natural Swimming Pools, will have to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars at today's going market rates in order to refund its clients and then wait until it receives a reimbursement from the Federal Government. It is concerned that banks will not be willing to lend it the hundreds of thousands of dollars that will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) said that referring this Bill to the Senate Committee would be unjust because of the time it would involve. I maintain that we had better get it right, because this Government messed everything up by trying to impose the tax in the first place, and now it is going to further compound the problem with this Bill, trying to get itself out of an agreement made by the Commissioner of Taxation. This Bill does not deal equitably with the many hundreds of thousands of pool owners who are due refunds but may not be able to get them due to the constraints of this Bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992 are both important illustrations of the complexity of the existing and very old-fashioned sales tax system that we have in Australia and the enormous range of anomalies that inevitably flow from a system which is absolutely replete with exemptions and yet is designed to be a system of collecting taxation in order to finance the processes of government. Indeed, I would have thought that in both of these Bills we have the absolutely ideal case for reforming the sales tax system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is enormously disappointing that, ever since 1985, when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) argued so strongly for the present 1930s sales tax system to be abolished and to be replaced with a completely different type of system, which nowadays is called GST in Australian terms, we really have not made any progress in this area. Some time ago the Government introduced its new, broader sales tax initiative to try to simplify the sales tax system. That so-called simplification process has proved to be little short of chaotic, has required enormous redrafting and has added literally hundreds of pages to the existing sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the package before us tonight is the relationship of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill to environment policy. Prima facie, the original sales tax exemption was about pursuing the responsible environmental objective of trying to encourage the process of recycling, and to do that through changes to the sales tax system. But that very process inevitably raises as many questions as it answers, or perhaps I should say it raises more questions than it answers. We have before us tonight an amendment Bill to that original 1989 legislation because the 1989 legislation did not work. The fact is that the amending legislation is creating as many anomalies as did the original 1989 legislation. It simply makes the point, which I think one could describe as an intellectual point, that the more we provide exemptions from sales taxes in direct taxes of this kind the more problems we create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the idea here was to encourage the process of recycling because, on the face of it, that was environmentally responsible. But the amendment does not take into consideration the very real question of whether all recycling is automatically environmentally responsible. What does `environmentally responsible' mean? `Environmentally responsible' must surely mean the most efficient use of, in this context, non-renewable resources. We want to maximise the use of non-renewable resources so that we do not diminish those resources at a greater rate than we need to, so we conserve them and that has some logical and seemingly satisfactory consequences. But the problem is: does all recycling achieve that objective? This is just a detailed amendment to try to rectify some anomalies in the 1989 exemption, but it does not solve this particular problem. The problem with this exemption is that we are still encouraging a process of recycling for the sake of recycling, not encouraging recycling which is by definition environmentally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall that some time ago the Industry Commission produced a very interesting report on the whole issue of recycling. One of the conclusions of the Industry Commission report was that recycling sometimes could actually utilise more non-renewable resources than the process of continuing to make goods from virgin products. For example, the process of collecting the used product which will then be recycled obviously uses a substantial amount of fuel and a substantial amount of labour. Locations to place all the collected material have to be found before one can enter into the process of recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to recycling newsprint, for example, the newsprint has to be cleaned and de-inked. In those sorts of processes an enormous quantity of resources are used, including non-renewable resources. Once the so-called recycled product is completely manufactured and ready for sale, one has to add up whether the quantity of non-renewable resources used in that process of recycling is not greater than the quantity of non-renewable resources used had that product been made from virgin products. For example, it has been argued that newspaper recycling is indeed environmentally unfriendly simply because of the enormous number of resources needed in that process. It also raises questions of disposal of the by-products that flow inevitably from recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued by some, and others dispute this, that recycling bottles is an environmentally unfriendly practice. The bottles have to be collected, cleaned and then reused. It is through the process of collection and cleaning that more environmental problems are created than are resolved. At the end of the day, the net result of that recycling process is environmentally unfriendly. It raises the question as to whether giving so-called sales tax exemptions achieves the rather simplistic and populist objective that a government, in making those exemptions, sets out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, during 1989 the then Minister for the Environment, Senator Richardson&mdash;he was really only interested in collecting votes; he was not a man who made any contribution to the Government or to this Parliament in terms of objective improvement to the state of the nation&mdash;originally introduced this legislation to try to win the preferences of so-called `greens' for the 1990 election. I suppose one could argue that the Government was successful in achieving that objective, but it has created an enormous number of anomalies in the national interest. It is quite arguable that encouraging recycling in certain areas has improved the overall quality of our environment and the preservation of non-renewable resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the specifics of the Bill. The Bill changes very substantially the whole concept of exemption from the tax. It taxes goods described as wholly recycled fibre, which includes books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing. When one receives letters from environmentally sensitive politicians and others one notices that at the bottom, in very small print, there is the boast that the paper is recycled paper. As I said, that does not prove that it is an environmentally friendly type of paper. This legislation removes the exemption that used to apply to that type of paper, and it will now be subject to sales tax. It is an example, if you like, of the Labor Government yet again introducing more sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation removes the exemption from toilet tissue, facial tissues and paper bags marketed for household purposes or for use in marketing goods sold by the retail sector. It does leave some exemptions: writing paper&mdash;I suppose that is the sort of paper I mentioned that one gets from members of parliament and the like&mdash;drawing paper, pads of writing and drawing paper, and paper for use in accounting ledgers and journals. Books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing are now subject to sales tax, but writing and drawing paper and pads of writing and drawing paper remain exempt from the sales tax. In the broad sweep of the issue one wonders whether very much has been achieved; in fact, the Government is creating an anomaly where it has tried to rid itself of one before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Industry Commission&mdash;I think all members of this House treat it with a good deal of respect; the handful who do not really ought to&mdash;criticised this legislation in report No. 2 of 1990 by saying that it was distorting and that it failed to encourage efficient paper recycling. I guess that is the point that I have been making. The Industry Commission made the point, and I think this legislation is designed to address it, that it is just simply impossible to prove whether products are made of 100 per cent recycled paper. That is especially the case in relation to imported products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Industry Commission report No. 6 recommended that the exemption for recycled paper products be abolished altogether. It made that recommendation on the basis of the arguments that I have put to the House tonight. One of the arguments against providing these exemptions is that some people will, inevitably, be helped, but others will be disadvantaged. Obviously businesses which suddenly find themselves subject to sales tax&mdash;prior to the legislation they were not&mdash;will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this amendment Bill, the whole game has been changed around yet again. In 1989 businesses found that they were suddenly exempt from the sales tax. With this Bill they now find that they will be subject to the sales tax. That works the other way around: in a competitive marketplace some businesses will be substantially disadvantaged by remaining exempt, while some of their competitors will be subject to the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, if we think about whether environmental objectives have been achieved through these types of exemptions&mdash;and the contestability of that argument is supported by the Industry Commission&mdash;and, secondly, if we consider that some businesses will benefit by changes to the tax in this way and that other businesses will be disadvantaged, we see that the end result of the whole debate is almost total confusion. There may be political advantage for those who argue for these types of exemptions because they can pretend to a public, which has not had the benefit of reading Industry Commission reports and analysing the true economics and the environmental implications of these issues, that they are being environmentally responsible. But the consequence of what they are doing is not necessarily that. It will also provide a great number of business advantages and disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting to quote a man called John Pedler who runs a company called Austissue which has a particular interest in this subject. Recently to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, we are saying that it is the Government's right and duty to set an appropriate framework for business people to take their risks or choose not to take their risks, whatever the case may be. The Government set a framework. We set off in a particular direction, dictated by that framework and all of a sudden one day we woke up and found that yesterday someone had changed the rules.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, that is the most damning indictment of this type of process and the implications that it has for business in Australia, setting aside the arguments about the environment which I have canvassed at some length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contrasts with what I would describe as the intelligent and simple approach that the coalition has taken to these sorts of issues. We have argued that what we need to make business succeed in this country, and therefore to create jobs, is a system, including a tax system, which is totally predictable. Again, this is a point that Mr Pedler made in his submission to the Senate Committee. He argues, as we could expect, for this whole concept of predictability. But this shambles of legislation underlines, I think very dramatically, that the case for abolishing the existing 1930s sales tax system could not be more overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our sales tax system today is riddled with anomalies. I have been through some of them in relation to this legislation. When we think, for example, that toilet paper, as long as it is not recycled paper, is subject to a 20 per cent sales tax, and newspapers are exempt altogether from sales tax, what does that tell us about the Labor Government's priorities? What social message is that transmitting to Australians? I blush to think about it. What is the message that a government is transmitting to Australians when it says it will not tax <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mayfair</EMPHASIS> and those sorts of magazines? Mr Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate that I do not know the names of them. I can remember only one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the sense in having a 10 or 20 per cent tax on children's toys? What is the message that the Government is transmitting when it says it will not tax pornography, but that it will tax children's toys? What is the sense in saying to people who go on a holiday that they have to pay a 20 per cent sales tax to buy their caravan, and now a 15 per cent sales tax to buy their motor vehicle&mdash;and 26c tax per litre on the fuel that they use, which I accept is not sales tax but fuel excise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is saying that somebody like that has to pay all those taxes to go on a holiday, compared with the big high roller who can catch an Australian Airlines flight up to Cairns and spend a week at the Sheraton Mirage at enormous expense&mdash;$200, $300, $400 or $500 a night&mdash;and not pay any sales tax. What is the sense of that? Where is the social justice which the Labor Party loves to talk about? The fact is that I think any intelligent and objective observer of this debate would recognise that such justice simply does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax system, too, is a system which is reflected in the cost of business. The retailer whose shop is absolutely full of products subject to sales tax has to bear the cost of that sales tax until such time as he is lucky enough to sell the goods. If it takes the retailer six or 12 months to sell some of the goods on his or her shelf, then that retailer simply has to bear the cost of that sales tax until the point of sale finally arrives. What is the sense in loading retailers up with those additional and unnecessary costs when we could scrap that system and have a system that ensures that the retailer gets any indirect tax paid on purchases fully refunded very quickly? What is the sense of having a sales tax system which simply adds to the cost of our exports and disadvantages our domestic industries&mdash;in other words, our sales to the domestic markets vis-a-vis the sales by importers to our domestic markets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifty-nine countries have what we in Australia call a GST regime. Some countries call it a VAT and other sorts of names, depending on the language they speak in those countries. But 59 of those countries are exporting to Australia, selling in Australia, with absolutely no sales tax at all built into the costs of the production and distribution of whatever they are selling in Australia. Those importers are competing with the poor Australian suckers who are providing jobs for Australians who are loaded up with all these sales taxes, largely indirectly affecting the cost of their production. What is the commonsense in having a sales tax system such as that? This is 1992. Just about every single country has scrapped this old-style 1930s sales tax system, and we are still left with a system of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, I think for the first time in Australian political history, offers an opportunity to change the indirect tax system in this country, to make it equitable across the board, to rid it of all these half crazed anomalies that we are debating tonight and the others which I mentioned. It gets rid of the additional cost to businesses which results from sales tax. It gets rid of any sales tax effect on exports&mdash;the GST does not apply to exports&mdash;and it makes sure that all imports are subject to a GST. </PARA>

If honourable members can tell me what the logic is behind taxing books of blank paper or lined paper and exempting pads of writing paper and drawing paper, they are better people than I am, because when it all comes down to it, it is paper that we write on. There seems to be no logic in taxing one and not the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that all this legislation will do is create further distortions. It really does not encourage efficient paper recycling. It will be very hard, if not impossible in some cases, to police. In many cases it will be very hard to check out those who claim that their product is 100 per cent recycled paper for the purposes of getting an exemption. Therefore, I think that all we have done is created the possibility of a further rort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this legislation seems to do is epitomise the complexity and confusion of the present wholesale sales tax system and also the adhockery of it. Australian Pulp and Paper Mills says that if this legislation does not go through it could shed up to 44 employees. On the other hand, Austissue Pty Ltd says that it has invested $7m to take advantage of the current sales tax exemptions, and claims that it will have to lay off 40 staff if this Bill goes through. Nothing could highlight more the ridiculousness of the situation that we are in today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present state of the sales tax legislation in this country today is that we have five different levels. We have levels at zero per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. I suppose most people, even though they do not know what item goes into what particular level, nevertheless believe that there is some logical reason behind all this. They tend to think that luxury items go into the higher levels and the staples of life go into the zero levels, but that is not true either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that jewellery, for example, goes into the 30 per cent level of sales tax, but we also have commonplace items, such as the wristwatch on my wrist or the clock radio I turn on in the morning to hear the market reports or the news, taxed at 30 per cent. On the other hand, items such as caviar and pornographic magazines are taxed at zero per cent. Anyone who can tell me the logic behind that is a better person than I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children's toys and school exercise books are taxed at 20 per cent; ornaments are taxed at different levels from souvenirs; highlighters are taxed at different levels from pens and pencils; sugar coated peanuts are taxed at different levels from chocolate coated peanuts; and, in the most ridiculous example of all, chocolate Quik is taxed at a different level from strawberry Quik. So it goes on. The legislation we are debating tonight seems to be a continuation of that. For example, books of blank paper are taxed at one level and pads of paper are taxed at another level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) took over in 1983 as Treasurer, he was collecting a total of about $3 1/2 billion of sales tax. Today he is collecting close to $10 1/2 billion of sales tax, which is a threefold increase. I have heard him talk in Question Time about other countries that have brought in a GST subsequently increasing their levels by 2 1/2 per cent or 5 per cent, but here we have sales tax collections under the present Government increasing threefold. The reason nobody has protested against that is that this is a hidden tax. Nobody knows about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our system the GST will be brought in at 15 per cent. If any government in the future so much as increases it, or for that matter decreases it, by even one per cent everybody in the country will immediately know about it and the government will be judged at the subsequent election as to whether the reason was a good one or not. Under the present system under this Government, we have had a threefold increase in sales tax collections and hardly anybody knows about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present sales tax system, as embodied in the legislation we are debating tonight, is totally hidden to the average man in the street. In that sense, it is totally dishonest and, as I have highlighted, it is very complicated and, in many cases, costly to collect. By contrast, the GST which we on this side would like to see replace items such as this present legislation is a very simple tax. It is a visible tax, it is an honest tax, and it is fair and equitable. Fifty or 60 countries in the world already have it in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second last country to introduce the GST, New Zealand, next door to us, brought it in four years ago under a Labour government. It had the courage to bring it in. Over there it is working very well, and it is one of the reasons why New Zealand is now going ahead as strongly as it is. We would not be wasting the time of the House debating this legislation tonight if we did not have this complex sales tax legislation in place. For the benefit of the House, I will read a letter I received which highlights this point. It is from the Managing Director of the Mitre 10 store in Dubbo. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your phone call yesterday and also your fax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say that I like the GST Fightback Package, particularly because it educates us to what taxes we are paying and secondly, having seen it work in America and New Zealand, it is easy to follow and it helps get some incentive back into our country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a Retailers point of view, it is a tremendous saving in Wholesale Sales Tax, which is dead money lying on our shelves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would estimate at the moment we have between $120,000-$150,000 in WST. The amount paid out each year would be approximately $350,000. It is a very costly tax the WST, so the GST would free up funds for more development and employment. The GST Fightback Package would be a cash-flow bonanza.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I estimate fuel excise abolition would save our enterprise a minimum of $8000 in the first year. Our freight bill is in excess of $40,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding Mitre 10 Hardware and True Value Hardware (generally our smaller stores) we have 640 in total in Australia as of the 31st March 1992. We have 468 Mitre 10 Stores and 172 True Value Stores. If it is an advantage to have a break down per state, please advise me and I will get it from our National Office in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our turnover is in excess of $1.6 Billion Dollars making us the fourth largest Retailer in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be hard to estimate the WST sitting on shelves of all Mitre 10 and True Value stores in Australia due to the different product mixes in each store. No doubt it would be in excess of $50,000,000 at say 31st March 1992.</PARA>

<PARA>If we could get rid of this legislation totally in this country and bring in a GST, more stores could work on a more equitable basis. There is a store with upwards of $150,000 in sales tax sitting on its shelves which the store has had to lay out and will not get back until the sales are made. During a recession, in many instances hardware taxed at 20 per cent can be sitting on the shelves for two or three years. Under a GST, that would be refunded much more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been members on the Government side of the House who would also have liked to get rid of the type of legislation that we are debating tonight. On 4 June 1985, the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said this on the Willesee program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the broad-based consumption tax is brought in, those increasing numbers of people in the community who buy the use of clever lawyers and accountants have avoided the payment of any tax on their income and also, in the absence of a consumption tax, aren't paying any tax on the spending of that income. They will be caught up there by the twelve and a half per cent consumption tax, they will be paying tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Back in those days he believed that this sort of legislation should be abolished. Back in those days the present Prime Minister was the greatest advocate of a consumption tax of all. He probably believed more passionately than anybody else in Australia that sales tax such as we are debating here now should be abolished and a consumption tax should replace it. When he addressed the National Press Club in June 1985, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main advantages of (consumption) tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful "net dividend" for distribution to the rest of the community . . . For business, this is a simple tax. They will also benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks . . . For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it has come to the crunch, short-term political interests have always come first. But I think it is fair to say that, at least to some extent the community as a whole has been prepared to let its politicians get away with that attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result has been across a whole range of areas, that Australia's economic performance has been below par. The country has not been working to the peak of its achievable capacity because we, as a community, have not been prepared to let it do so. There is no more glaring example of this than our existing tax system. It is decrepit and in a state of virtual decay.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that quote of the Prime Minister highlights the mess we are in with the sales tax Bill before us tonight on recycled paper and the other sales tax Bill on swimming pools. In the same address, the Prime Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our existing system is a dead weight to the economy. The complexity of the system is notorious. The time has come when something must be done. Our existing tax system is unfair. We aim to make it fairer.</PARA>
<PARA>Only two days later in a speech to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> taxation symposium he said, and this is pertinent to the legislation before us tonight:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of us, especially those in positions of influence, have I believe, an important duty to ensure that the debate . . . remains on this higher plane . . . We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this . . . It would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse to the lowest common denominator. The emotive claim of the screaming headline will always be a strong temptation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the question is whether we have, as a nation, the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that, unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the too hard basket for another 20 to 30 years at immense cost to the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .           . . .           . . .           . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present tax system is riddled with ad hoc concessions which destroy investment decisions. Instead of being made on the basis of genuine economic return, investment decisions are often made on the basis of short-run cash flow as determined by the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that has been highlighted here tonight. After hearing Government speakers earlier today slamming the GST for what it does, trying to convey to the Australian people that 15 per cent will be added on to the price of everything, I ask them to turn to those words of the present Prime Minister when he was passionately advocating this tax back in 1985. I believe that the present Prime Minister has not changed his mind. He is still probably the greatest advocate of this tax, but he has had to change his words because of the political debate in this country. We have had the courage to come out and say that we will introduce it. Unfortunately, back in those days when the present Prime Minister was advocating this tax, Bill Kelty knocked it on the head. That was a sad thing for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining to me I wish to say a few words about the swimming pool fiasco and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. Back in 1986 this Government imposed sales tax on in-ground concrete swimming pools, but in doing so it exempted owner-builders from paying this tax. Honourable members can guess what happened. The owner-builder group of swimming pool manufacturers flourished in this country and by 1990 the number of owner-builders of in-ground swimming pools had increased from 10 per cent to 40 per cent. This is the sort of thing that happens when sales tax measures such as this are embodied in the legislation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut a long story short, eventually the High Court ruled on the legislation. The High Court said that it was constitutionally invalid and now the sales tax has to be paid back. However, this has many difficulties because it was very silly legislation in the first place. The legislation that we are debating today does not seem to be much better. For example, only the pool builder can initiate a claim even though the refund in most cases will be returned to the owner. Before the pool builder can initiate the claim, as I understand it from reading the legislation, the pool builder first has to pay back the sales tax to the owner. One can imagine the cost and the hassle of that to the pool builder. Why should the pool builder have to do that? What will happen if the pool builder refuses to do it? What remedy is available to the person who has purchased the pool and paid sales tax on it to get back the money if the pool builder absolutely refuses to do it? Many pool builders are very hard to trace. In recessionary times such as these people have gone out of building in-ground pools to a large extent. Many builders have gone broke and have drifted away to do other things, or they are in the long dole queue which is already a million people long in this country today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be other hassles as well. The 20 per cent sales tax applied only to the concrete pool walls, not to the pumps and accessories. Therefore the refund will probably be equivalent to only 7 per cent of the total cost of the job. Already that has caused a lot of animosity amongst pool owners who think they should be getting more money than they have. It is also causing great anguish amongst pool builders. What proof do the owners have that the sales tax was actually charged in the first place? In many instances it was not charged by people illegally evading the system. I would say that the Bill particularly targets those who were trying to do the right thing. So those people are penalised. The whole legislation is a nonsense. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not planned to take part in the debate tonight even though my name is on the speakers list, but when I heard the drivel coming from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who spoke previously, I felt that I had to say something. I see that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is leaving the chamber to watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. I hope he enjoys tonight's program as much as we enjoyed it last night. It was a fantastic program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few things that the honourable member for Parkes said need to be commented upon. First of all, he railed about the disadvantages of the wholesale sales tax system because some paper products carried the wholesale sales tax and others did not. He saw that as a disadvantage. He thought that they should all carry the wholesale sales tax if we were to have such a regime. I see it more as an advantage in that the wholesale sales tax can actually discriminate between products&mdash;that is, we can choose to put a tax on a product or we can choose to leave it off. For instance, we choose not to tax food and we choose not to tax clothing. But under the goods and services tax, which the honourable member opposite advocated as the replacement for a wholesale sales tax, there are no such advantages because all the goods and services that most people buy and use are subject to a 15 per cent goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also mentioned 59 countries&mdash;or a great number of countries&mdash;that have a wholesale sales tax. That was put up as some reason why this country should have one. Most of those countries have death duties as well. If we extend the argument that we are to do the same in this country as is done in other countries, I wonder whether he is also advocating death duties which exist in those other countries. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. If we are to have the argument that because every other country has a goods and services tax, or a value added tax, this country should have one, let us go the whole hog. Let us not stop there. If we are going to embrace such a tax, let us embrace the death duties that exist in other countries. Of course, there was not a word about that. So the argument falls flat on its face. Why should we worry about having a goods and services tax because a host of other countries have one?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What many people do not realise is that, to be a member of the EEC, a country has to have a goods and services tax. It is not an option. If a country wants to join the EEC, it has one. Many countries have embraced that method of taxation simply to be a member of the EEC. There is nothing rational in it. There are policies in the EEC which we castigate, and rightly so. I refer to policies concerning farm products. The value added tax is, of course, a handy way of raising revenue. The easiest way of raising revenue under a goods and services tax is simply to put it up. If one looks at what other countries have done with a goods and services tax, one starts to get an appreciation of why people in Treasury particularly, or some people in Treasury&mdash;I will not tar the whole lot&mdash;and people who study economics, such as Professor Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, are so attracted to a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason those opposite are attracted to a goods and services tax is that it is easy to raise revenue. If they want more money, they will just put up the tax. In the United Kingdom, the value added tax started at 10 per cent and is currently at 17 1/2 per cent. Austria started its goods and services tax at 8 per cent and now it is 20 per cent. If we want to go further north, in Denmark it started at 10 per cent and now is 22 per cent. When one looks at the deficiencies of $4 billion identified by Treasury and Finance in the Fightback package, the other $2.5 billion identified by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the recurrent and one-off costs, it is quite clear that the goods and services tax will have to rise by 3 per cent initially to cover that shortfall. So it will not be a 15 per cent goods and services tax if the arithmetic is to add up; it will be an 18 per cent goods and services tax from day one. Otherwise, those opposite would have to fudge the figures. If we draw a comparison with what has happened to the goods and services tax in other countries, we know that it will go up. But, if those opposite are to make it add up on day one, it should be 18 per cent, not 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes went on about the Government's having once looked at a goods and services tax. That is right, we did. We went to the Tax Summit in 1985 with option C, amongst other options. But we did not embrace it. Instead, we did a number of other things to broaden the tax base. We brought in the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax, the withholding tax and a number of other measures, which were opposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party both here and in the Senate. What they did was to take an alternative path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members on the other side who speak on this Bill take the sort of approach that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) got upset about today; they go halfway but not the full way. The Government did look at a goods and services tax. But it rejected it, took another path and broadened the tax base. There is no need now for a goods and services tax. In fact, with Australia coming out of recession, why would anyone clobber people with a goods and services tax of 15 per cent, most of it on small businesses&mdash;the very businesses that the Liberal Party and National Party say will lead our economic recovery? Those opposite would clobber them with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the honourable member for Parkes got a letter from Mr Brennan of Mitre 10, which has $1.6 billion worth of sales. Sure, a goods and services tax might advantage Mitre 10. But I can tell honourable members that small family corner stores that compete with Mitre 10 will be disadvantaged because Mitre 10, being a big organisation, pays payroll tax and a number of other taxes which those opposite would eliminate. But, of course, the operator of the little corner hardware store, the one-man show competing with Mitre 10, would be disadvantaged by the Fightback package because he does not currently pay payroll tax. </PARA>

I am answering the points raised by the honourable member for Parkes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see that large retailers in Australia do have the expertise to handle a goods and services tax whereas the operator of the one-man corner hardware store, who has to do all the work himself, who has to compute the tax, do the tax return, express the value that he has added, the profit margin, would be disadvantaged by a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other areas in which a goods and services tax will work against the people of Australia. Two areas have not been mentioned, one of which is second-hand goods. There has been mention of the goods and services tax on cars and the fact that people who buy Ferraris, Jaguars or any of the up-market cars will be fairly well off; those cars will be cheaper. As the Treasurer mentioned some time ago in Parliament, a Ferrari would be $30,000 cheaper whereas a new Falcon would be $1,500 more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people in my electorate do not buy new cars; they buy second-hand cars. For most of the people in my electorate who buy a second-hand car worth about $8,000, that would be their best car; that would be their No.1 car. Most people buy cars worth between $6,000 and $8,000. But, under the regime that those opposite are advocating, people would have to add another $1,200, another 15 per cent, to that cost. That is not all; people who go to the St Vincent de Paul Society to buy second-hand clothes will also have to pay an additional 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that has not been mentioned as much as it should have been is services. Let us remember that we are talking about a goods and services tax. For instance, presently there is no tax on car repairs. When we put our cars in for a lube and oil change, we pay tax only on the oil and the components that go into the service. We do not pay any tax on the labour. But, under the Opposition's regime, everything clocked up to labour would also attract a 15 per cent tax. Men and women would have to pay 15 per cent more for haircuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there is no tax on funerals. But, under the Opposition regime, there will be a 15 per cent goods and services tax when we depart this world. Those opposite will not miss people even when they are on their way out.

I have to tell those opposite that out in the real world they will have to do a bit better than that.

In here they may be able to debate points of economics about the method of collection and the way that one tax might be more fair than another. But out in the real world they really have to make it stick. They really have to come up with arguments that will capture the imaginations of Australian people&mdash;and, for the reasons I have outlined earlier, they have not done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also deals with swimming pools, and we are talking about taxes on swimming pools. All that the original wholesale sales tax was intended to do was to tax the pool liner at the wholesale level; we were not talking about anything else. Let us look at the Opposition's replacement. It is advocating a 15 per cent goods and services tax on the pool, the pool liner, the labour to put it in, all the accessories that go with it, and the running costs into the future. If those opposite want to talk about the difference between the wholesale sales tax on swimming pools that currently exists and that which they propose, they should do their homework and start telling people about the way in which the goods and services tax will impact on swimming pools now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have spoken for long enough to answer some of the misconceptions that have been brought up here tonight when we compare the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax. But I make the point again that, under the wholesale sales tax, at least we can discriminate and pick out those goods which we believe should carry a higher tax burden than others. For instance, I think a Ferrari car should carry a higher tax burden than a Falcon, but under the policy of those opposite all cars will be taxed at the same rate, at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that those opposite have not brought up is services, which will also carry the 15 per cent. Every time somebody adds the value of labour to a product, 15 per cent will go onto it. Those opposite say they will get rid of payroll tax, but what they are actually doing is putting a 15 per cent payroll tax into place&mdash;a 15 per cent payroll tax on all labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I look forward to this debate, but not so much the debate in here because most of those opposite come in with prepared speeches and read them out, unlike me. I came in here to debate the points put forward by the honourable member for Parkes. I have debated his points. I have shot every one of them down. I leave it to other speakers to bring up new areas that we might debate in the future. But the real debate about this wholesale sales tax versus the goods and services tax will be carried out in the streets of Australia. The one thing that we have to remember about the wholesale sales tax is that it is on the wholesale price, not the retail price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's goods and services tax actually builds in the profit margin and taxes that as well, so if anybody, especially in country areas, with a monopoly can increase his or her profit margin because of the lack of competition, those opposite will tax that too. They are going to tax the monopoly powers that exist in some country areas and in some metropolitan areas as well. I look forward to the debate. The Opposition will have to do a lot better out in the streets of Australia than it has done in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, unlike the previous speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), I would like first and foremost to address myself to the legislation at hand, and firstly the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992. It is a pity that the honourable member is not staying in the House to listen to some of the points I will make because he and the Government should hang their heads in shame and apologise for getting it wrong in the first place, for not doing their homework. They were driven by the Richardson effect, a cheap exercise in buying votes for the so-called Green movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This wholesale sales tax on recycled products did just that; it got it wrong. It got it so totally wrong that in my electorate the Government threatened some 70 jobs. The Government was exporting jobs overseas because it did not understand the industry and did not understand what it was doing. Let me explain that point. APM at Maryvale manufactures paper bags, both brown and white. The Government's legislation provided that recycled products be exempt from sales tax. It sounded reasonable and gave one, as a conservationist, a warm, inner glow. But when one analyses the facts, one sees that it just did not work; it distorted the market. The companies that are in the pulp and paper industry are already recycling up to 700 tonnes of paper back into that industry. They had a magnificent record without anything to do with the Green movement because it was good business to do so. They bought in paper and other products and put them into cardboard boxes. It went mainly into that ripple effect inside cardboard boxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Bill came in applying a 20 per cent sales tax to recycled products, all that happened in the brown paper industry was that that paper went out of cardboard boxes and into brown paper bags. But what about white paper bags? There was a market for those but this Government failed to understand the Australian industry. There is no white paper of the long fibre recycled in Australia. Let me explain that point. We have in this country basically two sorts of pulp. There is one that comes from the imported Pinus radiata. It is a long fibre which is good specifically for products such as white paper bags that require a high strength value. But our greatest strength in this country is our eucalyptus forests. The eucalypt has a short fibre which is absolutely brilliant for high quality business paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry was recycling this paper back into business paper, into the notepads that we use in this place. That is where it ought to be. When they tried to buy paper of the long fibre, it just was not available. What happened was that that pulp and those white paper bags came in from overseas. This particular piece of legislation had the net effect of exporting jobs from the country. Not one kilo extra of pulp was recycled, but jobs were. They were taken right out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the most extraordinary situation where the management of APM came to me and said, `We want you to put a 20 per cent sales tax on our recycled brown paper bags to bring them into line with the white paper production line'. The next thing that happened was that the union movement came along and asked me to do the exact same thing because it recognised quite clearly that jobs were at risk&mdash;jobs were being exported overseas. The unions understood quite clearly the effect that recycling was having on their industry. They knew about the white paper which is highly recommended for the recycling of business paper, and they also knew that the long fibred paper was readily available in Europe but was not available here. They started off by saying that the Richardson effect was not well thought out. It was a shabby and shameful attempt to buy votes. When it was passed it gave everybody the warm, inner glow that they were doing the right thing. It was a piece of legislation that was enacted in haste. Quite frankly, the Government got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), the honourable member for Canning, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) on the Labor side have not apologised for getting it wrong. They talked about small corrections. Small corrections are terrific for the 60-odd employees who look like losing their jobs! Some small correction that would have been, with their jobs exported overseas. This is why this Government has got it so terribly wrong in the warm, inner glow of the environment movement versus the hard-headed business of recycling. Yet it probably would claim that it did not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time industry quite clearly told the Government because it came forward and said, `This will be the effect of legislation in this area'. But no, the Government would not listen because it had its own green agenda. Senator Watson accurately predicted in the Senate the outcome of this legislation, but once again the eyes of those opposite were closed. All the Government could see were votes from the green movements, their masters. That part of the environmental lobby dictated the terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to look at the role the Australian Democrats will play in this. Where will they stand?  Will they support this legislation or vote against it and in favour of exporting jobs out of Australia?  I will be very keen to hear whether they really know what they are talking about, or whether they are in favour of a warm inner glow in catering to a few greenies rather than heeding the hard-nosed reality of what this legislation does to Australia and Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this whole environmental debate that has been brought about by this Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, it is interesting to go back and recall what happened at Wesley Vale. During that time the environmental debate came forward, but it was confused by arguments about so many tonnes of so-called effluent going into the ocean. It was said what a disaster that would be for Bass Strait, and what a disaster it would be for Tasmania if a pulp and paper mill were built in Burnie or in Wesley Vale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Government do at that time?  It sent a delegation overseas to have a look at world best practices, so it thought. But the Government got it wrong again. Why should a Government delegation go overseas when the world best practices are right here in Australia, right here in the Latrobe Valley? We meet standards down there which are well above what were proposed for Wesley Vale and well above what were proposed as world best standards. They have already been met, and that has been the case for some 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an automatic monitoring system on APM, a world first, whereby if their effluent does not meet the environmental standards there is an automatic shutdown;  they have to pond it on their own properties until they clean it up. That system is a world first. But this greenie driven government, this shallow government, this shabby government sent people overseas and did not look in its own backyard. Shame on the Government because it did not recognise the excellence of Australian engineers doing it better than anyone else in the world. Not once have I heard any honourable member praise what an extraordinary job is being done by what was then the Latrobe Valley Water and Sewerage Board, and now called Gippsland Waters, in disposing of effluent from a pulp and paper mill and the Latrobe Valley in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, we got to a stage where the Government had this warm inner feeling and sent people overseas to see what was happening there. But overseas they were talking about a totally different resource. They were not talking about eucalypt forests and their problems; they were talking about the long fibred forests. Once again, the basic input to the pulp and paper industry overseas is different from the position in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now to move on slightly to remarks made by the honourable member for Canning. I noticed that during his 20-minute speech he spent less than three minutes talking about the Bill before us and some 17 minutes bucketing the Opposition and the goods and services tax. The honourable member made three points that were totally wrong. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WT4">Mr RIGGALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a totally shameful misrepresentation because it is totally wrong. Why does he not get it right?  The honourable member also said that wholesale sales tax does not impact on small business. I would like to point out one small example from my electorate where we have the great dairy industry that exports some $700m worth of produce for this country every year. We have all seen the milk tankers going up and down the roads. I rang one of the dairy companies and asked, `What is the life expectancy of a set of tyres on a milk tanker?'. I was told it was about six months on a new tyre and about another six months on a retread tyre. I said, `Fair enough'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I rang up the supplier of tyres to the milk company and said, `What is the wholesale sales tax on tyres, both new and second-hand?'. The company came up with two figures which the salesman knew right off the top of his head, and the supplier later gave it to me in writing. The wholesale sales tax on a new tyre for a milk tanker is $80;  the figure as applied to the rubber on a retreaded tyre is $15. So every time one sees a tyre on a truck, there is $95 wholesale sales tax&mdash;hidden tax&mdash;on every tyre on every truck that runs up and down our roads. To make the calculation easy, let us make it $100 and give it a 5 per cent discount. There are 18 tyres on the average milk tanker. It works out at $1,710 sales tax on the tyres alone. It is a hidden tax because nobody knows about it, because it is not up-front. So when a litre of milk gets into the store it has a hidden sales tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then rang around the companies and said, `What payroll tax do you pay?'. The answer came back, `About $2m in payroll tax'. That is profit directly out of the dairy farmers' pockets and money that that district does not see. The payroll tax is taxation that is hidden. It is a shifty tax, it is a disguised tax, and is put up by stealth. It is the same as the wholesale sales tax in that it is put up by stealth. It is not open, it is not up-front, and it is not honest. It is a 1930 model taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then if we have a look at the training guarantee levy, there is another $400,000 in hidden tax. By legislation there is another $400,000 that one has to pay in one way or the other or distort the tax. These are the hidden taxes that will be replaced by GST. In fact, one exercise that was done showed that by the time a kilo of butter reached one's breakfast table, the hidden taxes impacted on that 220 times. It is no wonder this Government likes that tax because it can put it up by stealth. The Government does not have to be open or up-front about it; the Government can put it up by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the wholesale sales tax has gone from $3 billion to $10 billion over the past eight years. There were no big announcements; the tax was just shifted and fiddled around with over time. The wholesale sales tax is not up-front and not honest because people do not know what they are paying. People would be ashamed to know what they are paying. So the honourable member for Canning is wrong when he says there is no tax on food. There is hidden tax on food. It impacts on a kilo of butter 220 times. Anybody who lives in the country knows very well the cost of transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. An awful lot of points have been made, many of them of marginal relevance to the actual content of this legislation. I will sum up with a few very brief comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill, I do not think anyone seriously disputed the policy intent of treating in-ground concrete pools in the same way as above-ground pools for sales tax purposes. Of course, the original 1986 legislation to give effect to that intent was struck down because of a technical deficiency, but I think the policy intent involved in that clearly remains valid. I guess the argument is about how we deal with the situation which has arisen as a consequence of the decision by the High Court of Australia. The argument concerns the appropriate way to go about making refunds of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the contributions have questioned or queried the desirability of an arrangement that requires some sort of action on the part of the pool builder, but I do not think there is any practical alternative to that. The pool purchaser would obviously not be in a position to know the amount of sales tax paid on the pool or the extent to which the sales tax was passed on. The person concerned did not actually pay the tax in the first instance, so it has dubious constitutional validity to talk about refunding the tax directly to the pool owner. For all of those reasons there is really no practical alternative but to involve the pool builder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central intent of the Government is to try to legislate in such a way that refunds paid are passed on to the pool purchaser and to avoid providing a windfall gain to the pool builder. I suppose our basic disagreement with the Opposition is that we think the Opposition's proposals will have the effect of providing a windfall gain to a great many pool builders who would, in practice, have passed on that tax liability to the purchaser. I think that is the central point and I do not intend to take it any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the sales tax legislation, there does not appear to be any significant policy disagreement now between government and Opposition. I understand there was a problem about the question of some sort of transitional compensation for people who were affected by this legislation and who would otherwise have been eligible for an exemption. </PARA>

That legal advice was passed on by the Association to its members, and in accordance with that advice, and not unnaturally, they were advised that there was no need to pay the sales tax any longer. As any responsible corporate body or association of employers would do, the Association signals its intentions to challenge the constitutional validity to the Australian Taxation Office. Never at any stage was there an ambush by the Association and nor, I suspect, would that be claimed by either the Commissioner or the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner's reaction to this advice was to ensure that what he saw as the interests of the revenue were safeguarded. In other words, if the matter were decided by the High Court in favour of the Commissioner, the full amount of tax payable would be paid to the ATO in the normal way. The Association for its part was concerned that, if its members ceased to pay sales tax and if the matter were determined in the Commissioner's favour, some members would be unable to fund the payment because the taxes that had not been paid would have built up over that period. In the event of a decision going against the Association, it would have placed an unnatural burden on members of the Association&mdash;the pool builders. Had the High Court found in favour of the Commissioner, they were also concerned about the matter of penalties, the extent of which is largely at the discretion of the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the brief background of the agreement being negotiated and entered into between SPASA and the ATO. The agreement provided that members would continue to lodge sales tax returns and pay amounts as and for sales tax. That seemed an eminently sensible arrangement to overcome the possible default that, as I mentioned, the Commissioner was concerned about and to meet the concerns of the pool builders. It was agreed in these discussions that, if the constitutional challenge being mounted by the Association and its members was successful, the amounts paid under the agreement were to be refunded to SPASA members unconditionally together with interest. Copies of letters constituting that agreement are available, and I am sure they have been seen by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and people on this side of the chamber. That was a contract freely entered into. There was no duress on either party, as far as I can tell, and there was certainly none on the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the High Court of Australia eventually, in what is now known as the Mutual Pools case, held that legislation purporting to impose sales tax on in-ground concrete swimming pools was constitutionally invalid. One would have thought in these circumstances that the agreement would have applied and that the amounts payable under the agreement would be refunded unconditionally to SPASA members together with interest. That is a perfectly reasonable expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It transpires, though, that the ATO has not honoured its agreement with SPASA to refund the amounts paid under the terms of the agreement. Quite simply, as I said earlier this evening, the ATO ratted on the agreement. This happened despite the ATO having taken legal advice in relation to the agreement and having written to SPASA indicating that it could act upon the principles of the agreement. One would have thought that everything was covered and that the reasonable expectations of the pool builders would be met in those circumstances. As I have already indicated, they were not. It is for that reason that we propose to insert proposed new clause 3A. That is the state of play at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first objective to be met by the Association in entering into an agreement with the ATO is not covered in the wording of the Act. As it transpires, clause 3 and clause 4, subclause (1), do not reflect the stated intention of the Government. In fact, the Bill as proposed clearly leaves SPASA subject to the other provisions of the Bills which are not in accordance with the agreement about which I just spoke. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to unduly delay the House at this late hour, but it is important that we recognise that there are two very distinct issues involved here. On the one hand, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill attempts to negate an agreement, as described by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), made by the Australian Taxation Office and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association. On the other hand, it tries to recompense pool owners for a tax which has been unlawfully levied from 1986. Let me separate those two issues so that we understand them. From 1986 until mid-1990, pool builders largely collected the tax from their clients in some manner or other, difficult as it was, and passed that tax on to the Australian Taxation Office. Many of those pool builders no longer exist in law because of this recession. As a result of that and, recognising the wording of the Bill, it will be impossible for any pool owner to obtain a refund under the provisions of this legislation without having a pool builder refund the owner his or her tax money and then claim on the Government. This is all within the time span of 1986 through to mid-1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, with royal assent to this Bill&mdash;if the House passes this Bill and the Senate concurs&mdash;we will in fact have a situation where natural justice will be denied to thousands of purchasers of swimming pools across Australia who paid an illegal, unconstitutional tax. That is clearly not fair to those thousands of families and individuals around Australia who are due a refund of the tax that they paid to their pool builder, which was then forwarded to the Taxation Office under regulations then in force, now found not to have been constitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue is the time span between 1986 and mid-1990, where we have problems in trying to get the refunds back to the pool owners. This Bill does not address them, and it is our recommendation as part of this amendment to the Bill that those matters be considered in committee, that they be considered in a detailed manner and that submissions be taken from the public and from the pool builders so that we get it right and do the right thing by those pool owners and the pool companies who paid their tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue occurred after mid-1990, when some pool builders continued to remit tax to the Taxation Office under an agreement with the Tax Office that, if their challenge in the High Court was upheld, they would be refunded their money and would then not charge their clients tax. They are due refunds now, and in fact were due refunds in February of this year when the High Court found in favour of the pool companies. In essence, this Bill attempts to remove the obligation on the Government and the Australian Taxation Office to refund immediately, together with interest, all moneys held by it on behalf of pool companies from mid-1990 until February 1992. This amendment attempts to resolve that issue so that we remove from the legislation those clauses and those references in other clauses requiring pool companies to submit invoices to the ATO and somehow have them certify that they are due the refunds in some manner or other which is not made clear in the legislation. So there are two issues across two time spans which we attempt to deal with in this amendment. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member&mdash;to hear me speak on the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill. I strongly support the amendment moved by the Opposition. Frankly, I was absolutely astounded, after what we have heard in this debate, to hear the remarks of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), which were perfunctory and dismissive, when we have clearly illustrated that this legislation is totally flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has received a letter from one of my constituents. I will read his reply with interest. My constituent points out that the Treasurer said in the Budget Papers that my constituent would be entitled to a refund of the sales tax. He points out to the Treasurer that the builder who built his pool has since gone into liquidation. He asks the Treasurer how he is going to get a refund. I take it from the legislation that the Government's answer is, `Too bad; there is no mechanism'. In other words, what is said in the Budget Papers is clearly misleading; it is wrong. The Government has no answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have said that we recognise the difficulties, but we have suggested that there are other ways of achieving the objective. We have agreed that the objective is right. Clearly, the Government has a responsibility, in view of the High Court decision, to refund the money. However, it is evading that responsibility. I suspect that it is doing it to some extent intentionally. There may be $50m involved here. From my reading of this legislation, I take it that the Government's intention is to make it as difficult as possible&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or impossible for people to get their hands on that money. I am disappointed that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer either does not understand or does not appreciate what the Opposition has said about this. What is the answer to that question? I have thousands of pool owners in my electorate affected by this legislation. A significant number of pool builders have gone out of business since 1986. On my estimate, that simply means that perhaps half of those, who have paid sales tax on their concrete pools when they ought not to have paid it, will not be able to get their money back. We do not have a satisfactory answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question which the Minister Assisting the Treasurer failed to answer adequately relates to the mechanics of this legislation. Pool builders, who are small businessmen, tell me that they are apparently expected to go out and borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars, at high interest rates, to fund the refunds to their customers and then apply to the Tax Office to get the money back, which could take months and months. That is a totally unreasonable expectation of a small businessman. </PARA>

That agreement was entered into by both parties in good faith&mdash;that they would accept the decision of the High Court and that, if the Tax Office lost the action, the money that had been collected in the period in question would be refunded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This is a highly subjective question which cannot be satisfactorily answered by a simple yes or no. Concentration of media ownership in Australia is a matter that the Government has taken a close interest in and on a number of occasions we have acted to strengthen the rules in relation to the electronic media. In relation to concentration of ownership of the print media, which can only be incidentally affected by Commonwealth powers, the honourable member will be aware that a committee of this House has now reported on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I understand Mr Murdoch has controlling interests in 61.7% of daily metropolitan newspapers. I do not have access to the sort of confidential information necessary to answer the honourable member in relation to newspapers financed by Mr Murdoch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I understand that Mr Packer has controlling interests in 51.4% of the 30 highest circulation magazines published in Australia and that Mr Murdoch controls another 37.2%. That means the two gentlemen hold controlling interests in 88.6% of those magazines. However, I must remind the honourable member that the Broadcasting Act does not apply to magazines, and neither does any other piece of Commonwealth legislation with the exception of the incidental effects of Acts such as the Trade Practices Act. I suggest that, if he is concerned about  concentration of ownership of magazines, he address his questions to the various State and Territory governments which have responsibilities for that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I do not have figures for newspaper closures since 1983. I remind the honourable member that the print media falls into the prime responsibility of the States and Territories under the Constitution. However, I understand that eight daily and four Sunday newspapers have ceased publication since 1987. This includes papers merged with other papers. Two national papers, including one which was published for about six weeks, also closed during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The government will do all that it can, within the limits of Commonwealth Constitutional power, to protect the public interest in this matter. However, no sweeping undertakings can be given. We cannot, for example, prevent insolvent firms going out of business, even if that would create greater concentration of media ownership. Nor can we undertake to prevent further concentration regardless of the other consequences. The public interest has to be assessed in light of all relevant circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. The aim of the cross media rules was to break the overwhelming control of the electronic media by print media interests and to prevent future domination by one person of the sources of public information in a given area. The rules succeeded in that aim, but they are only one aspect of the measures to limit concentration of media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal held an inquiry into the proposed sale of the Fairfax Group, but that should not be taken as an assumption that the cross-media rules would have been breached by any of the bids in that case. That was a matter to be proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Amendments to the Broadcasting Act in 1991 greatly expanded the role and powers of the Tribunal before a transaction. These are commented on in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's Tourang report (IO 91/78) at paragraphs 2.2, 2.3, 3.1 and 3.10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) I do not believe the honourable member's words directly quote the former Minister, but they reflect the spirit of his speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is an independent statutory body. I have extremely limited powers to direct it in the exercise of its powers and my powers do not extend to directing the Tribunal to act in particular cases. However, the Tribunal did act on the Fairfax matter, and has acted effectively, thanks, in part, to the recent amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The Tribunal has kept the situation with the Fairfax Group under constant review. Formal investigation commenced with a meeting between the Tribunal and Mr Peter Barron of Consolidated Press Holdings Limited on 12 September 1991, and a formal inquiry into the bids for the Fairfax Group was announced by the Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr Peter Westerway, on 26 November 1991. On 13 December 1991 the Tribunal announced the closure of the Fairfax inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The Tribunal has sought and obtained a considerable body of information about the Fairfax bids. In accordance with the statutory obligations of the Tribunal, imposed to ensure the co-operation of parties, that information was treated as commercial in confidence, subject to proceeding to a full public inquiry. The Broadcasting Act requires the Tribunal not to release information lodged with it (other than information relevant to an inquiry) if it would prejudice the interests of any person. When the decision to hold an inquiry was made, the parties were notified of the Tribunal's intention to place all relevant material on the inquiry file and were given the opportunity to apply for restricted access directions under section 19 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The Tribunal did conduct an inquiry into the Fairfax bids. Its powers and role, however, are limited to considering situations which may contravene the Broadcasting Act. As a result of changes in the Tourang consortium, the Tribunal felt it no longer had a role in investigating the bids, so the inquiry was closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) I have some powers to direct the Tribunal to hold inquiries, but I have no power to direct it to exercise its substantive powers and certainly no power to direct it to hold public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) I am unable to speak for my colleagues, particularly in answer to so sweeping a question. All I can say is that I have no power to prevent the Tribunal from performing its functions in the manner it considers appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) No. The honourable member will be aware, however, that the Parliamentary Inquiry into the print media has now reported, and that report covers the issues implicit in these questions. The Government will consider the report's recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. I received the report of the Commonwealth-State Citrus Advisory Group in October 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised, however, that the South Australian branch of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), has recently made a ruling which retains the eligibility of peel juice (usually referred to as diffusion extracted juice or DEJ) for the calculation of local content for the sales tax concession on fruit juice. My Department will have further discussions with the ATO on whether it would  be necessary to take further action, such as a change in law, to remove any possible doubt about the eligibility of peel juice for the local content sales tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the inclusion of peel juice in food regulations, I am aware that the National Food Standards Council, membership of which comprises Commonwealth and  State Health Ministers, supported a recommendation of the previous National Health and Medical Research Council that peel juice be recognised as an ingredient of fruit drinks but not as part of the fruit juice component of these drinks. I understand that this decision was given effect in Amendment 12 to the Food Standards Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. I am advised that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Peter Staples, MP, who is the Commonwealth Minister on the National Food Standards Council, made his final decision on 28 October 1991 from a submission prepared by the National Food Authority on 30 September 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason Mr Staples did not have the Commonwealth-State Citrus Advisory Group's recommendations before him was that the report was not available for release until after he had made his decision. The Advisory Group reported to me and State Ministers for Agriculture in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. By 28 October I had not received acknowledgments of receipt from all Ministers. I was therefore not in a position to release the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes. I am advised that Mr Staples supported Amendment No. 12 when the National Food Standards Council considered the matter. However, this should not be construed as a rejection by the Government of the Advisory Group's recommendations because the Government has yet to make its decision on these recommendations, as previously stated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year I met with Mr Staples and raised industry concerns about the National Food Standards Council's decision to support Amendment 12. As a result of this meeting, I am advised that industry has held discussions with the National Food Authority on alternative options for treatment of peel juice in fruit drink.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arrears on the grain facility now amount to $A 50 million while $A 276 million is overdue on the rollover credit line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is, of course, concerned about non payments against these credits which were requested by the Government of the former Soviet Union and entered into in good faith by Australia. Every opportunity has been taken to seek repayment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, wrote to Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar on 26 March 1992 on the matter. Since then the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Mr Clinton Condon, and the Managing Director of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Mr Graeme Lawless, have visited Moscow to discuss the debt issue with senior Russian Government and Vneshekonombank officials. In its response, the Russian Government has given its assurances that it will do everything possible to ensure that it fulfils its international obligations on foreign debt as soon as possible. However, current economic difficulties, including a chronic shortage of hard currency, have severely limited Russia's ability to meet these obligations in the short term. The Russian Government has indicated that arrears on import payments of the former Soviet Union now amount to US$ 4.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see no purpose being served in my visiting Russia at this time as Australia's concerns have been fully registered at high levels in the Russian Government. In addition, Australia is an active participant in the ongoing negotiations involving the IMF and the Paris Club group of creditor countries to formulate a strategy to address Russia's foreign debt problems. However, the fact that the Russian Government has yet to clear outstanding debts and Australian Government guaranteed credits are no longer available should not be seen as a barrier to the search for trade opportunities between Australia and Russia which the Australian Government is still keen to encourage. For that reason, I will be visiting the Russian Far East later in the year, accompanied by a business delegation, to explore new opportunities for trade.</PARA>
