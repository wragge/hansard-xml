<PARA IN-LINE="1">Yesterday at the Press Club we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) give one of the most extraordinary addresses ever heard at that institution by a Prime Minister totally bereft of policy guidelines to solve the problems facing the Australian people. The legislation before us today, in many respects, is merely a continuum of that attitude. It is worth quoting from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A National Employment and Training Plan For YOUNG AUSTRALIANS</EMPHASIS> which resulted from the national meeting on 22 July of this year when the Government endeavoured to do something to help young people, in particular young people who are unemployed. On page 3 of that document, the opening paragraph reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegates at the National Meeting on 22 July argued strongly that assistance was needed immediately for the young unemployed people who are facing hardship, low self-esteem and a feeling that they have been let down by the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, those words have been echoed across the length and breadth of this continent for many months now and relatively little has taken place to demonstrate the Government's direction or sense of purpose to solve these fundamental problems which have been caused absolutely by the failure of its own economic and social policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the legislation before us today is the result of the Government trying to ease access to welfare payments to the people, to the young people in particular, most hard hit by this self-made recession. This legislation is directed at families and at youth. Sadly, it simply adds up to the reality that the Government is once again fiddling around the edges of the problem instead of addressing the causes. At the eleventh hour it is endeavouring to do something to ease, to some small degree, the pain, but it fails utterly to examine why we are where we are and what are the best solutions to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this is the fundamental difference between the approach taken by the Opposition, by the coalition, and the approach taken by this Government. The family allowance lump sum payment represents a consideration of considerable social value to most Australian families. There are now 1.25 million Australians dependent on unemployment payments. This includes over 800,000 claimants and their 245,000 spouses and 330,000 children. More than 41 per cent of these have been relying on unemployment benefits now for well over 12 months. Overall, more than 680,000 children are living in a family where neither parent has employment. Not only was this an increase of 63,000 since early 1992 but, as is pointed out in the Catholic Bishops <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Wealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS> statement to be released today, it means that every day another 500 children under the age of 14 are being added to this horrendous total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General economic statistics show that the total stock of national savings was reduced last year as reserves were run down. Consequently, our demand on overseas borrowing rose inexorably. Households have responded to falling incomes by saving less to maintain their consumption levels. As also pointed out by the bishops, the pattern of wealth distribution in Australia is one of growing inequality. Moreover, inequality of income has also increased considerably over the past 10 years. Those with middle incomes have suffered a significant drop in the proportion of the national income reaching them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, Australia's middle income earners have been the vast majority and the ones who, to a large degree, have carried the brunt of the massive retrenchments we have seen take place in recent months. In the year to March, 180,000 jobs disappeared from Australia's private sector&mdash;a contraction of 4.2 per cent in the private sector work force alone. Employment in the private sector has fallen to 4.1 million people, a decrease of about 450,000 jobs since private sector employment peaked in late 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAS statistics also tell a very sad story. The number of families receiving FAS increased by more than 24 per cent in 1991-92. In June 1992 there were 241,000 families receiving FAS, for some 565,000 Australian children&mdash;an absolute record. The number of families in crisis demonstrates another set of sad statistics. Welfare agencies like the Salvation Army are experiencing an unprecedented demand for their services. They state, `Families in crisis are seeking assistance at a rate exceeding the capacity and ability of these agencies to respond. Many Australians who in the past have been able to support their family by holding down stable jobs are no longer able to do so and consequently families on low incomes are struggling to make ends meet'. I quote once again from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS>. This is what the bishops said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The type of poverty this enquiry has concentrated on is that in which people lack material goods, employment and career prospects, so that they suffer real disadvantage in relation to other members of the community. When, for these reasons, groups or individuals cannot participate fully and freely in the life and decision making of the community, they can be said to be suffering from relative if not absolute poverty. When, for the same reasons, their situation is one of real destitution and apparent hopelessness, they can be regarded as being in a state of absolute poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>According to ACOSS:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gap is widening between those who are secure with a roof over their heads and those who are left out of society and are at the margins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, all of the major welfare organisations providing aid had had a doubling in the amount of people seeking help since the onset of this recession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The numbers seeking temporary shelter have also doubled as a large proportion of those seeking help have never had to do so before.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's solution to date has been limited to these two pathetic pieces of legislation. Its solution is to give families bonus payments out of the blue and to allow them to access some of their family allowance in one lump sum&mdash;in other words, the point I made earlier&mdash;desperately, to try to treat the effects of the problem but not its causes. Family allowances were intended as a supplement to wages policy because wages do not of themselves take account of family responsibilities. It was a coalition government which first introduced the concept of the family allowance. It is a concept which we have continued to support, on both sides of the House, over those years. Consequently, we certainly support this legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that the allowance was not intended as a series of lump sum payments. We supported a Bill a few months ago, passed through this Parliament in May, which enabled the family allowance payments to be paid on alternate weeks to payments of pensions or benefits. The Government claimed at that time, and we supported that claim, that this would ensure that poorer families with children would have access to four cash payments during each month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal provides a better cash flow and assists people who may have some difficulty in budgeting for household expenditure over a two-week period. Consequently, while we acknowledge that many families especially on welfare often face one-off debts, for example health costs or preparing children for school and so forth, nevertheless we caution the Government that any further extension of this tendency which appeared a few months ago, when the Government gave people accessing the family allowance a one-off payment&mdash;perhaps in the belief that it could bribe people by giving them a continuum of one-off payments&mdash;would result in a cutting away at the very basis of the family allowance concept as it currently works. It is meant to be a supplement to wage; it is not meant to be a series of one-off payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are not opposing these amendments, and while we accept that there are certain circumstances, especially at times like this, when low income families in particular may face points of crisis and would like access to a lump sum&mdash;in this case quite a small one; it is only for six months at the single rate&mdash;nevertheless we would not want this to be merely the thin edge of the wedge of a general weakening of the system, as has occurred in New Zealand over recent years where the family allowance was offered for a whole host of reasons other than the purpose for which it was created. I understand that the New Zealand Government has now had to wind back that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Opposition is concerned, the best form of welfare by any stretch of the imagination is the capacity to offer people a job, precisely to overcome the problems noted in the Government's own paper: the perception of young people who are facing hardship. They have the difficulty of low self-esteem and they have a feeling that they have been let down by the community. We can give people supplementary support till the cows come home; the fundamental fact is that young people, in fact all people within the work force age, want to feel that their lives have some meaning, that as individuals they have some capacity to control events in their own lives. They know too well that the only effective way that can be done is to have employment and, through employment, be able to achieve that self-esteem which so many thousands of young Australians have been totally devoid of and lacking because of government policy in recent months. That is why we will be introducing measures to help business get back onto its feet, with the fundamental objective of creating more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Fightback plan will be to cut taxes, improve education, restart business and therefore to create more secure jobs, both for parents and for their children. We believe that the family must be the central building block of our society. That is why we propose doubling the family allowance for families earning under $30,000 per year; for those earning between $30,00 and $40,000, family allowances will increase by 50 per cent; while families earning more than $40,000 will receive a 6 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the waiting periods for access to JSA and for education leavers, which is part of the amendments before the House today. Approximately 30,000 youth under the age of 18 are on Job Search allowance. In August of this year youth unemployment&mdash;those unemployed between the ages of 15 and 19&mdash;was a horrendous 34 per cent, an absolute record since statistics have been kept in this country. That represents over three times the general level of unemployment. The sad fact is that 49,700 of last year's school leavers did not get into universities in Australia this year because there were not sufficient places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment as a proportion of youth population is still less than it was in the early 1980s. While this reflects a smaller youth labour force due to the desirable increase in youth participation in full time education, it clearly signifies a significant amount of hidden unemployment. Many young people are enrolling in school or staying in school due to the lack of available work. In the last two years the Government has made a virtue of the fact that it has increased substantially the school retention rates. Nobody disputes that. I accept the need for children to be well educated. That is a fundamental objective of the policy of the Liberal and National parties, but having kept children at school for an additional two or three years, the inevitable fact still remains that when they finally complete their secondary education, for far too many of them, some 30 per cent, there is nowhere to go. That is a reflection of the total failure of this Government's education, employment and economic policies over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key characteristic of the youth labour market is the collapse of full time job opportunities. This has threatened the opportunities for young Australians to gain skills and experience. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald's</EMPHASIS> Peter Hartcher noted recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental problem confronting Australia is that it cannot grow its economy fast enough to make serious inroads into its unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Government know, as we know, that there has to be an absolute minimum of 3 per cent economic growth a year just to create enough jobs for the natural population growth and for the school leavers. The estimates contained in this year's Budget are exactly that: they are directed at 3 per cent and they anticipate a growth of 800,000 jobs over the next four years. Sadly, that is not enough to take up the slack of the million people who are currently out of the work force, of at least an additional half a million people who have simply dropped out of the system but who otherwise would be available for work, and it significantly does not take account of the fact that an additional 140,000 to 160,000 people are coming onto the labour market each year, the majority of whom are young Australians who ask nothing more of this nation than that they should have the opportunity to make a contribution to its growth, to its success and to its standing in the world, as did their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition are saying time and time again that the saddest thing before this nation is that we are passing on to our children a lower standard of living than that which was inherited by us or by our parents. That is the most diabolical demonstration of the failure of this Government over the last 10 years. The Prime Minister can stand here as he does on occasions and tell us that job participation over the last 10 years has increased. And well it might have, considering that the population over that period has grown by a couple of million people. The sad fact is that in terms of economic growth, which is the engine which drives the economy&mdash;there is no other form of growth except economic growth which creates jobs for the Australian people&mdash;the Government's solution is found to be absolutely wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record high unemployment, the highest level at any time since the Great Depression, has been caused by Labor's engineered recession. It is also due to wages costs and inappropriate wage relativities. The Government and the ACTU continue to deny the relevance of wage costs and those rigidities in creating the current crisis, a crisis which, above all, has kept out of the labour market thousands upon thousands of school leavers and is driving out of the labour market thousands upon thousands of middle-aged Australians aged 45 and above. They are the people who are demonstrating the period of longest unemployment and they are the people which government policy continues to ignore. Sadly, therefore, the Government continues not to address the wages issue in planning an overall solution to these problems. For that reason the Government's Youth Forum, which is the basis for some of this legislation, was virtually useless. It talked about increasing training positions, increasing subsidised jobs and funding for environmental programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposal was earlier access to unemployment benefits, and that is contained in one of the Bills we are debating today. But ultimately these are nothing more than quick fix measures. They do nothing to change the fundamental structural causes of our current massive unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now examine the solutions put forward by the coalition. As I said earlier, we are not opposing this legislation because, in some of these amendments in particular, the Government is following in our direction. For example, the proposal that the conditions relating to the education leavers deferment period be relaxed by part time work is consistent with our policies of encouraging part time work while on Job Search allowance. I would hope to see the Government extend this approach to middle aged unemployed people as well, because that is not the case now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was covered in detail in our own employment statement released some two months ago, where we relaxed a number of the criteria covering access to benefits specifically to identify the fact that we are no longer in the relatively luxurious position of saying that the world consists of two classes: those who are unemployed on benefits and those in full time employment. We are now going through a period of Australia's economic cycle, which could go on indefinitely, when a significant proportion of the population will have access at best to part time or temporary work. That is the work which we now have to identify and relate to the mix of our welfare programs. Regrettably, the Government has not yet taken that on board adequately. However, we have urged the Government to take up longer term structural changes to Australia's attitudes to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will end the discrimination against young people in the labour market by establishing a minimum youth training wage of $3 an hour for 15- to 17-year-olds and $3.50 for 18- to 20-year-olds. We expect that in our first two years of office we should be able to create at least 100,000 jobs with wages at that youth training wage level. We will also supplement this training wage by issuing training vouchers and guaranteeing that no young person will be worse off than if he or she had stayed on Job Search allowance. These proposals will create real jobs and give employers an opportunity to give young school leavers that first job opportunity which is so critical to getting one's feet on the ladder of economic self-sufficiency. They will also reduce the need of young people to have faster access to Job Search allowance, which the Social Security Amendment Bill is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are a result of the Government trying to ease access to welfare payments to people most hard hit by the recession: families and youth. But again, as I said, the Government is essentially only fiddling around the edges instead of addressing the real cause of the problem. There are nearly 1.25 million Australians dependent on unemployment benefits, and that represents 800,000 claimants, their 240,000 spouses and 330,000 children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package we put to the Australian people in July this year was the most comprehensive addressing of these issues that any Opposition has presented in Australia's recent history. This is because the magnitude of Australia's unemployment problem is of such fundamental concern to all of us. I often wonder how members on the Government side, who claim to be representing a Party that looks after the interests of the working people of Australia, are able to look at themselves in the mirror of life and look at their own constituents and honestly say that in the last 10 years they have governed this country in the interests of those people. Quite clearly, the evidence is there for all to see. It has been the failure of this Government over that period that has led to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare Australia with the rest of the world, in particular with the OECD, we see that the sad fact is that in 1970 we had an unemployment rate equal to half the OECD average and that today it is one of the highest in the OECD. We know there has been a collapse in full time employment, affecting males more than females, and since July 1990 the number of part time jobs for full time work has been much greater than in previous recessions. This is not surprising given that the recession is the worst, as I said, for 60 years and that on-costs, which have a fundamental effect on whether one employs that extra marginal unit of labour, have continued to increase in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, in that context, youth unemployment reached a record of 35.8 per cent in June 1992. As I said earlier, it is three times the unemployment rate for those aged 20 and over. Sadly, there is further hidden youth unemployment with many young people who would prefer to work being forced to stay at school or in training institutions. Around 300,000 Australians have been unemployed for over a year, and half of this number are over 35 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992, the 797,000 people receiving unemployment benefits had about 546,000 dependants, including 327,500 relying on unemployment benefits. It has approximately doubled over the past two years to 1.3 million people or 7 per cent of the total Australian population. We know what the causes of the unemployment crisis are: Labor's engineered recession, wage costs and inappropriate wage relativities. They are the two fundamental problems and they are the two issues on which this Government, linked as it is with the ACTU and the trade union movement, demonstrates yet again the tendency of the last 10 years to work on the basic principle of big government, big business and big unions. But between those three legs of its fundamental support base lies the vast majority of the Australian people. Of that vast majority now the Government has at least 1 1/2 million people who are not in the labour market but wish to be there. They wonder what the future is going to hold for their children if current policies continue. It is perfectly clear that it cannot be a successful future unless there is a fundamental change in the direction of this nation&mdash;a change which this Government has demonstrated more than clearly its inability and its unwillingness to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there are now 167,000 young Australians aged between 15 and 20 receiving the Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance. We believe that it is necessary to provide appropriate welfare and support arrangements to ensure that those on youth training wages and the Austrain program which we will initiate in government are not disadvantaged in terms of their transition from the social welfare system. For those living at home, the minimum youth training wage would pay significantly more than the current Job Search allowance. For those under 18, the $114 minimum wage rate is approximately 78 per cent higher and, for those under 20, 69 per cent higher, than the JSA rate, providing a real incentive to get off unemployment benefits and into a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those members of the Government who spent so much time back in July talking about sweat wages and forcing people into jobs of this nature, it is amusing that when, within weeks of our announcement, the Prime Minister finally came out with his package. The actual bottom line difference between our youth training wage and the Government's package was 77c a week. After all that noise, all that performance, all that effort to frighten everybody, and all that determination to demonstrate how the Opposition was made up of ogres who had no objective in mind other than to destroy the future of the youth of Australia, the best the Government could come up with was a differential of 77c. The difference between the Government's figure and ours is this: we have said quite clearly that this is a minimum training wage, with emphasis on the word minimum. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of fundamental importance because it is the mixture of on the job training supplemented by academic or technical training which will determine, in time, the overall success of our young Australians in being able to compete, not just in the Australian labour market but also in the international labour market. The point which the Opposition continues to emphasise in this House and elsewhere is that Australia must be able to compete with the rest of the world. We must be in a position where world best practice is applied in Australia, whether it be in training programs, education programs or the way in which we work and, above all, in the levels of productivity which must be obtained from that level of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the directions in which we want to take Australia. They are different from those of this Government.

This is the document which will lead Australia forward at a time when the best the Government can do is carp about the policies of an Opposition when, as the Prime Minister demonstrated yesterday, it has nothing to offer in its stead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing delineates us quite so clearly from the Opposition as the matter that is the subject of the Social Security Amendment Bill. We are indeed poles apart. This amendment to the Social Security Act is typical of this Government and its ability to respond to people. This amendment is known within Caucus as the Crawford amendment. It should really be known as the Forrester amendment, after a person on my staff, Colleen Forrester. How did this come about? Quite simply, in April this year with the one-off family allowance payment to many families, for the first time many people said that they found themselves in a position to be able to spend a deal of money on winter clothes, school books or other larger items which they had been unable to purchase previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, for the benefit of members of the Opposition who seem to deride this as welfare, that we in fact see family payments as a right. Australian families are entitled to payments from Australian taxpayers and the community because we believe they are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal&mdash;the idea of flexibility and the option of being able to pay family allowance in a block or simply fortnightly&mdash;was then taken to the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is currently at the table. His ability and compassion were demonstrated in that he was able to respond to the demands of people at large. That is why we have before us today a Social Security Amendment Bill which enables families to make a choice about the way in which they will receive that family payment advance. That is how this proposal came about. It shows the Government's ability to respond to people's demands and to do so with speed and flexibility. We are very definitely about the intervention of government. We are about ensuring that people's needs and entitlements are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Opposition members cannot make a speech in this House without, yet again, decrying the fact that young people are staying on at school. What a wicked, wicked thing it is that the poor should want to stay on in years 11 and 12 when previously this was only the prerogative of the rich! Somehow it was all right if one was tory and one's parents had money. Then one could stay on in years 11 and 12. That is a choice those people have made routinely. But because people who are not rich want to make that choice, those opposite think that it is wrong and bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the bottom line in all of this. As I remind honourable members in this House constantly, adults in Queensland over 42 years of age have not even had a high school education because they went to year 8 and did the Scholarship exam, which was later abolished. Honourable members should look at the facts and figures and ask themselves why we have middle aged men in Queensland with so little formal education who are now finding themselves in the unemployment queues because they do not have the skills to meet the needs of the twenty-first century in Australia. It is because formal schooling for very many people in that 40 to 50 age range finished at years 5, 6 and 7 when they went out into these dead end jobs which are espoused by the shadow spokesperson for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House we know about dead end jobs and standards of living. It makes me somewhat bemused when I hear Opposition members talking about standards of living. We know what it is like to live in a community which has no Medicare; when having sick children and no money means that one has to depend on the next door neighbour or watch one's children become terribly ill and hope that somehow they will get better because one does not have a car, telephone or cash to go to the doctor. Do not tell me that that is fantasy land, because we on this side of the House know and understand that that was what life was like for many people in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, we had another taste of it with the introduction of the Medicare co-payment, which I took a very prominent role in getting rid of earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know and understand what it is like for people who have no access to the kinds of provisions and lifestyle which many in this House&mdash;and certainly those honourable members in the Opposition&mdash;take for granted: the telephone, the car, the ready access to computers, and the ready access to all manner of powerful people. We know and understand on this side of the House what our job is here: it is to represent people who, through no fault of their own, do not have access to such things. It is our job to ensure that they have that access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not talk about the fact that standards of living have not risen, that the poor now have access to Medicare, that the poor now stay on at school in years 11 and 12, or&mdash;what is even worse&mdash;that they go to universities.

I will give honourable members a few facts about the participation rate in other countries. In this country, our participation rate is somewhere around 64 to 65 per cent. In the USA, it is 54 to 55 per cent and in Europe it is in the high forties. That is the difference. In Australia, irrespective of gender or age, people expect and have demanded the right to work. It is indeed their right. </PARA>

In a whole range of places, participation and the right to work are not acknowledged; nor are people paid unemployment benefits. European participation, at somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent less than in the work force in Australia, creates a different kind of unemployment situation. One can also perhaps espouse the American situation.

The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) told us that the Opposition would cut family allowance payments.

They do not reflect ideology, rampant and rabid, with the zealotry that has been displayed by those opposite. The way in which we operate and what we as a government believe is at the core of these amendments. When we hear people talking about our young unemployed, we too acknowledge that unemployed youth are in need of particular and special services.

Young people whose mothers happen to be sole parents will have no income whatsoever because these children will be over 12. A whole range of people will be affected.

A lot of that damage will continue to exist for years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) says in his second reading speech on Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) that this new lump sum family payment `will assist in family budgeting'. Despite what the honourable member for Forde says about the payment, it will not do that at all. That is drawing an extremely long bow. Regular monthly instalments, for which most families would probably opt anyway, given the option, already do that quite adequately. To be technical about it, in many respects that regular payment assists family budgeting more than dipping in for a one-off payment that is brought forward would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After reading this legislation and listening to what the Minister had to say in his second reading speech, I asked myself: `What is the real reason behind this illusory generosity which ends up costing the Government about $1m per annum?'. We get a clue for the real motivation for this legislation in the Minister's speech when he talks about `the outstanding success of the family allowance bonus paid earlier this year'. That was the sudden one-off payment that went out to people who were entitled to it across Australia and that cost the Government $300m in one go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister:  what criteria does he use to measure success if he says that payment was successful?  It did not, for example, win the Wills by-election with which it was timed to coincide. In fact, in that respect it was notoriously unsuccessful. The $300m one-off payment, which was quite clearly a bribe preceding the Wills by-election, did not work. </PARA>

It did not take too long for people to realise that this little one-off payment may have been the Government's motivation to people to go out and spend it.

The Minister says in his speech that this legislation aims to help families. One outstanding legacy of the Whitlam Government is the Family Law Act which has led to a huge escalation in divorces since 1975. I blame the Labor Party for that. I am pleased that at the moment the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act is looking into the matter. I believe it will ultimately lead to some very good recommendations. The fault that has flown from that legislation is a legacy of the Whitlam Labor Government. As I have said, we have experienced considerable family breakdown as a direct result of that. The cost of divorce is estimated to be around $2 billion per year. Family law counselling is directed at conciliation and divorce, not reconciliation of marriage.

If the Government wants to take on a debate on a substantive issue, let me put it in these terms: why does the Labor Party continue to fund abortions through Medicare? That is a tough one. Government members will have the opportunity to debate that matter in this place when we deal with a private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) which would prevent that from happening.

I am not questioning your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker; I accept it. We are talking in a broad sense about the family. The Government, in this legislation, claims that it is doing things for families. I am demonstrating to the Parliament that this Government is anti-family; that the Labor Party is essentially anti-family. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is a family person; I recognise that. When he speaks after me, let him demonstrate what this Government has done for families. Let him refute the fact that this Government has caused enormous damage to Australian families over the last 10 years. I challenge him to do that. The honourable member for Moreton and I have debated this matter before. The Government has gone way down the track in recognising de facto relationships. Even creeping into some of this legislation, in a debate we had recently, were homosexual relationships. What could be more anti-family than an approach that takes us down that track?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that these are sensitive issues and that many people do not want to talk about them. Many members of the Government may not want to talk about these issues because they are tough issues which require people to stand up here and make a stand on certain things. I am not frightened to do that, even if it is, to some extent, to my personal discomfort in some respects. I am concerned that, given the opportunity, the Labor Party will go further down this anti-family track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The left wing of the Labor Party is having some convulsions about the issue of homosexuality in the defence forces. Let us see Government members stand up and be counted on that. The encouragement of single parenthood is another anti-family position the Government has taken. It has made it easier and easier for single parents to exist. I am not saying that I am not compassionate enough to recognise that there are young women who are caught in that position who need to be taken care of, but we need to be very careful that the systems we put in place do not encourage that activity. I believe that we have allowed that to happen; this Government has allowed that to happen. The benefits that have been put in place are almost conducive to single parenthood, and I do not think that is supportive of the family at all.</PARA>

Fortunately, there will be a coalition government in this country by then&mdash;I hope there will be; otherwise I am not sure where we will be going. Assuming that there is a coalition government in place in 1994, we can expect great things from that year. Some of the objectives of that year, the key issues that have been discussed in the United Nations documents, are very exciting indeed. For instance, they talk about the family's role in the moral strength of society through the socialisation of children; the responsibilities of caring; the family's caring function; helping women and men combine family and vocational responsibilities; family violence and the need for protection and prevention; and the role of the family in teaching children values and behaviour that exemplify the equitable sharing of male and female roles. There are many things that we can look forward to in the International Year of the Family in 1994, and I hope that it will give us as a coalition in government an opportunity to really get back on track. </PARA>

The reason why we might suspect that it is being done is neither here nor there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It always seems to be my lot in life in this place that I get to follow the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and have to try to respond to some of his shallow and simplistic arguments that he trots out on every occasion. In this debate today on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) the honourable member for McPherson has brought in a whole lot of extraneous matter, absolutely nothing to do with the legislation. But I am more than happy to respond to his particular challenge to talk about the Labor Government's commitment to families as that is one of the areas of which we are most proud; we have a very proud record in government of achievements to assist families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson should look back in history at what his coalition government did for families and compare that with what this Government has done. For instance, in this legislation today we are dealing with family allowance payments. The coalition government sat back and allowed the real value of them to decline. It never increased them. It made an initial payment but never increased it with inflation. Those opposite allowed inflation to run rampant but never increased the allowance to keep pace with inflation. So the real value of those child endowment payments, as they were called then, declined considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until this Government came to power that we restructured the family allowance payment and gave it a considerable boost so that families now really do get a substantial level of income support to assist them with the additional costs of raising children. Not only have we restructured the family allowance payment so that it is a meaningful payment to assist families; we have also introduced an additional payment to help those low income families meet their real needs. That is called the family allowance supplement. I challenge the honourable member for McPherson to go and talk to the families in his electorate who receive that payment. I can assure him that they will all tell him that they are very appreciative of the family allowance supplement payment because it enables them to meet all the additional costs of raising a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is just one element of the package that this Government has introduced. We have done a number of things to assist families. Let us look at the opportunities we have provided in high school and tertiary education. These are figures that I know those on the other side of the House do not like to hear. We have almost doubled the number of students completing secondary school because we have provided them with financial support to enable that to happen. We provided Austudy so that families with low incomes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was responding to the honourable member for McPherson's challenge as to what we have done for families, and looking at this legislation as part of a total package to assist families. We must look at the Austudy payment as financial support for families because Austudy does enable students to continue their secondary education and therefore have some opportunity of going on to tertiary education. It helps the families with the cost of the children staying at high school. If we had not provided that support through Austudy, many families would not have been able to afford to allow their students to complete secondary schooling. That is very important assistance for families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also look at other things that this Government has done to assist families. One has been the provision of comprehensive universal health insurance in the form of Medicare. We have at least made families able to achieve affordable health care. We have provided access to the best health system in this country through Medicare. It means that all Australian families are able to comprehensively insure their families so that they are not out of pocket when they face medical problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most anti-family thing that I have ever seen or heard of in the last few years is the coalition's proposal to introduce a GST.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact is that the family allowance payments will be greatly eroded when families have to pay additional amounts of money, additional taxes, on all their food, clothing and services. In fact, those opposite would have to make some substantial increase in the family allowance and the family allowance supplement&mdash;way beyond what is proposed in Fightback&mdash;to pay for the additional costs. There is nothing more anti-family that I have ever heard of from any political party in this country than the GST because of what it will do to destroy family incomes and the capacity of families to provide for their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for McPherson has indicated, we are talking about two specific proposals to amend the Social Security Act. The first one that I would like to talk about relates to the amendments to the education leavers waiting periods. This will make a substantial improvement in the opportunities for young unemployed people to access income support arrangements within the community. The main purpose of the education leavers waiting periods is to encourage young people, particularly secondary school students, to remain in education by generally denying them access to income support during the long summer vacation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Amendment Bill introduces four modifications to the existing education leavers waiting period provisions in the Social Security Act of 1991. Allowing periods of part time and casual work to be taken into account when calculating a reduction in the ELWP will provide an incentive for young people to participate in the work force, even if only on a part time or casual basis, and thereby develop an early attachment to the work force. At present only full time work can be taken into account. We are now amending this so that part time and casual work can also be taken into account. That will provide an incentive for students to raise some of their own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, for example, a young school leaver were subject to a 13-week waiting period and worked, say, for 35 hours part time in the first two weeks of those 13 weeks, those 35 hours would reduce the waiting period by a week. Each additional seven hours worked over and above the 35 hours would reduce the waiting period by a day. So we are providing an incentive for young people to seek out part time and casual employment because it will reduce the waiting period that they have to face before they can go on to other levels of income support. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of reasons young school leavers are sometimes unaware of the need to register with the CES and apply for the Job Search allowance. This is because they may be badly informed of the requirements, often through word of mouth from other school leavers, may be unsure of their future education plans, or may simply misunderstand their obligation to register and apply. There have been outreach activities by the Department of Social Security, such as school visits, which have been successful in assisting young school leavers to understand their social security rights and responsibilities. I think this is a pattern that we need to encourage and increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first change in the Bill is expected to benefit some 2,000 young people who gain part time or casual employment, and it will cost an estimated $1.4m in 1992-93. The second change addresses the problem of the 13-week waiting period applicable to secondary school leavers, and it will commence from the day after they cease education or on 15 February in the following year, whichever is the earlier. This will, in a way, protect young school leavers from missing out on income support due to their ignorance or misunderstanding of the current requirements. Currently, Job Search allowance and sickness allowance claimants who leave full time education of at least six months duration must serve a waiting period of 13 weeks for single people under 21 without dependants and six weeks for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment will provide that a waiting period will not need to be served when an income support recipient undertakes a course of education of six months or more but returns to income support within 12 months of cancellation of the earlier social security payment. This change will provide an additional incentive for Job Search or Newstart recipients to undertake longer term education without having to serve another waiting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final change will enable a person subject to a waiting period who qualifies for special benefit to go straight onto the Job Search allowance. At present, such a person would be subject to the stringent special benefit income test and be transferred to Job Search at the end of a waiting period. Being required to satisfy the more stringent income test during the waiting period could dissuade people from taking up part time or casual employment. All of these changes are designed to reduce the waiting periods for young unemployed people who have left full time education and who may be seeking to go on to Job Search while they are looking for full time employment. It will enable them to have a much greater opportunity to access the training and income support programs provided through DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the Bill is related to, as the honourable member for McPherson pointed out, the lump sum advance on family allowance. The honourable member for McPherson tried to outline some great conspiracy theories about the motivation behind this, but he does not understand that this is simply a measure to introduce greater flexibility. The great success of the additional payment that we made in April was that it enabled families to pay off the sizeable bills that often confront them from time to time during the year, particularly bills that relate to family expenses such as for clothing and the schoolbooks that they need to get their children into higher education or even into the non-compulsory secondary education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do here is give families much greater flexibility so that, if they choose&mdash;and the major point that we need to stress is that it is a choice for them; they can opt to seek it or they can choose not to&mdash;to ask for a certain amount in a lump sum they can then use that amount to pay off a large bill at any one time. We are not saying that we will give them all their family allowance at once. There is a limit&mdash;a maximum of $136.50&mdash;that they can take, but it means that at least they will be able to use that amount of money to pay off a sizeable bill at that time. The rest of the family allowance will still be paid to them in that monthly instalment so that they can use it for the ongoing costs of feeding and clothing their families. It will allow them to budget, knowing that twice a year they are able to get that lump sum and use it to pay off specific bills. I think this measure emphasises the flexibility that we are trying to introduce into our income support programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government recognises that the comprehensive network of income support programs managed through the Department of Social Security meets the needs of some 4 1/2 million people. To adequately manage such a program, and to provide for the range of different needs that exist within that client group, the processes and programs that we implement have to be more flexible. This strategy of providing families with the chance to take part of their family allowance in a lump sum twice a year is a clear demonstration of that flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the Opposition is not opposed to it, but it always tries to score cheap political points and make out that there is some conspiracy surrounding this. There is no conspiracy. It is a measure that has been widely accepted throughout the community and throughout the interest groups that are involved with the social security system. They have all supported it and believe that it is a worthwhile measure. I believe that this House should give its full support to it. It is quite consistent with the Government's social justice strategy, and it demonstrates a continued commitment to provide support for families that is much more accessible and which will enhance their lives and their capacity to meet the needs of their families. We need to provide an income support program which gives added incentive for families to improve their budgeting and their capacity to meet their various needs as they arise during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure affecting waiting periods for education leavers was part of the youth statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made in July and was contained in the Budget. This family allowance measure was also announced in the Budget and will greatly enhance the opportunities for families to better access their family allowance payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about another measure that was included in the social security element of the Budget, and it is something that we will be proposing legislation on in the near future; that is, the extension in the Budget of fringe benefits to part pensioners. I believe that was also a very important part of the social security package contained in the Budget, as this measure will greatly enhance the opportunities for older Australians. I am one of a number of people on both sides of the House who have been seeking such an extension of fringe benefits to part pensioners, and I am delighted that the Government has been able to accede to our requests and include this provision in the Budget announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will go a long way towards improving the situation for many part pensioners, as has been stated in this House by a number of people. Pensioners, particularly part pensioners who receive some of their income from investments, have suffered because of declining interest rates. Their investments are no longer earning the amount of money that they previously were. The fall in interest rates has benefited the vast majority of Australians, but those who rely on interest for their income have suffered. This Government has recognised that point by extending all fringe benefits that operate within the Commonwealth sphere&mdash;and that mainly relates to the health services that are provided and telephone assistance plus assistance from the National Acoustic Laboratory&mdash;to those people who are only part pensioners, who get part of their income from private sources and part from the social security system. That will greatly improve their actual standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another measure that I think we need to be considering which I have raised with the Government, as have a number of other members, and that is the need to examine closely the taxation arrangements for all retired Australians. At the moment pensioners have a concessional tax threshold which is higher than the normal tax threshold, but that is applicable only to pensioners. Many of my constituents who are self-funded retirees have said to me that they believe it is a discriminatory practice that one set of older Australians is eligible for a higher tax threshold than another set of older Australians. They believe that this matter needs to be closely examined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this matter with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), and have sought for the Government to examine this. It would be an expensive measure. It is something that we would need to phase in over time, but I believe it is something that we need to do. If we are going to have a fair social security system, a fair retirement income system in this country for all older Australians, we need to make sure that there is no discrimination in that practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two major amendments that we are dealing with today are good news for Australians. They are good news for people who have finished schooling and who are about to enter the work force, and good news for all families because they will give them greater flexibility. I commend the Government for introducing these measures. I particularly commend the Minister at the table, the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), for his initiative in implementing these family allowance amendments because I think they show a greater level of creativity and flexibility in the implementation of government income support programs. I believe we will find that a lot of Australian families will take the option of being paid a lump sum. The payment that we made in April demonstrates that there are particular times during the year when families need that lump sum extra payment to help them get over certain large bills. I think that the vast majority of families will access this additional system that we have provided and make use of the family allowance lump sum. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one particular point of interest arising from the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2), which are before the House today. If nothing else, the legislation to amend the family allowance arrangements highlights the Government's acceptance that things are quite crook in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Government acknowledges that many Australian families have never been worse off. Many parents are struggling to make ends meet and to provide even the bare necessities of life for their families, although this is hardly surprising when one considers that close to one million Australians are currently out of work. It is a long time since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) apologised for causing all this hardship. I suppose today's legislation goes some of the way towards easing his conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, while I am sure that the new family allowance arrangements will assist in some ways, these changes will do absolutely nothing to resolve the complex economic problems causing such widespread unemployment and family hardship. Although I do not oppose this legislation, I would far prefer this House to be discussing the sorts of economic reforms which would encourage new investment in Australia and new jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these proposed changes to the family allowance mean for Australian families? The legislation puts into effect a Budget proposal to enable people on the family allowance to request lump sum advances for half their family allowance entitlements at the one child rate for six months up to a maximum of $135.85. Of course, this means that the regular fortnightly payments would be reduced accordingly, but this measure, by providing lump sum payments, undoubtedly will help some people who might be having difficulty budgeting for regular household bills or unexpected financial burdens such as health expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this measure takes effect on 1 January 1993 the name `family allowance' will also be changed to `family payment', and I assume that the current family allowance recipients will be advised of the changes around that time. One does not have to be too cynical to suggest that the timing of this change seems to fit well with the likelihood of a Federal election early next year. However, coming from a Government hell-bent on reversing its dismal electoral fortunes, the timing and nature of these changes come as no surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has had a whole decade to help Australian families to improve their standards of living, but instead it has crippled the Australian economy, creating the worst recession in 60 years and increasing unemployment to record levels. Now, with an election looming on the horizon, the Government is trying to pull a bunny out of the hat. I am sure that many low income Australian families will take advantage of the new family payment measure. They may even be grateful for the changes put forward by the Government, but they will not be fooled by them. The Australian public knows who is to blame for the mess this country is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the last election the Labor Government presided over an economy which had already seen some 510,000 people out of work. Today that figure has increased by a staggering 86 per cent. There are now some 947,500 Australians who cannot find a job. The figure is getting close to one million. That is just the official figure. We all know that thousands more have given up all hope of finding work and have opted out of the work force, while others have gone into some form of educational training, fearing the worst if they are left to venture into the job market today. Amongst the worst affected are young Australians, with more than one-third of all teenagers looking for full time work and many more hidden by the nature of the official statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as unemployment is concerned, Western Australia is one of the worst affected States. Last week's unemployment figures were nothing short of a disaster, the State still reeling from a decade of Labor's economic mismanagement. The unemployment rate has continued to increase in Western Australia, going from 10.4 per cent in June to 10.8 per cent in July, and now rising to a postwar record of 11.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the true situation is far worse. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed that more than 19,000 unemployed Western Australians do not show up on the official figures. Some 14,000 people are classified as `discouraged job seekers'. In other words, they have simply given up looking for work, often after months of actively pursuing employment, often with hundreds of applicants for each job vacancy. A further 5,000 Western Australians are recorded as actively seeking work but are unable to start within a four week period. Because of this they are not officially classified as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 19,000, according to the figures, on top of the State's current level of unemployment gives us a clearer picture of the true unemployment situation, in which around 118,000 Western Australians are out of work. This translates to an unemployment rate of not 11.5 per cent as per the official Government statistics but a staggering 13.4 per cent. Furthermore, this figure does not include the number of unemployed people in job training schemes or small business owners and farmers who are working for no income or, worse still, at a loss. It would not surprise me if the genuine unemployment rate in Western Australia was around 15 per cent and it is only a couple of months before the next year's school leavers start to flood onto the job market and swell the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is the best the Government can do to relieve the enormous financial pressures on families, especially those in low income groups and the unemployed. These bandaid measures are not enough, especially when one considers that the Government is unable to put in place the ongoing economic reforms this country needs so desperately to generate new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National coalition will not oppose these changes, but it is particularly interesting to consider our alternatives for assisting Australian families, especially those on low incomes. We start by considering the family allowance scheme itself, which we accept has become a valuable supplement to a family's take-home pay. The coalition's Fightback plan offers significant real help for families, including a doubling of the family allowance payments for families on less than $30,000 a year and a range of other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that, whereas the Government's changes next January will enable a family on less than $30,000 to obtain lump sum payments of $135.85, Fightback would double this amount. In fact, on current rates the family in this situation would be able to receive a lump sum payment of $271.70 under Fightback. Quite clearly, this will be of far more direct assistance than the amount being offered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other households on higher incomes will also benefit under Fightback. Our intention is to give most assistance to low income earners who have been hard hit by a decade of Labor and Labor Government incompetence; for example, families on an annual income of between $30,000 and $40,000 will be eligible for a six monthly lump sum payment of $203.78 under Fightback compared with $135.85 under the Government's proposals. Even those relatively well off families on incomes of up to $55,000 will gain, as their lump sums will be paid at the rate of $146 rather than the Government's $135.85 payment. The bottom line is that the coalition's alternative for low income families is literally twice as good as the Government's scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, families in receipt of the family payment should realise that the Government is not increasing their payment under the changes being debated today. The lump sum payments are not additional payments but represent a brought-forward amount. On the other hand, we can be certain that the Government is planning a hidden tax agenda in the highly unlikely event that it is re-elected, enabling it to clawback money from families and businesses to help fund the nation's exploding Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits for Australian families planned under Fightback go much further, as I have described. Families with working parents will be much better off when the coalition's income tax cuts are introduced and their take-home pay is increased significantly. Indeed, Fightback will slash personal income tax by around 30 per cent, saving Australians a massive $13 billion. The tax free threshold will be raised, freeing at least another 320,000 low income earners from having to pay tax at all. Marginal tax rates will be much lower so that an average employee will be able to earn considerably more money without paying a higher tax rate. For example, a person on a typical wage of $25,000 currently pays tax at a marginal rate of 38c in the dollar, whereas under Fightback he or she will pay tax at a rate of only 30c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the same person could even double his wage&mdash;not by a secret tax agenda, I might add&mdash;at the 30 per cent rate under the Fightback plan, compared with 46 per cent under the Government's present tax scales. It is no wonder that so many Australian workers are reluctant to work overtime to help support their families when, for example, they know that nearly half their extra earnings will be taken in tax. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback gives them the initiative to work that overtime by rewarding them with lower tax rates, so that their take home pay will be far greater. Our commitments to double family allowances, to increase the family allowance supplement by 6 per cent, and to index the dependent spouse rebate, are other examples of our commitment to the financial well-being of Australian families. So, too, is our plan to scrap fuel excise, thereby reducing petrol prices by around 19c a litre, or $11 for every tankful of fuel for the family car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our decision to put aside $90m for increased child-care support is particularly important for many families with both parents in the work force, and who are currently finding it hard to find suitable child-care for their children. Fightback is totally pro-family. This is firmly demonstrated in our new approach towards health policy, which gives generous tax credits for lower and middle income families to help them afford the benefits of private health cover insurance. For example, families on very low incomes, of below $12,000, will be eligible to a credit of $400 annually. Furthermore, the cost of health care will actually fall under the full impact of the Fightback plan. So while the Government tinkers around with the family allowance scheme, the coalition has come up with a comprehensive package to assist Australian families in a variety of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of how Fightback helps families is by reforming the education system. We believe that parents should be able to play a greater role in the education of their children. Consequently, the emphasis will be on a change from the system which funds the institutions to one which is more responsive to the needs of the individual. In turn, this will promote the quality of education, further strengthening the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the plight of the many thousands of Australian families which are directly affected by the present unemployment crisis. With 10.9 per cent of the work force officially recognised as being unemployed&mdash;and the real situation, undoubtedly, far worse than that&mdash;there are few people whose families are not affected, or who do not know a friend, relative, or workmate who has not lost his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House today, the Social Security Amendment Bill, does nothing to assist these families in the most constructive way possible&mdash;by creating jobs. As I said earlier, this will not happen until major economic reforms are put in place. Nor will the Government's measures in this legislation do anything constructive to relieve the various side-effects of the chronic unemployment we suffer in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families are becoming increasingly affected by the spiralling crime rates, for example, as many people become more frustrated and more desperate and turn to crime in the face of long term unemployment and lack of genuine opportunities. The key to helping families and creating job opportunities is to restart the business sector&mdash;especially, small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian enterprises desperately need a reduction in operating cost to improve their viability and, in many cases, to prevent actual bankruptcy. Instead, the Government has fired a barrage of new costs at the business sector, including the superannuation guarantee charge, which will add 3 per cent to payroll costs, rising eventually to 12 per cent. It has been estimated that this will result in 60,000 to 100,000 jobs losses over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, from my discussions with a range of business proprietors, I am aware of many instances whereby businesses cannot support these extra costs and, as a result, must allow some employees to go. Businesses have cut their own operating costs to the bone to keep afloat. These extra costs cannot be absorbed in any other way. It is hardly the way to promote job security and to assist families. As well as that, there is the ridiculous training levy, which will do little to promote a comprehensive national training effort, but which has impacted adversely on business cash flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel excise tax, which now raises $7.26 billion in revenue from private and business motorists, imposes significant costs on the business sector, as do other taxes, such as the wholesale sales tax and the capital gains tax. The answer to reducing business costs and generating new employment opportunities is to ease this burden on business. This is why the Fightback plan abolishes fuel excise, scraps sales tax, gives capital gains tax concessions, throws the training levy out the window, and pegs the superannuation guarantee charges at the rate applicable at the next election. All in all, seven taxes on business will be abolished, and total savings of $20 billion will be passed on. One tax which will go completely, of course, is payroll tax. This is nothing more than a tax on employment, which has contributed towards the nation's current unemployment crisis. There is no rhyme or reason to why payroll tax can be supported any longer, but there are plenty of good reasons for getting rid of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, it has been estimated that 175,000 new jobs would be created. That would take care of nearly 20 per cent of the nation's unemployment, and have more impact on family living standards than any reshuffling of Government programs, such as family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As before honourable members on the opposite side scoff at any assessment of the impact of the proposed initiatives. Let me remind them of what the Prime Minister once said. He is reported to have boasted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Labor would solve the immediate problem of unemployment by taking at least 150,000 to 200,000 people off the dole queue with its reduction in payroll tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That was 15 years ago, and, quite clearly, the impact of a total abolition of payroll tax today would be far greater. Recently, in response to Western Australia's continuing unemployment climb, I called on the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, to take steps to scrap payroll tax. It would show genuine courage if she were at least to put the interests of Western Australians before her own political objectives by enabling bipartisan support for the aim of the coalition's Fightback plan&mdash;to abolish payroll tax. After all, it was Premier Lawrence who pointed out how payroll tax is so unfair, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It doesn't matter how profitable the business, payroll tax simply relates to the number of people that you employ.</PARA>
<PARA>She has even described the tax as bizarre, and has labelled it as a tax on employment. But paying lip service to the problem is not enough. Australian families deserve more than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second piece of legislation being debated today concerns various changes to free up access to benefits in the wake of the July Youth Summit. While these measures may encourage a number of young people to remain in education, they will do nothing to resolve the fundamental problems facing our youth today. With statistics showing that one in three teenagers is out of work, and that many more are frightened to take chances in the labour market, it is imperative that the Government take action to create new job opportunities for our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's legislation is tinkering at the edges. Meaningful inroads cannot be made until the reforms that I have mentioned earlier are put into place. Also, to encourage youth training and employment, it is essential to reform the nation's industrial relations system, which all too often discriminates against young people. For example, why would a hotel manager employ an inexperienced 21-year-old when the present system requires the same wage to be paid as if the employee had been an older and more experienced person. This is just one anomaly in the system which discriminates against youth, and has helped create a vacuum in youth employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback sets out to free up the present system of industrial relations and presents a comprehensive approach to vocational training to encourage employers to take on young people, train them, and give them permanent jobs. This has to be better than the fiddling around the edges of the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the coalition does not oppose this legislation. But we make the point that much more needs to be done to help Australian families, to give the young people of this country the opportunity they are entitled to and which we on election to Parliament as their elected representatives owe them. </PARA>

I would hope and expect that, given the far-ranging debate that has taken place with respect to these Bills, no-one will call any spurious points of order on me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first speaker for the Opposition on this Bill was, of course, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the shadow Minister for social security. He said that he agreed with the legislation but then went on with the usual diatribe as to how the world would be a much better place in which to live with the Opposition in control. How all this is going to happen, I do not know. How all of a sudden the Opposition is going to create two million jobs, I do not know. It will certainly not be by imposing a 15 per cent goods and services tax. The shadow Minister suggested that under an opposition government all these particular improvements that we are putting into the social security system would not be necessary, simply because their government could create two million jobs and all the rest of it. I think most people in the community would realise that the Opposition is just living in fairyland. I do not think one could say more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has stated on numerous occasions, the Government is obviously not happy with the present rate of unemployment, but it is probably no worse than in the rest of the world. It is not as if we are Robinson Crusoe in terms of unemployment. There is a recession throughout the world. But how do we respond as a government? We try to do something. We try to bring in further improvements in social security and other areas so that those people who are affected by the recession, those people who are on low incomes and those who are finding it difficult to live with children will find their lives a little bit easier. We do this by bringing in initiatives of the kind that are the subject of these Bills. What would the Opposition do? The Opposition would scrap a lot of the things that we are doing now. The Opposition would bring in the $3.50 youth slave wage; it would privatise the Department of Social Security; it would throw out the unemployed after nine months on the Job Search allowance and tell them that they have to go and find a job even if there are no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could end up with the situation, as the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) said, which exists in America, where there are a lot of unemployed people living out in the cold, warming their hands over 44-gallon drums. What would those opposite do with people who cannot find a job after nine months and are thrown off income support? The reality is that those people have to survive and live somehow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) was the next Opposition speaker. I tried to put down a few notes as to how I would debate him, but I ended up putting down, `Mainly carried on with a lot of waffle'. There was nothing that I could debate him on, because he did not say anything. He talked about everything but these Bills before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), talked about the Fightback proposals for family allowance as if they were going to be some big deal. All of a sudden these families are going to be rich because of Fightback, that magic document which is going to fix everything. Let us have a look at the Fightback proposals in so far as they affect the question of family allowances. Those opposite would introduce tough income testing arrangements, slashing the upper income limit for family allowance from $64,000 to $55,000 for a family with one child. In this scenario, some 107,000 families would lose under the Opposition's proposals&mdash;and this is just a conservative estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the cost of raising children, many double income families would lose, especially when faced with the increasing expenses of child-care. Around 90 per cent of families with children are presently eligible for family allowance compared to only 75 per cent who would be eligible under Fightback. That means 15 per cent of Australians would have food taken out of their mouths or out of the mouths of their children. Of course, that number has a certain ring to it. Those opposite would knock off 15 per cent of families who are trying to feed their kids and lay on an impost of 15 per cent in the form of a tax that would take more food out of the mouths of the needy and put it in the mouths of the well off. Under Fightback those remaining on the family allowance would face a more complex means test which would be difficult to administer and difficult for families to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, in recent years this Government has dedicated itself to simplifying the process of delivering social security services to its clients, as is demonstrated by the integration of the family and child payments into one payment as and from 1 January next year. The Opposition's proposed changes to family allowances would introduce significant poverty traps for families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000. This would introduce disincentives for some middle income Australian families to increase their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition's family payment proposals are the classic three-card trick. Those opposite talk about us tricking. They would increase payments but tighten the income test and the definition of `income' so that hundreds of thousands of families would lose. That is not so with us. The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) will help people during their times of need by improving client services, which I will talk about in a second&mdash;in this case giving families a much needed advance to buy school books, uniforms and other items that come in a cluster at a particular time of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest brought up another matter which I need to address. It did not really have a lot to do with this issue. Nevertheless something needs to be pointed out. He talked about all these taxes that marvellously all of a sudden are going to be abolished because of Fightback. I note that the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) has come into the chamber. I do not think the honourable member, a good fellow, believes in the Fightback package either, but I am glad he is here. I would like to talk about the abolition of one of those taxes, the fuel excise. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) is running around the country all the time saying, `Don't worry about zero tariffs, et cetera, because we are going to knock out the fuel excise'. Let us be realistic about this fuel excise. It is something people need to think about. The figure those opposite talk about is something like a saving of 19c a litre. Does anyone really believe that, should that mob opposite get into government and abolish the fuel excise, the oil companies will not come in for their chop? Does anyone really believe that those greedy oil companies, some of which have economies probably as big as the whole of Australia, will not come in and say, `Oh, the Government has given us a bit of a bonus, 19c a litre off fuel. Can we get our grubby little hands on it?'. How often do we go around to service stations and see 55c, 65c and 80c or whatever? In Queensland it is down to 59c at the moment. When they want to increase their market share they are prepared to knock the price down and they raise it when they want to. I do not know about those opposite, but I do not trust the oil companies to do the right thing in terms of the 19c. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the service station proprietors throughout Australia have it pretty tough. They get something like a lousy 1c or 2c out of every litre of fuel that they get rid of. </PARA>

Do those opposite think they can trust those people to pass on the whole savings that are being talked about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, how can we trust the State governments not to introduce a fuel tax. I do not think the Queensland Government ever would. The guys up there are too good. There is no way in the world they would do that. But most other States have done it. We cannot guarantee that there will always be a Goss Labor government in Queensland. There might be for 20 years, but in 25 years time an opposition government might come in and the first thing it would do is introduce a fuel excise. Does anybody really believe that the savings as a result of abolishing the fuel tax are going to be passed on to the consumer? If they do, they believe in fairies and they could be sold anything. They could probably be sold the Storey Bridge and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are yet another example of how this Government targets those most in need, as distinct from those opposite, who intend to turn social security recipients into targets and knock them off the Job Search allowance, and to abandon the great record in client services that this Government has achieved over the past few years. I want to talk about the question of client services within the Department of Social Security. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) has just walked in. She was on the same committee with me when we were backbenchers. We were on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I remember going around the country with the Minister looking at these things and checking the situation out for ourselves. As part of this inquiry we looked at the way the Department of Social Security delivered its services. I have to admit that at that time there were a lot of deficiencies in client service delivery. We had endless stories from welfare agencies and from people who accessed the services saying that there were long queues and they were not being treated right by young people at the counter&mdash;that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came down with a report which was later known as the O'Keefe report, named after our chairperson. As a result of that, I am very proud to say, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, that most of those initiatives&mdash;indeed, nearly all of them&mdash;have been introduced by the Department. In one office of the Department of Social Security in Sydney there would be violence because people had to wait, they were dispirited and so forth. No-one likes to have to go to the Department of Social Security to ask for help, but it is a fact of life these days. People would walk into this particular office and be very upset. It certainly would not take them long to get hot under the collar and there were even cases of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that people now get dressed up to go to that same office because the surroundings are so nice and because they are treated so well by the staff. The whole staff arrangements have been restructured in such a way that decision makers are now at the counter. We have been able to introduce such things as on-line processing. We have done all sorts of things. We have computerised the whole Department. We have in the Department one of the best computer systems certainly in Australia and probably in the world. We have been doing these things because we understand that people taken out of employment or retrenched through no fault of their own sometimes need help. There has to be an income support system to act as a safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in a number of client service initiatives in the Department of Social Security. One of the ones that I am the most proud of is our current youth pilot projects, where we try to get our services to young people in the community. I am not talking about the street kids. I am not talking about those children who have a home to go to but do not want to go home, who want to do whatever they want to do around the streets; I am talking about the genuine homeless youth. I am talking about those kids that leave home because they are forced to. Believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are thousands of them. For better or for worse, that is the way things are at the moment. The fact is that there are a lot of single parent families, marriage breakdowns, divorces, and that sort of thing. Sometimes the children are forced to leave home because of breakdown in the relationship, breakdown of the marriage or simply because a new partner comes into the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members that the vast majority of fair dinkum homeless youth&mdash;I am not talking about street kids; there is a difference&mdash;are kids that have been forced to leave and are not welcome to come back into the home. What happens to these children, some as young as 13 or 14?  Not long ago I attended the official opening by the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, at a place on the Gold Coast called MacLaughlin House, which is a sort of halfway house. There was a lovely young lass there who looked about 15 or 16. I said to the social workers, `How come she is here?'. They said, `We found her huddled up in a phone box last night because she had been forced to leave home'. So I went up to her and said, `Why did you leave home?'. I will not say here why she did, but the reason certainly was not very nice. She was forced to leave home as she was scared of her stepfather. The point is that these are the sorts of things that go on. Whether or not we close our eyes to these things, they are happening out in the community, even on the Gold Coast, which is supposed to be one of the richest places in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Department of Social Security we are trialing across the country youth pilot projects where we have social workers and people that are experienced in working with youth going out in the community to talk to the kids, to stop them, if possible, from getting into such things as crime, prostitution and all this sort of thing simply to survive, and to let them know that under certain circumstances they are entitled to some help from the Government. We do this in a number of areas. I hope that in due course, after the pilot projects are finished, we may be in a position to expand them as a permanent feature of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons these projects are working so well is that we have 400-odd social workers working in our Department. Under the Fightback proposals, those opposite would privatise the positions of social workers. They would privatise them out. I want to tell the House the sort of work that social workers do. It is relevant to the Bills that are before the House in the sense that the social workers are there to help people access some of the payments made by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell those opposite some of the things that social workers do. These are the people who would find themselves without a job should the Opposition get into government. It does not understand exactly what social workers do. I quote from a list of key points written by Robyn Holt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Social workers play an essential part in the Department's income support and labour force related services.</PARA>
<PARA>The words `and labour force related services' are very important, because they mean that these social workers can not only say to a person who might not have a job or who has to ask for some sort of a payment, `Look, here's your money. You're entitled to it', but also direct the person to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and other areas where we might be able to get him or her a job. The list continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Social workers undertake social assessments and provide reports to help administrative staff make complex eligibility decisions required in delivering the Department's programs. This involvement in the decision making of the Department greatly assists in minimising the cost of reviews and appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.They assist clients through the initial crisis of family rejection and separation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what I have been talking about&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">retrenchment, onset of serious illness and/or disability and the difficulty of managing on a sudden reduction of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.They assist clients to obtain secure accommodation, to consolidate debts and to retain essential services such as water supply, lighting and heating in their homes. They link clients to other support services in the community. This assistance enhances clients' ability and motivation to participate in the labour force when the crisis has passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Social workers help the Department's public contact staff . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Because of the extensive network of DSS regional offices social workers are located in rural and isolated communities. Frequently they are the only professional services available in these directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The location of social workers throughout the DSS network means that they can be quickly deployed to help people after natural disasters.</PARA>
<PARA>It reminds me&mdash;and I know the honourable member for Fairfax, who is sitting at the table, will remember this&mdash;of the 1990 Charleville floods. I think that happened around May 1990. I had only recently been appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department, so I thought, `Well, we've got to go out there and do something for these people'. They were really down and out. They were in a tent city. There were helicopters flying around the place. It was unbelievable. I thought I was watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">MASH</EMPHASIS>. The fact is that it was bedlam there. I got onto my area manager at the time and I said, `Look, we need to do something on this quickly'. He said, `We've already got it in hand'. So what happened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went out there immediately on one of those Hercules aircraft with the area manager and a lady by the name of Desley Hargreaves, who was the chief social worker. She and I, with Mr Whitelaw&mdash;I think he was a deputy manager&mdash;took a little portable computer to the area and set up a shopfront. This chief social worker for the area central office, or whatever it was at the time, spoke to the people themselves and said, `How can we help you?'. We provided them with income support because they were desperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time has almost finished. I have not said too much about these Bills, but there is not that much to say about them, apart from the fact that they are really good initiatives. I want to place on record the fantastic work that is done by the social workers in the Department of Social Security, who are many times forgotten in the whole context of things. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that under this Government social workers will still be there to assist those people that need help. We are not about to throw them out and privatise them. If somebody came up to the counter in a situation of distress and asked for some help, under the Opposition's proposals we would have to say to them, `You'd better go out because you'll have to go and see them. They're up at some accountant's office because they've been privatised'. I commend these Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) because, unlike him, I intend to spend some time talking about the Social Security Amendment Bill. What is quite obvious from the Bill and from the discussions and interjections of Government members is that what we have now is a little more of the `big bribe' technique which is so favoured by the Government in these times of very real hardship. But in reality it is only a little bribe because it is providing access to funds from next January&mdash;that ties in well with an election in February or March&mdash;so that people can request a lump sum advance of half their six-month allowance at the first child rate of up to $135.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what is significant about that is that it is people's own money. It is not as though the Government is giving them anything; it is their own money and they have an option of one advance every six months. I suppose the concept of lump sum advances is more or less all right in order to help low income people meet unexpected one-off payments. But people have to realise that having received that, their allowance is reduced by half for the next six months. I believe we need to draw the line. The family allowance is designed to supplement wages in order to meet family needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Government passed a Bill in May which enabled family allowance payments to be paid on alternative weeks to payments of pensions or benefits. It was claimed&mdash;and I certainly support it&mdash;that this would ensure that poorer families with children had access to four cash payments each month. The impact of this legislation is that by assisting people with a lump sum it will actually reduce the number of payments that people receive on an ongoing basis. We supported this earlier proposal as it provided a better cash flow and assisted people who may have had difficulty in budgeting for household expenditure over a two-week period. I point out that while many families on welfare do face one-off debts&mdash;for example, health costs&mdash;we would not support any further extension allowing access to larger sums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family allowance was intended as a supplement to wages policy because wages do not take account of family responsibilities. Family allowance was not intended as a series of lump sum payments. It must not be turned into a series of lump sum payments&mdash;in other words, buy-offs of people. Obviously, the Government's intention is to make it look better than it actually is. It is quite obvious that the Government has no new ideas on how to improve Australia's standard of living so it has come up with some very crafty imagery. It is selling something old as something new. As I have said, people will get their own money in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all remember the One Nation family bonus payment. It went down well at the time, but it has not left Australian families any better off in the long run and it did not go very far.

In May, 215,000 two-parent families had one or both parents unemployed. There were 225,000 single parent families where the parent had no job. That is a disastrous situation.

We will increase the family allowance by 50 per cent for families earning between $30,000 and $40,000 a year. The Government is not going anywhere near that; it is not increasing it at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will amend the taxation law to implement personal tax cuts from 1994-95, and for subsequent income years, as outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation statement of 26 February 1992. This gives effect to the Government's commitment to deliver on these tax reductions without resort to the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. It adds to this Government's unparalleled record in introducing progressive reform of the taxation system and confirms Australia's position under this Government as a fair and low tax country. In 1990, taking account of all levels of government, Australia had the third lowest tax burden in the OECD. Only the United States and Turkey have a lower burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax Cuts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reductions in the tax rates will be implemented in two stages from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. New scales of personal tax rates for incomes within the range $20,700 to $50,000 will operate from 1 July 1994. Further reductions in those rates will apply from 1 January 1996. The Bill contains the rate scales to apply for 1994-95, 1996-97 and subsequent income years. As the second reduction in personal tax rates has effect from 1 January 1996, the Bill also contains a composite rate scale for the 1995-96 income year. That scale is obtained from an average of the tax rates to apply from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reductions will result in the current 38 per cent rate for the income range $20,700 to $36,000 being reduced to 30 per cent over a two-year period. The income range will also be widened. After two years, the new 30 per cent rate will apply to the income range $20,700 to $40,000, some $4,000 wider than the current range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current 46 per cent rate for the income range $36,000 to $50,000 will be reduced to 40 per cent over the same period with a corresponding reduction of $4,000 in the income range to a range of $40,000 to $50,000. This means that for someone earning $28,000 a year, for example, the tax cuts will increase disposable income by about $11 a week. The tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 July 1994. For the forward estimate years, the cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $3.2 billion in 1994-95 and $5.2 billion in 1995-96. The measures I am introducing today are an integral part of the Government's tax reform agenda as detailed in the statement on tax policy which I propose to table today. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal Responsibility</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget, the Government indicated its desire to reduce the deficit in 1995-96 to between half and one per cent of GDP after allowing for the cuts to personal income tax. It is possible this outcome could be achieved without resort to any additional revenue measures. The Government did, however, identify three possible measures which could be considered, if necessary, to yield in excess of $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the statement on tax policy the Government outlines measures which will have the net effect of reducing the deficit by $2 billion in 1995-96. But in order to put this issue beyond doubt, the Government has gone further and by advancing the date of implementation of those measures the deficit will be reduced by $4.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. In this way the Government will pursue sensible tax reform based on fairness and efficiency but will also bolster the stance of fiscal policy. The consequence of this action is that the Government is confident that the deficit reduction program implicit in the Budget will be exceeded during the course of the forward estimate years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax Reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the Government has radically transformed the taxation system into a more effective, more efficient and fairer system. In the 1990s, the Government will maintain the effectiveness of the existing tax system to meet new challenges and to fund the vital activities of government in providing for the security and development of our nation and the well-being of the people. The Government's taxation policies have consistently produced more equitable sharing of the tax burden and lower marginal tax rates. These policies have been pursued both through changes to the design of the income tax and through the continuous improvement of tax administration and compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, we considered and rejected the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax and opted instead to make taxes on the income base more efficient and equitable. In particular, we introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which are directed at previously untaxed income received by predominantly high income individuals. Other reforms have been introduced progressively to increase the effectiveness of tax administration and to improve tax compliance. This program has included the introduction of self-assessment of income tax&mdash;supported by substantially upgraded audit programs&mdash;the introduction of the tax file number system and other information reporting, modernisation of tax compliance through a major new computer acquisition program matched with organisational changes in the Tax Office and the reorientation of the Tax Office towards a revision of information and advisory services to taxpayers to assist them in meeting their tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy approach has resulted in a broader income base and reduced tax evasion and reduced tax avoidance. This approach has enabled the Government to reduce, substantially, marginal tax rates. Since 1983 the top rate has been lowered from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and the bottom rate has been cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the Government has introduced a range of measures particularly to assist low income earners. For example, cuts to personal income tax rates in January 1991 raised the threshold at which tax is payable from $5,100 to $5,400 and reduced the bottom marginal tax rate from 21c to 20c in the dollar. At the same time, the income level up to which the bottom rate applies was extended from $17,650 to $20,700. By contrast, when this Government took office in 1983, the tax free threshold was set just below $5,000 and the bottom marginal rate of 30c in the dollar applied to incomes up to $19,500, and above that level the rate was 46c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government introduced the family allowance supplement, which provides substantial support for low income families. In the One Nation statement, the Government provided further assistance for low income families by way of increases in FAS of $3 a week per child from the first payday in April 1992. FAS boosts the disposable income of eligible families by up to $60.80 a fortnight for each child aged up to 13 years and to $85.90 for each child aged between 13 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the benefits to taxpayers, income tax rate reductions effected by this Government have supported other initiatives by reducing the incentive to avoid or evade tax. In keeping with this broad tax policy strategy since 1983 of making the income tax fair and of reducing evasion, the Government is now undertaking two further initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the fringe benefits tax significantly improved the equity of the tax system because it provided a means of ensuring that income provided in kind was taxed. The FBT was designed with a variety of administrative considerations in mind. The Government believes that it is now appropriate to improve the effectiveness of the FBT, and considerably enhance the fairness of the tax system, by changing the method of calculating the value base of the tax by making it as near to that of income tax as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other legislation I am introducing today provides that, from April 1994, the fringe benefits tax will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefit and FBT payments will be deductible to the employer for income tax purposes. This is equivalent to the tax treatment of salary, where the employee pays income tax on the gross amount of salary and the employer has a tax deduction equal to the gross amount of that salary. The change to the valuation of the FBT base will raise about $2.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early introduction of this important legislation will ensure that employers and employees have ample notice of the significant changes to the fringe benefits tax structure. A significant share of the revenue yield of the changes will come from tax exempt government sector employers who have benefited from lower taxes on fringe benefits until now. The Government will discuss this issue with State and Territory governments and local government in the context of the general purpose funding and the next Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not considering any other changes to the FBT. In particular, we do not propose to alter the classes of FBT exempt organisations, so that religious institutions and public benevolent institutions will continue to be exempt. Special arrangements will be provided, however, for non-government organisations that are non-taxpaying bodies which are subject to FBT at the moment. The Government does intend changing the various special rules that apply to such benefits as education of children of Australians employed overseas and foreign residents employed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not alter the methods of calculating FBT payable on cars. Neither will the Government reduce the existing concessions applying to particular benefits, such as remote area housing.

Legislation to achieve these objectives will be introduced following consultations with the Privacy Commissioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy builds on the unprecedented action this Government has taken over the past 10 years to close the net on tax evasion and avoidance. It will result in the collection of substantial revenue that would otherwise remain uncollected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of Australians are honest and pay their fair share of tax. The measures I am announcing today are directed at those few Australians who avoid or evade their tax liabilities. Those who choose to oppose these measures are choosing to allow those who are cheating on the tax system to continue to do so at the expense of honest taxpaying members of our community. The combination of help and enforcement strategies as outlined is designed to promote voluntary compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is designed to benefit the community rather than to impose additional burdens, I am mindful that the proposed enforcement strategy will involve some additional compliance costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a total deception and a total untruth, but still those opposite weakly slide back behind that sort of statement. The same happened on tariffs. The honourable member for Barker said last week about the Opposition's policies, `There is no difference between us and the Government'. So said the Leader of the Opposition. The same was said about road user charges, with the Opposition always slinking back to the defence, `We are just the same as the Government'. But, on the other hand, it says, `We are the brave new world'. Honourable members opposite are the brave new world when they are out there talking to Liberal Party conventions and those in the business community who want to listen to them, but in the public debate they are just the same as the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is going to introduce a goods and services tax, says the Deputy Leader without any basis for the claim. This only indicates how weak he is in not being able to defend the principal plank of his Fightback proposal. We have introduced legislation to pay a 30 per cent tax rate without a consumption tax. So the people of Australia should know that the tax rates legislated for today in this Parliament are all that they could expect from the coalition but with a consumption tax. The fact is that there is no need for a consumption tax to be introduced to pay for tax cuts because, as I demonstrated yesterday, $26 billion of the $27 billion is given back in other taxes: that is, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, $9 billion; the abolition of the payroll tax, $6 billion; the abolition of the petrol excise, $7 billion; and the compensation package for those hurt by the GST, $4 billion. One billion dollars will fund $13 billion worth of tax cuts. So the fact is that obviously the GST was not necessary to reduce the marginal rates of tax to 30 per cent at two-thirds of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Government itself has demonstrated, we did not need a consumption tax and do not need a consumption tax to pay lower rates of tax for those three-quarters of Australians whose last dollar of income will be within that marginal rate of 30 per cent. We have been able to give three-quarters of Australians a 30 per cent tax rate on their last dollar of income, without a consumption tax. So all the rest of the nasties&mdash;15 per cent on food, 15 per cent on clothing and 15 per cent on services to provide these tax cuts&mdash;were totally unnecessary. All we are going to do is basically have a huge tax shuffle which will see the WST, payroll tax and petrol excise abolished at massive disruption to the economy&mdash;with six to eight percentage points additional inflation, six to eight percentage points additional in interest rates&mdash;pushing the economy into a recession, along with the destruction of Medicare, along with a confrontationist industrial relations policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services.

What is the likely impact on health costs of alternative proposals to reduce the level of public hospital services?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. Members of the House will be aware that under Medicare the Government has succeeded in giving all Australians access to health care services&mdash;access to affordable Medicare&mdash;with over 70 per cent of medical services being provided at no cost to the patient. This has been achieved without a blow-out in the costs of hospital services, and total health spending has been maintained at around 8 per cent of GDP. This could have been achieved only with the Federal Government playing an important role in determining Medicare rebates, hospital funding and access to health services. As a result under Medicare 70 per cent of all GP services involve no out of pocket costs for the patient. More than three-quarters of all medical services are delivered at or below the medical benefits schedule and only 3 per cent of services are billed at or above the AMA schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Opposition appears to be unaware of the fact that the Government's approach to Medicare&mdash;the fact that we have been able to maintain a cap on costs&mdash;essentially means standing up to vested interests in favour of the public interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was simply drawing the attention of the House to the statement of the honourable member for Mackellar who said recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, our policy requires doctors to set their own fees as, fundamentally, the contract is between the patient and the doctor. The AMA will continue to recommend a schedule fee but the point we want to make is that this is nothing to do with the Government. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that we have been able to deliver health care to all Australians on a universal and equitable basis has everything to do with putting the public interest above vested interests and being prepared to ensure that there is observance of the medical benefits schedule; that there is a scheme that is reliable and which provides security into the future. Indeed, the role of the Government has been very much in providing that security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that, we have an Opposition which is determined one way or another to privatise the health system in Australia. It is determined one way or another to shift the responsibility from all Australians on to families. It would introduce policies that would result in subsidies to private insurance of about $2.5 billion at the expense of the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen just in the last few days the link between privatisation at the national level and what we see being pursued by the State coalition in New South Wales. Clearly what it has signalled this week is its intention to dismantle the public hospital system as an essential part of that agenda. We already know that it sees Port Macquarie as a launching pad for a wider scheme of privatisation of health. Major teaching hospitals such as Prince Henry and the Prince of Wales are also on the privatisation list, threatening the essential teaching functions of those hospitals. We already know also that the cost per bed, which is projected at Port Macquarie at $650, is far in excess of the average cost of $400 across Australia. Indeed, those hospital beds would be the most expensive beds anywhere in Australia. Of course, that will in turn lead not only to a blow-out in hospital costs but also to a shifting of those costs from the State to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioned on Radio 2BL yesterday, the New South Wales Health Minister admitted as much. He said, `There will be some cost shift for the Federal Government in terms of picking it up as well'. What Mr Phillips was saying is that the only way New South Wales can finance the profits of private operators running expensive private hospitals is by making sure that the Federal Government bears much of the cost. These points are important because the coalition is presenting a dangerous cocktail of privatisation, backed up by private insurance&mdash;exactly the same cocktail that has the United States health care system in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, we have the clearest possible division between the policies of the Government and those of the coalition. Our policies are stable, have maintained costs, have guaranteed quality health care and have ensured security for older people. Against that the policies of the coalition, linked at the State and Commonwealth level, would produce insecurity, shift costs onto families, and result in a massive blow-out of costs, leading to instability and a threat to the nation's health system right across this country.</PARA>

We're in the business of trying to advise our members exactly what the Fightback proposition will mean for individual farming enterprises. Now at the moment we can't be completely accurate until the coalition tells us the level of the road user charge.</PARA>
<PARA>The road user charge is between $3 1/2 and $4 billion. The registration fee could be as high as $17,000 on a six-axle truck or $35,000 on a very large truck. The first sign of grapeshot we saw was in the press statement from the shadow Minister which said that the Opposition does not have to introduce a charge. What we are seeing is the first unravelling of Dr Hewson, the first unravelling of the brave new world.

The whole Fightback policy, the brave new order, stands about two shots across the trench.

We are not going to slash the public sector in any of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of fact, in the Budget we introduced four new measures to facilitate trade. We extended the export market development grants scheme to eight years for new markets&mdash;unlike the Opposition, we do not attack that scheme at every opportunity. In terms of the export working capital facility that is to apply to EFIC, that will help our exporters in respect of finance. With respect to the aid agency, we have established a private sector linkages program; and in the portfolios of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce we have initiated a clean food export strategy. Unlike the Opposition, we have a multifaceted trade strategy. We do not get obsessed with single prongs, as does the honourable member for Kooyong. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation for Austrade in this year's Budget was $119.4m. That was an increase from $110.2m last year. There have been a lot of misinformed comments about Austrade. Austrade, in its post-McKinsey inquiry guise, has become a lot more rigorous. It has reorganised itself and it will be spending something like 63 per cent of its resources offshore this year. Next year, that will go up to 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only proposals that I know of to slash Austrade are by the Opposition. It promises in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document to cut $70m out of Austrade over two years and that would effectively halve its operating budget. The Opposition never stops attacking Austrade. The honourable member for Mayo will be delighted if I give him another run. On 26 March this year, in one of his usual expressive and outrageous press releases, he said that Austrade had a massive budget of $130m and that what had taken place in Austrade was absolutely scandalous. He said it was rort-ridden and that I have to rein the body in. He stated, `Once again, the Opposition's policy to change Austrade substantially has been vindicated'. All members of this House know how the honourable member for Mayo rabbits on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be changing. The day before yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said that there probably would be more resources for Austrade. Yesterday one of the papers said that resources might come from other parts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This is pretty twisted logic if you are going to hang on to that tatty policy document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. Or is this just more sliding around? Is it another U-turn? Is it more of the Opposition's, `We're just like them', when it comes under a bit of pressure? Is it a bit more of the shambles that we are seeing here? Is this too going to be added to the fiddles? Is this too going to be added to all the holes? Is this too going to be added to all the implicit dishonesty in that document? Has the honourable member for Kooyong been told he might get a bit more money for Austrade if he ever gets into government? Has the honourable member for Flinders been told that he might have to add a bit more to his GST if he ever gets into government? God help trade if he ever does.</PARA>

In very simple terms, it has income tax cuts of $8 billion to $9 billion. It has brought in a statement that it reckons will bring in a couple of billion dollars per annum and it is saying, `Now we can pay for the income tax cuts'. It is a load of baloney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me today I propose to expose the bankruptcy of the tax policy introduced today. I will very quickly respond to the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that whenever we are under a bit of pressure we have the same policy as the Government, and that this is an explanation for the fact that I have been alleging that Labor would introduce a GST after the next election. He is plain wrong to say that on that issue, on the basis of our claim, there is no difference between the parties. There is a very clear difference between the parties: we will say honestly what we are going to do and these people will lie and cheat to the next election to save their own political skins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people find it a bit incredible&mdash;as did one journalist interviewing me this morning&mdash;that we should allege that Labor would introduce a goods and services tax after the next election, they should not forget the Government's record. These are the people who said, `There will be no capital gains tax' and then introduced a capital gains tax. These are the people who supported and took political benefit out of advertisements in the last campaign which said that Labor would never privatise the Commonwealth Bank, and proceeded to do exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Prime Minister who said, `There will be no recession', when he and his senior economic Ministers knew that their policies would in fact see Australia fall into a recession. These are the people who in the last Budget only a month ago came into this Parliament after having concocted a story about taxes and said, `There might be some more taxes but then again there might not be. It won't be for many years that we will be able to tell you whether there will be or there won't be'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month later, simply because we have been hounding the Government, it has finally come up with part of its story as its blocker to the claim that this measure popped out this morning as a new additional tax. There is one last very clear reason why one would be mad to believe the Prime Minister today, who says that he is not going to introduce a GST. That is simply this:  in 1985 he was in favour of it and, if he had the opportunity, he would so introduce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry the Government will not give us more time to debate this issue, this most incredible statement brought down today by the Treasurer. On the question of the black economy we have an incredible turnaround, with Labor now claiming that we can spend $114m in the Taxation Office over three years and suddenly, hey-presto, abracadabra, $1,700m will come into the Federal Treasury, into revenue, as a result. What is even more extraordinary is that since Fightback came down Government members themselves have been saying that one cannot quantify the level of the black economy and therefore one cannot put a revenue estimate on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been in the Parliament day after day with a Treasury minute which confirms exactly that point. This minute, dated 16 December, which was part of the Government's attack on Fightback, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That interjection reveals that on Budget night when the Budget came down he was not ready to go. Here we have a massive turnaround: a figure which is in no way substantiated, which the Government got out of the Taxation Office only yesterday, and the Taxation Office minute which itself is contradictory. I would like an explanation from the Treasurer as to how it is that in one paragraph Mr Boucher, the Commissioner of Taxation, is saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, when addressing the question of a domestic withholding tax on interest I made the general point that it is a tenet of income tax administration that the most efficient and effective mains of gathering tax is to have it deducted at source.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, how is it that Mr Boucher said that?  What was in fact being advised to the Government earlier this year? After all these denials that it was looking at it, can the Government firstly give us an explanation as to what its intentions have been, particularly in light of the fact that we do not accept its `ironclad' guarantee that there will not be any extension later on? Secondly, how does one reconcile that statement with Mr Boucher going on to say virtually the opposite, which is, `I do not recommend such a change to the tax system'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point worth making is that not only do we now have this fictional figure that the Government has just plucked out of the air after months of saying that it is not possible to do so, but we also have a massive compliance cost being imposed on small business and individuals. The Government is talking about huge dollars. The hypocrisy of this is just staggering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been attacking us for abolishing seven taxes and introducing one new tax, but here it is about to employ an army of tax inspectors to get stuck into the small business community with the compliance measures, thereby justifying its claim. A lot of questions remain unanswered, but the most important question is the one that the Treasurer dodged in Question Time, `How can you possibly justify a major reform of the tax system and provide for 47 per cent of all Australian taxpayers no income tax relief whatsoever? How can you have the gall to stand here and claim compassion for lower income Australians when in fact you totally reject them?'. The Government put them into the recession. They are those most vulnerable to the recession that the Government caused; they are those most likely to be working part time because they have lost their full time job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a tax policy which completely abandons those people who in the past the Government has always claimed to be its own and for whom it has claimed a particular interest. This is a fraud, a denial of its own claims&mdash;the claims of a traditional Labor Party. The Government has turned its back on those lower income Australians most disadvantaged by its recession.

It is about politics, politics, politics&mdash;nothing else and nothing less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday morning people clambered out of their beds and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. They saw on the front page an article by Laura Tingle. There, exposed for all to see, was the politics of the tax games that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have been up to&mdash;the Prime Minister with his poisoned pen rewriting the Budget for political purposes, designed to deceive the Australian public between now and the next election. It was exposed by Laura Tingle in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. What happened? Were years and years of work put into designing a tax system brought into effect? Not at all! There was a 36-hour panic in the Australian Taxation Office, in the Treasurer's office and the Prime Minister's office to cobble together a few proposals and a few claims that somehow a new tax initiative would be produced to try to plug an enormous hole in the Government's budgetary projections, an enormous hole brought about by an earlier political decision&mdash;again not a decision based on an analysis of what should be done to help the country, but a decision designed solely to respond to the Fightback program, and nothing else. So we have the tax cuts announced in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government never thought about how to fund the tax cuts. It does not have a clue how to do it. This, cobbled together after the expose in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, is supposed to be one small step towards doing it, but does it do it? Does this plug the hole? The answer is that it does not. It still leaves a hole, according to the Government's own figures&mdash;and we can believe them if we want&mdash;of about $4 1/2 billion in 1995-96 in the Budget deficit or, if we take it on a cumulative basis over five years, the Government is left with something like a $50 billion hole in its cumulative deficit up until 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the fact is the Government is left with an enormous gap, a yawning chasm, in terms of its arithmetic. The Government is really playing games to try to deceive the Australian people to help it get through an election&mdash;an election it cannot win and will not win. This kind of fraudulent political behaviour will never deceive people in Australia; they will never fall for this kind of cheap politics, this sleight of hand, this repetition of 10 years of deceit, when the elections are upon us. That is all it is about. A fringe benefits tax extension is to raise another $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government has been arguing in this place since the launch of Fightback that there was no such thing as a black economy in Australia. Treasurer after Treasurer&mdash;there have been a fair few of them since the launch of Fightback&mdash;have stood at the despatch box and said, `We have fixed the black economy. That is all fixed. We had all these tax measures in years gone by, but they are fixed; don't worry; it is not there any more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was one of the rationales that used to be used by the present Prime Minister for abandoning the GST proposal that in his heart he so warmly favours and in practice, if he were unlikely enough to win the election, he would obviously go ahead and introduce. The fraudulence of it, as the Prime Minister would say, is so blatantly exposed. The Government does not believe there is a black economy but it is going to raise $1.7 billion from something that it does not even believe exists. Nobody, I am afraid, is going to vote for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the Government's saying that it will raise $600m out of a strategy for improving small business record keeping&mdash;well, my oh my! Who would believe that? Who will believe those opposite any more? It is a totally fraudulent game of politics that they play the whole time. They never do anything serious for the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a broadcast day so the folk in the gallery here are the only witnesses to what is a genuine parliamentary tantrum. What we see here from members of the Opposition is a genuine parliamentary tantrum. As Alfred Deakin once described Billy Hughes, they have been dragged kicking and screaming from the tart shop, because they see whisked away from underneath them what they believed would be a capacity on their part to demonise, to lie, to deceive, about the potentiality of the propositions put by the Government in the Budget to raise some extra taxes. In their view, that was partial evidence for them to be able to argue in public that this Government would be as stupid as they would be in seeking to impose upon the ordinary people of this country the most heinous massive tax burden coming out of a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tip-off in the speeches made by the Opposition spokesmen in this debate was not all that they had to say about whether or not they had answers on the propositions contained in the Bills that have been introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The tip-off was not all the persiflage around that. The tip-off was what they had to say when they said, `Well, look, really the Government intends to introduce a goods and services tax. Please believe that the Government will introduce a goods and services tax. The Government must introduce a goods and services tax. It must have it in the back of its mind that it is going to introduce a goods and services tax because, if you do not believe that, of course, by implication, you would be absolute card-carrying lunatics to vote for us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly the proposition with which members of the Opposition go to the electorate. But, having had this element of what they considered evidence&mdash;a totally spurious piece of evidence, but they have been wandering around touting it&mdash;ripped out from under them, what do they fall back on? They fall back to an argument about something back in 1985. Since then there have been a couple of elections, about eight or nine Budgets and no appearance or a whiff of a goods and services tax. But they say, `Well, back in 1985 the Government said something favourable about it when it lost hope that it would be able to get back to repair the base of the taxation system through fringe benefits tax and through the introduction of means testing in the welfare area and it thought that it might be able to make up that hole with a goods and services tax'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, I am afraid that that will not wash. Eight Budgets and two elections since that point in time are not enough evidence; nor was what those opposite thought they had before enough evidence. But, like any drowning people, they will cling on to whatever lifebelt floats past. Well, one of the lifebelts has just floated past forever as far as they are concerned, and they are left more and more exposed with the propositions that they have put forward on the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will nail one other little lie which is peddled around this place by Opposition members from time to time when they put forward the point of view that the Government acts in a manner that deceives the electorate. I will go to the capital gains tax, because I think it is terribly important. I will talk about one or two other secret taxes on the part of the Opposition. It is true that in the 1983 election campaign Mr Hawke went to the public and said, `We will not introduce a capital gains tax'. Then in 1984 there was another election. In the course of that election campaign, Mr Hawke was asked the specific question, `Will you introduce a capital gains tax?', and he said, `I will give you no undertaking on that in this election; I will give you none. We are going to have a tax summit. We are going to consider the introduction of a range of measures, and among them will be a capital gains tax'. This is the myth that the Liberal Party has lived with ever since, and is yet another piece of nonsense that Opposition members want to run around with and say, `Please believe that the Government is going to introduce a goods and services tax'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members forget the little inconvenience of the initial election in 1983 and the subsequent introduction of a capital gains tax. Mr Hawke made it absolutely clear to the Australian electorate in 1984 that he would indeed contemplate a capital gains tax and took whatever political damage there was to take on that issue when it was subsequently demonised by members of the Opposition. They have taken a long time to come around to the view that people who get their earnings in capitalist gains, as opposed to simply getting their earnings through being PAYE taxpayers, ought to be equally treated. It has been a very long time before they have been able to get round to accepting that. They have been cheerful enough about demonising us in the electorate on capital gains tax in that intervening period. But there ain't no evidence in that example either!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are desperate to try to prove that, somehow or other, the Government is going to introduce a goods and services tax so that the horror of finally having to go to the Australian electorate to explain to the small businessmen in this community the massive impact that compliance with a goods and services tax will impose on them is obviated. Then they must explain to the poor people and to middle income people in this community the massive impact that a 15 per cent tax will have on all their necessities of life and on their capacity to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also have to go to that electorate and explain one or two other little secret taxes of their own that they will have to think about. I will name two. One of them is road user charges. Opposition members tumbled horribly on that, and they are twisting slowly on that spit. Quite rightly, the National Farmers Federation has said to them, `As much as we like a goods and services tax, if we have to cop something on that to fill a $4 billion gap, then we are well and truly dead. Therefore, we want to get a few assurances on that', and assurances they cannot get because there are $4 billion worth of assurances that cannot be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second secret tax that Opposition members will not discuss, but which must be dealt with by this Parliament, by the general public and by the media in political debate, is the payroll tax substitute. They have failed to explain how they will take this tax off the States and compensate them. Will they give the money back on the basis of what they collect now, so that they reward the profligate, or will they give the money back so that those who charge huge payroll taxes get rewarded for it? Is that the basis on which it will be distributed back to them? If it is not given back to them on the basis of the profligate, how much will they cut off those States which are regarded as profligate, and what effect will that have on that service? What will they do with the States when they inform them that they are to remove 30 per cent of the States' tax base and tie it to the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable members what they will do with the States, because they have already said that they would do this in a most unguarded moment. They would give them a guaranteed proportion of income tax or a guaranteed proportion of the goods and services tax which they can subsequently choose to manipulate up or down as they see fit. That is another massive secret tax that is waiting out there in the public domain to come back and whack the Opposition over the back of the head by the time the next election comes round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can bet their bottom dollar that the States will not allow them to remove unfettered 30 per cent of their tax raising powers and the flexibility they have to manipulate that up or down according to their States' economic needs without giving them a similar capacity to determine particular levels of income tax at any time. That is the second secret tax those opposite will have to explain. They will have to explain their road user secret tax and their payroll substitute secret income or additional GST tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, when it all boils down, when we look at the impact of all these propositions from the other side on the ordinary people of this country, it makes laughable the crocodile tears they allegedly cry on behalf of those people in regard to any propositions the Government is putting forward. In the final analysis, whatever difficulty 15 per cent causes small business, it is nothing compared with what it will cause the ordinary people in this country as they are economically destroyed by a piece of pure political lunacy&mdash;imposing a 15 per cent consumption tax on an economy in recovery, imposing a tax that increases the inflation rate and imposing a tax that will create industrial trouble.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two weeks ago, President Bush announced a dramatic increase in the export enhancement program subsidies on US farm products&mdash;an increase from $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion for the next year. For wheat, that meant an increase from $US900m in the year just ending to a minimum of $US1.4 billion this year. That announcement sent shock waves through the wheat industry in Australia and through anybody in Australia who has a concern about our trade balance. Wheat growers remembered those terrible wheat war years of 1986 and 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement by President Bush indicated that there was a new system of EEP: that all of the export wheat from the United States was available for EEP markets and it listed the tonnages and the countries. Those countries included two new ones&mdash;Pakistan and South Africa&mdash;which have been traditional markets for Australian wheat, and once again included India, which is now a market for Australian wheat. It indicated also that more money was available if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia and Australian wheat growers, that immediately meant that the price of wheat would drop. The simple fact of that announcement meant that the wheat market weakened immediately. It also meant that the market share for Australia's wheat internationally was being further and further restricted because the United States had indicated the tonnages available to Australian wheat exports for the future&mdash;or those tonnages available without competition with the United States and its subsidised exports. It means that, from a country that was producing 15 million tonnes of wheat for export, Australia is being forced back to producing only 10 million tonnes of wheat for export, with all that that means for wheat growers' incomes and Australia's balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It revealed what a useless arrangement this Government has in place with the United States and President Bush, and what terrible political and market intelligence we have in Washington. Instead of the first information about this announcement coming through to Australia and the Australian Government from the White House to our embassy in Washington, as it should have done, or from the US embassy here to this Government, it came from a private tip-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement indicated that the US considered that it was under no pressure whatsoever from this Australian Government. It highlighted the complete failure of this Government and its wheat policy. It also highlighted the correctness of the coalition Opposition to be stronger in relation to the need to maintain pressure on the United States, to seek access for Australian products to the United States and other restricted markets, and to have a stronger bilateral presence in seeking alternative markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement also revealed the extent of the US trade war against Australia. What was the response of the Government to President Bush's announcement? It basically bought the United States line: `Don't react. Nothing may happen. No need to worry immediately. What we need is quiet diplomacy&mdash;softly, softly. Don't upset anybody'. The best&mdash;or worst&mdash;example of that softly, softly approach was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in Washington two months before. On the advice given to me, he went so softly, softly that the matter was not even raised in the United States. Certainly in the areas of fruit and dairy products, there was no representation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the reaction of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? It took him six days after the first announcement of President Bush's new policy initiative with EEP to formally reply. Compare that to the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who immediately wrote a letter to the President. The charge d'affaires was not called in while the US Ambassador was absent. There is no evidence that the US Ambassador has been called in here. There is no evidence of any official protest in the United States. All this Government did was bring on a matter of public importance debate in this House about a week ago, still trying to justify its failed softly, softly approach. For a day or two it even conned some of the media and a few people in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened? The Pakistan wheat sale. No-one should be surprised that that sale has occurred, because the new system that has been put in place for EEP is the opposite of the line that this Government has been pushing. It has opened up the whole EEP market, the whole export tonnage of the United States, to grain traders from day one. Those grain traders have not been slow to get into action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There still has been no significant response from the Australian Government. There was no decent intelligence that told the Australian Government that this Pakistan sale was about to occur. If anybody wants any confirmation of the feelings the United States has about this Government and its lack of reaction, it is that at the very time that that announcement of the wheat sale to Pakistan is made, and also of the second and third sales of canned fruit to Japan under the same program, the chief EEP operator for the United States is in this country and will be in this Parliament House in about an hour's time. So much for the sensitivity of the United States to what has to be done with regard to this Government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing, and I think the most significant thing, is that the Pakistan sale delivers all the worst signals possible for the Australian wheat industry. Firstly, it is a new market that has not been in EEP before. It is a traditional commercial market for Australia; it has always been a commercial market in the past. There is no European Community wheat of that type going to Pakistan. It is a white wheat market. The US claims that it has heard some rumours that something may be happening, but it is well known that the EC does not have that type of wheat. It is an unnecessarily large subsidy. That subsidy has effectively reduced the world price for wheat by 20 to 25 per cent, with all the implications that means for our wheat growers. Remember, at this stage the United States has its lowest wheat stocks on record and does not have an over-large harvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end. Next week there is a tender to be determined from Pakistan for twice the tonnage&mdash;over 400,000 tonnes. The United States is the only one that can respond to that tender. What action has this Government taken with the United States to get some sense back into the market to create a more commercial price? What about Egypt, also out there bidding at present, which is one of our markets too? Let us see what the Government is doing. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`It's our view that this matter needs to be taken further&mdash;needs to be taken to a political level where the assurances were given.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said the Government would be seeking to make sure Mr Bush honoured his recent commitment to Australia that it would not be directly targeted.</PARA>
<PARA>Everything is in future tense. The Government has not taken one positive, purposeful, high level protest or action in relation to what has taken place and what is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also exposed the wider implications of the US trade relationship with Australia. It highlights the sense and purpose of and necessity for the statements being made by the coalition Leader, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable</PARA>
<PARA>member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), me and others on the problems of restricted access to the United States and to other markets. They restrict us and then go out with their subsidies and knock us out of other markets. There is no point the Prime Minister saying in relation to the US, as he said in the debate on access to Japan, `After all, we have a trade surplus with that country'. We do not have a trade surplus with the United States; it has a very good trade surplus with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the European Community, the United States is the main sinner with regard to domestic production subsidies for a whole range of agricultural products and export subsidies that are necessary to flog the stuff overseas. The third point concerns restrictions to access for our products&mdash;those same products&mdash;to its market. Japan has as many or more domestic production subsidies and restrictions to access for our agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States actually has a whole range of domestic agricultural policies which are similar to those of the European Community. In recent months our farmers and exporters have seen the fury of US export subsidies, with canned fruit being included in that export program for the first time. Now the third sale has taken place to Japan at a time when the United States is already increasing its market share in that market, a market in which canned fruit and a range of horticultural products attract not only EEP assistance but also another subsidy program called the MPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US also has a dairy export program. So far this calendar year it has built that up to $70m. It has taken market away from us in Saudi Arabia, while at the same time Australia is virtually denied access to the United States market for our dairy products. We have a small quota on cheese, and every other product is basically excluded. It even had a dumping measure against canned pears brought in in 1972, and it has never been removed because there is no opportunity under its laws for industry to have it removed and because of lack of pressure from this Government to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the restrictions the US placed on Australia's access to the beef and meat market half way through this year and the havoc that has created in our industry. Perhaps the worst example of the lot is sugar. The US is gradually restricting access year by year, down from 800,000 tonnes to 96,000 tonnes. The Government took it to the GATT a couple of years ago and won the case. Nothing has happened in the United States since then, and this Government has not maintained pressure on it to do anything. That says a lot for how sensible and useful taking the wheat problem to the GATT will be. Only three weeks ago the US further restricted our sugar access. All the Government could do was bring in the Mexican furphy on sugar, put up by its own front organisation, the Evatt Foundation. Even the Minister, when he found out the facts, had to admit that Mexico is an importer of sugar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Prime Minister's reaction to no restrictions on access to Japan? I have a document which has three pages of restrictions by Japan on agricultural products alone from Australia&mdash;over 50 different situations in which it either has an embargo, such as on rice, or a virtual embargo, such as on fresh milk or UHT milk, right through to quotas and quarantine restrictions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including tariff quotas. One can go on and on about the Japanese restrictions. Here is a beauty. It has been said that there is no barrier to fresh milk&mdash;but it cannot be accepted if it has been pasteurised or heat treated. That, effectively, rules out any fresh milk. Butter or skim milk powder can be sold in Japan only when there is a shortage and when that great organisation, the LIPC, determines at what price and under what arrangements it will come in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all these problems confronting our agricultural exports, of which the worst is EEP and wheat. But all these problems go far beyond that. There is still no urgency from this Government and still no determination in its mind to do anything significant. The Prime Minister is going to Japan next week. In his discussions there, as a minimum he must raise all of those restrictions that are placed on our exports to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the United States, there is still $US500m available in the EEP kitty to be distributed. The way President Bush is going at present, it will be distributed. What pressure is this Government putting on the US Administration to stop a further widening of the EEP into more and more Australian products?  What is this Government doing with regard to getting a more sensible price arrangement with the United States on that Pakistan tender for next week? This Government gives no hope to our wheat growers and to our agricultural exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as the alternative government, do give hope with our Fightback to reduce costs; and with our greater pressure on access and alternative markets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last two weeks have convinced me of absolutely one thing: heaven help Australia if the Opposition were ever to get into government and put into place all the contradictory, naive, stupid things those opposite have been saying on trade and exports. Their trade policy is a combination of hiss, wind and back to traditional Country Party abuse. I suppose the poor old Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), thought he had to come in here and say these things. I thought he was quite right on the analysis of the US position when he said, `We have to do something. There is a lack of pressure and we have to take these things up'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we come up against every time we seriously debate this whole question. World trade is distorted. It was the United States that kept agriculture out of the GATT, with the GATT waiver exercised in 1954. It is Australia and the present US Administration that have forced agriculture into the GATT Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of this started when the US packaged its EEP in one year, in an election context, rather than announcing initiative after initiative. A lot of this debate is taking place because the National Party is mightily embarrassed, with the Queensland State election coming up, about zero tariffs for sugar. The matter of public importance today reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing failure of the Australian Government to promote and protect Australia's trade.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not say anything about wheat, although wheat is part of our trade. But all we got from the honourable member for Murray was a tirade about wheat and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite happy to take on this question of Australia's trade promotion and protection. The Opposition, quite frankly, still has not been able to divine what has changed in the world; what international forces are now at work; and what the US policies and strategies have been and now are. It has not been able to work out what the EC's policies and strategies are and may be, and what the realities of the interests of trading areas are. From all of this it does not understand what Australia's interests and strategies should be at this time. There is a harking back to the past and, as I said, more of the old Country Party approach of abusing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Calling the United States our No. 1 trade enemy is okay for a National Party conference, but those opposite really cannot do that if the next day they say that they want to join an unspecified North American Free Trade Arrangement; the next day they admit that they do not know how they would do it; or claim that a naive letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has somehow immediately changed Republican Party trade policy, as if the Opposition can write campaign speeches. It is totally hypocritical for the Opposition to raise this matter of public importance after it has fundamentally done so much damage to our relations with our major trading partners and allies by saying, `US&mdash;No. 1 enemy', by making false claims about President Bush's reasons for action and by sending off a rude letter. If that works then those opposite should write a letter every day. Maybe they should have written another letter today. The US announced an EEP yesterday on wheat to Pakistan and there is another one today. I think those opposite ought to write a letter a day if they think that is going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to Japan, the matter today is really aimed at protecting the decaying National Party in Queensland. But in the process all the Opposition did was to offend our biggest trading partner with whom we have a $6 billion surplus. A $6 billion surplus does not mean that we ease up. I just spent a week in Japan, even to the extent of talking to LDP members on the island of Kyushu about rice, about coal and about our products. The pressure from Australia never stops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd to talk about rice with Japan in a bilateral context. Only the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can control the US congressional system, US politics and, at the same time, the Japanese political system. Even if the LDP were able to get arrangements to purchase rice bilaterally from Australia through its lower House, its upper House could not resist the temptation to block it. It is nonsense to think we can do anything about rice, in the bilateral context, with Japan. As I pointed out the other day, with a $45 billion trade deficit and with the United States providing the defence umbrella and massive leverage, the United States can do nothing bilaterally on rice. But the Leader of the Opposition, who has just discovered this issue and all the restrictions that apply from Japan, somehow thinks that, if he talks about it and makes us feel warm inside, it will solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had another mission impossible suggested by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) with respect to Northwest Airlines when the capacity for retaliation by the Americans would have been enormous. Of course, the Leader of the National Party is going to cross that bridge when he comes to it. It is also absurd that the Opposition raises this issue when it has no policy in this area and when our trade performance is a success story that all Australians can share in and be proud of. My colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) will outline this success to the House when he speaks on this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the National Party spoke mainly about the United States, EEP and wheat and did not address the matter of public importance as such. Everything that the Republican Administration has said through the Reagan years and now under President Bush in principle has been about trade liberalisation. The US practice and tactics in a distorted trade world are at odds with the US Administration's stated principles. Perhaps we can understand what was in President Bush's Detroit speech if we accept that fundamental fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Opposition to talk about trade blocs, about Australia being left out if we do not join the North American Free Trade Arrangement, the EC, or the Arctic Circle trade agreement is ignorant, malicious scaremongering and nothing else. The Government's position on the recent EEP announcements is well known. I will be stressing our disagreement with the US analysis of the Pakistan market when I am there next week, especially regarding the level of subsidy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and I talked with the US Ambassador last night, we were briefed by Stephen Censky, and there is simply no way that we did not hammer those points forward. I will be hammering those points forward with Secretary of Agriculture Madigan and trade representative Carla Hills in Washington next Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as we are in a power based system and do not have a rules based system for world trade we will suffer at the sidelines of the trade war between the two huge subsidisers of agricultural production in the world today: the United States and the EC. The Opposition has no answers; it is just bluster aimed at Queensland voters in the State election this weekend. If those opposite were allowed to act as a government the way they act as an Opposition, the Americans would not be coming here for talks on trade the way they are; they would be hurting our farmers and our steel makers even more. The US interests do not hesitate to act out their interests; nor does Australia hesitate to act out our interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On all this the Opposition is a joke. It is 100 per cent humbug and it is 100 per cent sham. More importantly, the Opposition is dangerous to our trade and economic interests. The Leader of the Opposition attacked Japan in response to US action and that is what was nonsensical about it. It was unprecedented for the US and the Japanese embassies to come out and say, `The Leader of the Opposition is plain wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, for the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) to claim that the speech of President Bush in Detroit last week was as a result of the Leader of the Opposition's letter was also shown to be plainly wrong. There is not a sensible, informed commentator in this country who has agreed with a word of what the Opposition has been saying on trade policy over the last two weeks. Today, in a question at Question Time, I picked up the point again in Fightback that the Opposition is going to slash Austrade; it is going to slash aid&mdash;and aid is commercially directed in part these days, and that is very important; and it is going to go for zero tariffs and wreck the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is also unprecedented: there is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today headed `How the Liberals would kill our billion dollar car industry'. That industry is now worth $1.2 billion a year in exports, so where is the Opposition's trade and export strategy? It is going to kill it. It is an industry worth $8 billion all up. We do not know how much is going to be left, but there will be a big import bill as well. Is the Opposition going to import cars all second-hand from Japan? Luxury cars will get a bit of relief from the GST. I suppose that is a good thing for Liberal voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolute nonsense to talk of all these things on trade when the Opposition has policies which will wreck our bilateral trade instrument, Austrade, which will persecute Australian exporters, and which will really wreck one of our major manufacturing industries. Today the Leader of the Opposition said that he might put more resources into trade. The National Party does not know what to say, whether Austrade should be wiped out or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One big point is always missed in this debate: governments can only facilitate trade. It is not just simply having a trade policy that facilitates trade and exports. Economic policy, industry policy, and industrial relations policy are all just as important. Governments export very little. But trade can be facilitated, and simply thinking that trade approach is based on only one area of government policy is a complete nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition then said that we should join the North American Free Trade Agreement. Again, not one responsible trade commentator anywhere has supported the Opposition in this. NAFTA, from what we do know about it, is about concessions. It is not really a free trade zone like the EC, but a series of separate bilateral relationships between each of the three, especially with respect to agriculture. So what have we got to offer? The US has access to our markets now. How can the Opposition negotiate and how can it bargain if it has got a policy of zero tariffs? It has nothing to bargain with unless agriculture is in it. The way the Opposition is carrying on is simply nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAFTA looks more and more as if the United States is going to act as a hub and take countries one at a time. Why do honourable members think that in his speech in Detroit President Bush is saying that he wants to get central Europe into some free trade arrangement&mdash;the same countries that applied to join the EC? What is he saying about the Pacific? That is directed towards Japan, just as talking about central Europe is directed towards Europe; it is putting pressure on in the multilateral context. There are all kinds of strategies and tactics implicit in those statements of President Bush's vision for his next term if he is elected. NAFTA has nothing for Australia compared with the Asia-Pacific trading area; it has nothing for us compared with regional trade liberalisation, bilateral trade liberalisation, all hopefully under the umbrella of multilateral trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why multilateral? The real world of trade today is non-tariff barriers; it is some of the barriers that the honourable member for Murray pointed to in Japan. If one gets those, in the terms of the jargon, `comprehensively tariffed'&mdash;all measures of protection and restriction expressed as a tariff&mdash;and one gets a multilateral solution, then in one fell swoop one will wipe out all those thousands of non-tariff barriers. If one gets a multilateral solution in the Uruguay Round, and if one looks at the Dunkel text and takes into account the access arrangements, Australia gets access to markets of all the GATT contracting parties&mdash;some 103 to 108 countries&mdash;and again we can prosecute bilateral trade far more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history. Quite apart from the fact that agriculture has never been in multilateral trade negotiations before, at other times we always found we had very little to offer, and we had nothing to buy any concessions with. When Doug Anthony went to the last round of trade negotiations he came back saying that he did not have to cut a single tariff in Australia. That is because of the situation where we had the strong orientation of all our exports to agriculture and natural resource based products, world markets where commodity prices fluctuate, and we really had nothing to bargain with unless agriculture was in the round. So that is why this Government formed the Cairns Group; that is why this Government formed APEC. The idea behind APEC was to get regional trade liberalisation, and to have a forum where economic and trade matters could be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no lack of pressure on any front with respect to our trade approach. Now there is the invitation for the Prime Minister to raise these matters in Japan. Of course he will; he always does. The honourable member for Kooyong says that we have only got a single pronged trade strategy&mdash;some would say that the honourable member for Kooyong has a single pronged approach to many things in politics&mdash;but I do not share those views. Let me quickly identify the prongs&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;of our trade policy. Multilaterally it is via the Cairns Group; regionally, it is APEC, and there are sub-regional approaches; bilaterally it is country to country&mdash;whether it is Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Kuwait or New Zealand. Of course there are sectoral trade policies, and we are prosecuting these multifaceted approaches in all of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Austrade, the main facilitating body with respect to bilateral trade. This is the organisation that members of the Opposition are virtually going to wipe out, although I understand that now their Leader is having second thoughts about that. We have the national trade strategy between the Australian Government and the State and Territory governments, and the results are there, as my colleague will explain.

<PARA>It is one of the ironies that, in this chamber in Question Time, the premium debating chamber in the land, when there is no debate we are swamped by public support from the public galleries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Day in and day out he comes and delivers a tirade of abuse at the Opposition. It is as if the thespian in him comes to life: lights, cameras, sound, action! The Prime Minister, be-suited, fits the role he has been set to play. But take him out of here, to the point at which the real decisions have to be made and the real negotiations have to take place&mdash;take him, for example, to the National Press Club&mdash;and Australia has to face the reality that the man who leads the Government is nothing more than an actor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate on Australia's trade performance, the Opposition wants to focus on how little has been achieved by the Government in trade and on how much, as a result of the sound and fury and emptiness of the Prime Minister and his Government, we now have a burden being carried by every Australian exporter and, particularly, by Australia's wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I have to tell honourable members that the Prime Minister reminds me of a formula one car revving up in the pits, making all the noises but never getting over the finishing line. On the world stage in trade terms he is seen as nothing more than an empty vessel. What did the Prime Minister say to Laurie Oakes in an interview conducted in October 1991 when he was a pretender to the role of Prime Minister? He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and wouldn't be, where I spring to attention the moment an American President picks up the phone. I think Australia's got the right to the dignity of an independent view and I've taken a glove to the Americans when it suited me.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Mr Prime Minister, this MPI is all about asking the question: why does it not suit you now? Let us see the Government perform on the issue of tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and world trade. Australian farmers are being adversely affected by the inaction of the Australian Labor Party, the inaction of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) and the velvet glove of the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we seen? We have seen the American President, Mr Bush, in an action of blatant political pragmatism, promise to his farmers at a meeting in South Dakota, simply to buy their votes, that he would offer them the support they needed&mdash;and the Prime Minister snapped to attention in his thespian role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Australian farmers seek from the Government are not the sorts of excuses that we have had delivered from the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development in the 10-minute tirade that he delivered in the Parliament, but instead some indication that outside of the theatre of this place they can depend on the Prime Minister, the Minister and the Government to recognise the real demands that farmers have and to recognise that the play is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic case of the inactivity of the Government particularly, and of the Minister, was the inaction that followed the announcement yesterday morning of the decision of the Americans effectively to send 220,000 tonnes of subsidised grain into a characteristically Australian market, the Pakistan market. There is no way that this action can take place without effectively paralysing Australia's wheat farmers. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party has said, as if that were not enough, as I have discovered in my conversations with Australian Wheat Board personnel, there is another proposal. That proposal is next week to provide the opportunity for a further 420,000 tonnes of American subsidised grain to be dropped into what is a characteristically Australian market, Pakistan. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development come in here and say? Far from offering us any solution, he chose to be critical of what the Opposition has done and to suggest that the Government's trade performance has been up to speed. Do I have to read again the words&mdash;irrefutable&mdash;of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), delivered earlier this week, about the Government's real trade performance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we discover if we look at the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asia-Pacific Profiles</EMPHASIS>? We discover that in the Hong Kong market China has gone from 20 per cent to 36 per cent but Australia has gone from 2 per cent to one per cent. `What sort of trade performance is that', I ask the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). In the Japanese market, the United States has gone from 17 per cent to 23 per cent; the European Community from 6 to 16 per cent&mdash;and Australia has stayed at 5 per cent. What sort of trade performance is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not here inventing easy solutions. There is reel after reel of illustrations of how we as a nation have marked time in trade performance. We are not here in opposition suggesting that there is a simple way round. But we are saying that in the light of what has happened, particularly in the last two weeks: why are we not protesting loudly to the Americans and demanding some sort of bilateral trade negotiations so that we can get additional access to the American market to compensate us for what the Americans are doing to us in what have been our traditional markets, contrary to the pledge given by their President in this chamber on 2 January of this year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did we go in this debate? We finished up with the Minister not dealing specifically with the agricultural trade question but instead dragging in the red herring of tariffs and suggesting that all that motivated us was the Queensland election. I have never heard such a blatantly two-faced approach from the Minister. If we wanted to be pragmatists, would we be backing the Government on its tariff line with sugar in Queensland right now? Of course we would not. Far from taking a cheap shot to win the Queensland election, we have taken the responsible view that effectively we have to maintain our present tariff regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we challenge the Government and say to it, `What are you doing for Australian wheat growers?'. The answer, sadly, is nothing. The obligation that the Minister has, representing Australian wheat growers, is to be in America now negotiating a new bilateral deal on behalf of not only wheat growers but also beef growers, horticultural producers and sugar growers in order to get some compensation for Australia's primary producers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for the contributions that they have made this afternoon because, if nothing else, what they did was to highlight, as the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) rightly pointed out, just the harking back to the future sort of approach to trade policy that those on the other side have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to break it to both gentlemen, and particularly to those in the National Party of Australia, but the fact is that Australia's trade has now moved on from simply primary products to other areas. Primary products are important; there is no question about that. They are a vital part of Australia's trade performance and, as the Minister clearly pointed out, at every opportunity this Government has been pursuing, through appropriate forums, ways in which to improve that performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister also demonstrated, the leading role that Australia has played in the Cairns Group&mdash;with the Uruguay Round being driven, particularly in agriculture, by Australia and the other participants of the Cairns Group&mdash;demonstrates this Government's bona fides and concern for these issues. Interestingly, if one looks at some of the statistics&mdash;the honourable member for Wakefield talked of some of those statistics supposedly put around by the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)&mdash;they show some very interesting real world scenarios and pictures of what is happening as far as Australia's trade is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal briefly with a couple of those statistics. As far as Australia's export performance is concerned, export revenues have actually reached record levels in the life of this Government, despite depressed commodity prices and subdued world economic activity. Export volumes rose by 12 per cent in 1990-91 and by over 9 per cent in 1991-92. Our export volume growth in 1991 was the fastest in the OECD and our manufactures export growth was the fastest in the OECD in both 1990 and 1991. Finally, our export volumes grew almost three times faster than world trade in 1990 and four times faster in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did that happen? Is it because the Government has not got a trade policy? Is it because we have turned our back on Australian producers and exporters, as was claimed by those on the other side in this debate? That is absolute rubbish. If one looks at where that performance has come from, the direction of our exports, our trade surplus and so on, one can see clearly that there has been a change in emphasis. The story is exciting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than sitting back and knocking all the time, as those opposite would do, they should be out there talking up Australia's trade performance. They should be talking about AOTC and what it is doing in Cambodia. They should be talking about AWA and what it has done in getting $20m worth of navigation deals in China. They should be out there talking about Ford Australia securing its first export program for Japan with a $30m contract to supply Mazda with 280,000 cylinder blocks as part of a wider program of parts replacement. They should be out there talking about the fact that our growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures almost doubled between 1986-87 and 1991-92 from something like $4.97 billion to $9.66 billion. Are those the sorts of figures of a government, a manufacturing sector and an export oriented economy&mdash;which Australia is&mdash;that demonstrate that there is no policy and that we are going backwards? I hardly think so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when we look at those aspects of our improved trade performance, we also have to give consideration to, quite simply, where some additional growth will come. That, of course, is in the services sector. Two weeks ago I, along with the Minister, was in Japan promoting Australia's trade&mdash;I in services and he particularly in agriculture and other matters. The interesting thing was that we were there also to open up the latest in one of Austrade's new offices in Japan to promote Australian trade. We went to another city called Sendai, where we will establish yet another Austrade office. We were talking to Japanese people about buying more Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of a week later, we had an unmitigated and unbelievable attack on Japan, our major trading partner, from the Opposition. Quite frankly, it is probably just as well that both the Minister and I had left Japan by then, because it would have been rather embarrassing to have to explain to people why we were establishing trade offices in their country, why we were there talking about how we were going to continue, particularly in the area of services, to promote trade from Australia, when at the same time they would be asking, `Why it is that there are people in your country, and a party that wants to be in government, that are attacking your main customer?'. As I said, fortunately we had left and we did not have to face those sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quickly deal with a couple of issues in the area of services. Education services from Australia are now worth $1 billion a year&mdash;that is, university, high school and a rapidly expanding market in vocational training. We talked to people in Japan about that. They said to us quite clearly, `Your education standards are superb. We would like to see more of our people go to Australia and train, particularly in postgraduate degrees, but importantly in English language training combined with secretarial skills'. I have taken that on board, and I will be talking to people in the TAFE systems at the State level and to people in DEET and other agencies in Australia to try to promote that in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I followed that visit with one to Thailand. Exactly the same sorts of issues were raised with me. In fact, four of the outgoing Cabinet Ministers in Thailand were educated in Australia. They are out there working and promoting Australia for its educational opportunities&mdash;contributing to the $1 billion-plus per annum that Australia earns from education. Yet we have been told by the Opposition that all we should be concerned about is some statement that President Bush made on the stump in an election campaign about wheat. It smacks like the old days when the National Party was in government and it made announcements on the run in an election campaign. As far as this Government is concerned, we have diversified. We are internationalising our economy and our ability to trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where there are some benefits that can flow to Australia in our trade performance&mdash;away from the ETMs that I have mentioned, away from education and away from agriculture&mdash;is that of services such as financial services, insurance and health care. The interesting thing is that the statistics indicate that a Japanese, for example, could come to Australia, pay for an operation in this country and therefore contribute considerable sums of money to this area, holiday in this country to recuperate and again put money in almost as a tourist, and it would be cheaper than going to the United States. That is a market that again we can tap into, and something that we should be promoting. It is an untapped resource that at the moment is only on the periphery of our interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In insurance, for example, the market potential in Thailand, Japan and other parts of Asia is unlimited. We are starting to see the companies that are presently there going more to Western style economies with home ownership and so on. The opportunities for Australian insurance companies to go there and work, perhaps in joint ventures, to promote opportunities in exporting of services are absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is part of this Government's trade strategy. We have an East Asia Analytical Unit as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It has brought down two reports so far&mdash;one by Ross Garnaut and one by Geoff Raby&mdash;which have looked at the opportunities in that part of the world. At the moment we are doing a study on South East Asia whereby we will actually have something of an outline, a road map, if you like, on strategies and how to get into those markets. We have talked about training opportunities, the need to get fluent in foreign languages, particularly in those areas to which we want to go, the importance of establishing an office in those locations to promote Australian trade, and the need to get into joint venture operations as well. All of this is part of the Government's trade strategy, because times have moved on. We have moved on from one-off deals. We have negotiated bilateral and multilateral trade deals. Again referring to some of the statistics on this, from the information that has been given to me, bilateral trade economic agreements have been negotiated with 32 countries in recent years by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not sitting on our hands. This MPI today was supposedly about the failure of this Government to do anything about promoting Australia's trade policy. It is not simply about wheat and what was happening in those particular two deals because of an American election campaign; it is wider than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the coalition woke up to itself and, in embracing a trade strategy and a trade policy, clearly looked at all issues associated with this. Those opposite should be joining with the Government and singing the praises of major companies who are prepared to get out there and negotiate. They should be singing the praises of Austrade, which is moving 70 per cent of its resources offshore to promote Australian trade, instead of carping in the way they are. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I have great pleasure in introducing this Bill to the House. My particular pleasure derives from the fact that this Bill provides for further measures to assist frail older people in our community, and particularly their carers. It is appropriate that this Bill should be introduced today because this week has been designated Carers Week. This is a week when we are focusing particularly on the needs of people who care for family members, friends, neighbours or other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's aged care policy pays particular attention to the needs of carers. The home and community care program lists carers as a special target group for the program. Our residential care program makes special provision for respite care to enable carers to have a break from time to time. This Budget proposes a package of assistance to carers amounting to $89m over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these measures concerns an increase to the domiciliary nursing care benefit, DNCB. This Bill contains provisions which, if passed, will enable implementation of that Budget announcement. The domiciliary nursing care benefit provides financial assistance to carers of people over the age of 16 who have been assessed as needing a nursing home level of care. Part 5 of this Bill includes amendments to support three changes to the DNCB to take effect from 6 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment will increase the level of the benefit by $10 to $52 per fortnight from 6 January 1993. The second amendment provides for the Minister to vary this amount from time to time. It is the Government's intention to index the benefit annually on the basis of CPI changes. The third amendment will allow carers to continue to receive the benefit during periods of respite care of up to 42 days a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant increase of the benefit by approximately 25 per cent and its subsequent indexation demonstrates the Government's commitment to the recognition of and support for carers of frail older people and people with disabilities living in the community. The continued payment of the benefit while the person being cared for is in respite care will provide much needed support for carers and allow them to have short breaks from care without loss of benefit. This provision will bring the DNCB into line with provisions applying to similar payments in the social security area. Respite care is the service most highly valued by carers. The Bill also contains amendments concerning funding for new and rebuilt nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a decision in the 1991 Budget, the Government already provides additional recurrent funding for some nursing homes that are newly built or completely rebuilt. The aim of this initiative was to improve the quality of nursing home buildings, and hence to improve the quality of care. The nursing home industry took the view that this initiative would not efficiently meet its objective since a proprietor could apply for the additional funding only after building the new home. They said that a proprietor considering rebuilding his or her home needed an assurance of the additional funding before construction commenced; otherwise he or she would not be able to borrow the money to rebuild. The proposed amendment overcomes this problem, and introduces a system of approvals in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Budget provided funding for approvals in principle for 1992-93 and 1993-94. However, it is possible that many proprietors who do not intend to rebuild their home in the near future will nevertheless apply for an approval in principle just in case they change their minds or in case the State health authorities force them to rebuild. There is therefore a risk that the available approvals in principle will be wasted. To avoid this possibility this legislative amendment allows the approval in principle to be revoked if no progress is made towards the rebuilding. The approvals in principle will then be able to be reallocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes provision for a change in date of effect of reviews of resident classifications. Under the current funding arrangements for nursing homes, the proprietor applies for a classification for a new resident or for a current resident whose classification is about to expire. This classification is based on the resident classification instrument, RCI, which measures a resident's need for nursing and personal care. These classifications are used to determine the amount of funding for nursing and personal care that a home receives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding whether to grant a classification, the Secretary of the Department is guided by principles formulated by the Minister, known as the nursing home classification principles. The Secretary of the Department may at any time review the classification of a resident. If, on the basis of this review, the Secretary decides that the resident has been wrongly classified, the Secretary may revoke the classification and substitute a higher or lower classification. Currently the Secretary is not required to have regard to the nursing home classification principles when reviewing a resident's classification. This is an anomaly, because the purpose of the classification principles is to ensure that all resident classifications are determined by classification principles which are universally applied, according to relative care need. Therefore, this Bill proposes to amend the Act to require the Secretary to observe the nursing home classification principles when reviewing a resident's classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There exists a further anomaly in regard to reviews of classifications. If the review classification is lower than the original classification, the review classification currently takes effect from the date of the review. This is despite the fact that the wrong classification has applied from the date of the original classification. This Bill proposes to amend the period of effect of a review by the Secretary so that the review classification is for the same period as the original classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also means a nursing home will not have as long to wait for a further review of the classification. At present, in the case of a reduced classification, the nursing home has to wait until the review classification has been in force for 12 months. This can be up to one year after the original classification would have expired and delays the opportunity for the nursing home to seek a further classification in cases where the resident's care needs have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will mean that the nursing home will receive a positive or negative adjustment to future funding depending on whether the review classification is higher or lower than the original assessment by the nursing home. This will ensure an appropriate level of funding for the entire 12-month classification period. The nursing home will be able to apply for a further annual classification at the end of that time. The Bill ensures that the new arrangements applying to the period of effect of a review classification, if that review lowers a category, will apply only to classifications determined on or after the date of assent to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act designed to increase equity with regard to hostel subsidies by providing higher subsidies for financially disadvantaged persons, or FDPs. The amendments provide for an increase in funding for each FDP hostel resident, offset by a reduction in funding for non-FDP hostel residents who have been assessed for personal care, PC. It is intended that at all levels of care within a hostel there will be a $3.20 a day subsidy difference between FDP and non-FDP residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hostels have a greater capacity to raise income from their non-FDP residents through avenues such as entry contributions and variable fees. These options are generally not available for hostels catering for FDPs. This can present problems in ensuring access for this group and viability problems for hostels catering predominantly for FDPs. Thus the amendments will benefit hostels accommodating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and other disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently introduced hostel personal care arrangements are based on the assessment of the relative care need of each individual, not their financial status or capacity to pay. This principle is unchanged. Those with higher care needs will continue to get higher subsidies. However, the subsidy at each level will also reflect the financial status of the resident. While some hostels will be disadvantaged in terms of subsidies available, the extent to which hostels will be affected will depend on the financial status of the residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As already indicated, hostels with high levels of non-FDPs have access to higher levels of resident charges. The real impact on the resident and the hostel should be minimal, as the changes, in combination with forthcoming real increases in pensioner income through pension and rental assistance increases, largely offset each other. The overall impact is that the income available to hostels from subsidies and resident payments will be better targeted to support those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to amendments to the aged care area the Bill makes amendments to the arrangements regarding payment of Medicare benefits in relation to R-type diagnostic imaging services. The amendment of subsection 16B(11) of the Health Insurance Act provides for the extension by two years, to 1 January 1995, of the sunset provisions. Under the current sunset provision, from 1 January 1993 Medicare benefits will no longer be payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by medical practitioners who were exempted by the grandparent provisions in the 1991 amendments dealing with arms-length requesting of these services. An extension will allow for the continuation of the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type services in these circumstances. The amendments proposed will provide more time for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to develop accreditation guidelines for general practitioners who provide radiology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the Medicare benefits referral arrangements by inserting a new section 20BA in the Health Insurance Act. The main purpose of the proposed amendment is to require that, where a practitioner refers a patient, in writing, to a consultant physician or a specialist and where the physician or specialist renders a specialist medical service to that patient, the physician or specialist must retain the referral for a period of 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment also proposes that the physician or specialist be required, if requested by the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission, to produce to an officer of the Commission the referral or the patient's hospital records for verification of a referral. Following discussions between the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the medical profession, agreement was reached on revised referral arrangements. This included placing onus of proof that a valid referral took place on the specialist or the consultant physician, that is, the practitioner to whom the patient was referred rather than the referring practitioner. Precedents for the proposed amendment already exist in the Health Insurance Act in respect of requests for pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including the requirement that the referral be retained for a period of 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill rectifies an error in subsection 129AAA(3) of the Health Insurance Act. The amendment to the subsection omits the second occurrence of the word `pathology' before `practitioner' so that the subsection prohibits an approved pathology practitioner from providing nursing and other staff, not only at the premises of the practitioner but also at premises made available to the practitioner by a medical entrepreneur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also reinserts subsection 79(5) in the National Health Act to allow for the cancellation of registration of organisations where the business of all health benefits funds conducted by them have been transferred, in accordance with an approval by the Minister, to funds conducted by other organisations. Subsection 79(5) of the National Health Act was inadvertently repealed by the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not blame me. The proposed amendments of section 4 in the National Health Act in part five of this Bill relate to the payment of Medicare benefits for visits by participating optometrists to private patients in hospital and approved day hospital facilities. Currently, where a visit is made by an optometrists to such patients, the Medicare rebate is 75 per cent of the schedule fee with the health insurance funds required to cover the remaining 25 per cent for insured patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the 75 per cent benefit rebate is contained in the Health Insurance Act, it is linked to the professional service rendered to patients who are receiving hospital treatment as provided for in the National Health Act. When the Health Insurance Act was amended in 1987 to reduce the Medicare benefit for professional services rendered in a hospital or approved day hospital facilities to private patients from 85 per cent (maximum $20 gap) to 75 per cent flat, its unintended application to optometrical consultations was overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patients are not admitted to hospital for conditions requiring the services of an optometrist. An optometrist may visit a hospital as a social service to a patient who has broken his or her spectacles and requires a test for new spectacles. Such patients are most likely to be long stay, nursing home type patients. The 75 per cent flat rate benefit provides a disincentive for optometrists to bulk bill such patients&mdash;the majority of whom would be aged persons. Currently some 87 per cent of optometrical services are direct billed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in this Bill is to amend subsection 4(1) of the National Health Act to exclude optometrical consultations from the definition of professional service for the purpose of that section and as a consequence from the application of the 75 per cent Medicare benefit level provided for in section 10 of the Health Insurance Act. The Bill also closes a loophole which would enable a child, in respect of whom family allowance is not being paid because of the income or assets test, to be declared a disadvantaged person and thus be issued with a health care card and receive pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of patient contribution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that in November 1991 the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority tabled its evaluation of the NCA in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. The report supported the continued existence and activities of the NCA and made 11 recommendations. The Government's response to the PJC report was tabled on 1 June 1992. The National Crime Authority Bill (No.2) 1992 amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in the manner foreshadowed in that response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill establishes an office of Inspector-General of the NCA, endows it with appropriate functions and powers and provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between the NCA and the PJC about access to sensitive information held by the NCA. It also makes some small but important corrections to existing provisions of the NCA Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant change to the NCA Act introduced by these amendments is the new office of Inspector-General of the NCA. Clause 10 of the Bill will insert a new part IIIA in the NCA Act to make provision for this office. The PJC report proposed that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the NCA and its staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA will differ in some respects from the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Bill will establish a separate office of Inspector-General of the NCA under the NCA Act. However, the Government intends that the occupant of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will also be appointed as Inspector-General of the NCA and, with this in mind, the new part IIIA is based as closely as practicable on the relevant provisions of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major difference between the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA and in relation to the intelligence and security agencies will be that he will not have the broad monitoring function in relation to the NCA which he has in relation to intelligence and security matters. General monitoring of the work of the NCA remains the responsibility of the Commonwealth-State Inter-governmental Committee&mdash;the IGC&mdash;and of the PJC, both of which are established under the NCA Act. A second major difference is that, in relation to the NCA, the Inspector-General will not investigate complaints which can be dealt with satisfactorily under existing complaints legislation or procedures applicable to a police force from which the subject of the complaint has been seconded to the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under new section 55AA, the recommendation to the Governor-General that a person be appointed Inspector-General may only be made after consultation with the IGC. The person so appointed will be able to hold the office in conjunction with another, and section 55AC will preserve the judicial status of a judge appointed to the office. The terms and conditions of the Inspector-General, as set out in division six of the new part IIIA, are compatible with those of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Under section 55AZE, where the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is also appointed Inspector-General of the NCA, staff may be appointed to assist him in both capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Inspector-General are set out in proposed new section 55AD. His principal function will be to investigate complaints about the actions of members or staff of the NCA, whether such complaints are made directly or are referred to him by a member of the IGC or by the PJC. Further, on request by the Minister, he will investigate whether NCA information to which access is sought by the PJC on the NCA is `sensitive information' as defined in the Bill, and will advise the Minister accordingly. Lastly, where the Minister so requests, the Inspector-General will monitor compliance by the NCA with directions or guidelines in relation to privacy issued by the Minister under section 18 of the NCA Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 2 of the new part IIIA will provide for the receipt and investigation of complaints. It is proposed that the Inspector-General be obliged to investigate all complaints including those which may have arisen before the passage of this Bill. As is appropriate, however, discretions are built into section 55AG which will enable him not to inquire into complaints which, for instance, are frivolous or vexatious or where, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry or further inquiry is not warranted. The latter category would include past complaints which, in the view of the Inspector-General, have been dealt with satisfactorily by the informal means of investigation which have existed hitherto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 will deal with the conduct of inquiries. The Inspector-General will be required to inform the Minister and the chairperson of the NCA before commencing an investigation. His inquiries will be conducted in private and will not be subject to formal procedural requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will be entitled to compel production of information and documents and to make such use of the documents as may be needed for the purposes of the investigation. He will also be able to compel people to attend before him and give evidence on oath or affirmation, including evidence which they would otherwise be entitled by privilege, or obliged by law, to withhold. The Inspector-General will also have reasonable access to NCA premises for the purposes of an investigation, and special provision is made for the receipt of complaints from persons in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a two-stage reporting process, with a draft report given to the chairperson of the NCA for comment before the final report is submitted to the Minister and the chairperson. The report should include reasons and recommend any restitution considered appropriate for a complainant. The Inspector-General will be required to advise the complainant&mdash;and the IGC or the PJC, if they referred the complaint&mdash;of the outcome of the investigation, so far as this will not prejudice NCA security. The chairperson of the NCA will be required to advise the Inspector-General of his action in response to each report. If dissatisfied with that response the Inspector-General will be entitled to discuss the matter with, and make a written report on it to, the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Inspector-General will be required to provide an annual report to the Minister, commenting on the investigations he has conducted during the past year. The Minister will be required to table the report in each House as soon as practicable after receipt. Provision is made in clause 9 of the Bill for an amendment to section 55 under which the PJC would examine the Inspector-General's annual report. This is intended to provide a means by which the PJC may better inform itself in the performance of its principal function under that section&mdash;that is, the monitoring and reviewing of the NCA's performance. The provision is not intended to suggest accountability on the part of the Inspector-General to the PJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main aspect of the Bill is the provision of a mechanism for resolving disagreement over what is often termed operational or sensitive information. In its recent report, the PJC sought clarification of its rights of access to information held by the NCA. Disputes about such information in the past have given rise to questions of parliamentary privilege. As foreshadowed in its response to the PJC report, the Government has decided to deal with this issue by providing, in a new subsection 55(2), that in the performance of its duties the PJC is entitled to require the chairperson of the NCA to produce to it any document held by the NCA or to divulge or communicate to it any information held by or known to the NCA&mdash;except to the extent that it is or contains sensitive information. `Sensitive information' is defined in an amendment set out in clause 3, as information the disclosure of which might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence, the effectiveness of an investigation by the NCA, or the operations of law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the PJC requests access to information and the chairperson of the NCA refuses access on the ground that the information requested is sensitive, as defined, the amendment to section 55 will allow the PJC to refer the request to the Minister administering the NCA Act for written resolution of the dispute. The Bill provides that the Minister may require the Inspector-General of the NCA to inquire into the matter, and the Inspector-General must do so in accordance with the inquiry provisions of the new part IIIA of the NCA Act. When the Inspector-General has reported to the Minister, the Minister will have to decide whether or not the information is sensitive, and notify the chairperson, the PJC and the Inspector-General of his decision. The Bill will also authorise the Minister to include reasons for the decision in the formal determination, where this can be done without disclosing sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the minor amendments included in the Bill, one affects section 29A of the NCA Act. This section only came into force in January this year and provides that NCA process issued under sections 28 or 29 may include a notation prohibiting disclosure of any information relating to the process. This conflicts with the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, which require agencies to record any disclosures on an individual's credit information file and to ensure that an individual can obtain access to his or her file. Access by an individual to a credit reference file bearing a note of disclosure to the NCA could seriously jeopardise an NCA investigation. Accordingly, clause 7 of the Bill will amend section 29A of the NCA Act to provide that, where the Privacy Act would require that a note be made of a disclosure made in response to NCA process and that process includes a notation requiring secrecy, the requirement to record the disclosure is postponed until the effect of the notation expires. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that this proposal is acceptable because of the particular circumstances. Disclosure is only temporarily prohibited and the policy underlying section 29A was thoroughly debated during its passage through Parliament last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other minor amendment affects section 12 of the Act. As indicated in its response to the PJC report, the Government and members of the intergovernmental committee have considered the position of subsections 12(4) and (5), which were criticised as unclear by the South Australian Supreme Court in the 1989 case of Carbone. Clause 9 of the Bill repeals those subsections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like briefly to reiterate some of the general points made in the statement tabled by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on 1 June. I believe the work of the NCA over the past eight years has by and large been very successful and that this reflects both the qualities of those who have worked in the NCA and the essential soundness of the legislative scheme into which Parliament put so much effort in 1983 and 1984. Nonetheless, there will continue to be a need for fine tuning of the legislation from time to time and I take this opportunity to thank the PJC again for the important contribution it has made to this process through its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a cognate debate on the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which is in fact the resumption of the debate that was adjourned just prior to lunch. As my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said this morning, the coalition does not oppose these Bills. We acknowledge that they introduce a range of measures designed to assist those suffering most as a result of, in the infamous words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the recession we had to have. However, I want to confine my remarks to the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 and specifically to the amendments to section 695 of the principal Act, the Social Security Act 1991. This section deals with the claims for sickness benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments deal with what is described as the education leavers waiting period, which is the deferment period to be served by an education leaver claiming sickness allowance. I want to say at the outset that I am pleased the Government has brought this legislation down at a relatively early stage in this parliamentary session so that there has been and is now still time for due consideration and debate. Sadly, such was not the case back in May 1990, when the Government amended the social security legislation to set a deferment period equivalent to that imposed on claimants for unemployment benefits for anyone leaving the education system and claiming sickness benefits. That amendment, encompassed in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, was rammed through the House under guillotine in less than one hour. At the time, the then Minister for Social Security stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who would suffer severe financial hardship through this initiative may claim special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>While that sounds fine in principle, the practical application of the Minister's statement is another matter. This is the reason why I have entered this debate. The Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 contains the following amendment to section 695:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A person is not subject to an education leavers waiting period if the Secretary is satisfied that special benefit would be payable to the person during the waiting period if the person were subject to the waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA>However, satisfying the Secretary to the Department of Social Security that a special benefit is warranted can be a harrowing experience. While it may be the Government's intention to honour its often stated commitment to social justice and the provision of a social welfare safety net, the Department of Social Security's way of assessing applications for special benefit has, in at least one case with which I am very familiar, worked against giving effect to legislative intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very serious matter, and I would like to show just how serious by drawing the attention of the House to the personal experience of one of my constituents. Back in April 1991, this young woman, whom I will not name in this House for reasons of privacy, was forced to withdraw from tertiary study as a result of extreme ill health. At the time it was evident that she faced a long term incapacity for work. Therefore, on 16 April 1991 she applied to the Department of Social Security for either sickness or special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which that application was handled was documented in a Social Security Appeals Tribunal finding dated 11 June 1991. In summary, the events were as follows: first, the April application was apparently lost by the Department of Social Security, although a note on the applicant's file confirmed that she had been interviewed three days later; second, another file note indicated that she was advised by phone on 9 May 1991 that a deferment period of 13 weeks would be applied to her application; third, on 13 May 1991 she completed a new application for special benefit; fourth, a record of decision on her file indicated that special benefit should be rejected as a result of the application of the short term assets test&mdash;no written advice was provided on any of these decisions, information was given to her over the phone; and, fifth, a new decision not to pay sickness benefit was made on the basis that she had not suffered any loss of income as a result of incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal described the Department's case as `somewhat confused'. On 19 June 1991 the SSAT found that my constituent was entitled to the payment of special benefit from 13 May 1991. The Department, however, decided to appeal against the findings of the SSAT and, on 15 July 1991, it took the matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Again, the Department's appeal was unsuccessful. The Department then decided to take the matter before the Federal Court. By this time my constituent had raised her concerns with the Ombudsman and, on 27 May 1992, Senior Assistant Ombudsman, M. J. Williamson, from the Canberra office of the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman, made the following statement in a letter to my constituent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are convinced, as I know you are, that DSS's overall performance in your case has been unsatisfactory, to put it modestly. Your file is replete with examples of poor administration, including repeated failure to reply to your enquiries or to keep you informed in any other way. With the exception of one or two officers, the Department appears to have ignored your right to be treated with courtesy and consideration. It is disturbing, for example, that you found out that the Department intended to appeal to the Federal Court from Mr Hedges&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who is from the Ombudsman's office in Perth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and not from the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 July this year, the saga which began back in April 1991 came to an end when Mr Justice Lee of the Federal Court dismissed the Department's appeal. Throughout the whole of this process the Government would have incurred tens of thousands of dollars in costs&mdash;all over the matter of some $900. In the judgments of both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, reference was made to the case, turning very much on its own special circumstances. The point of this is that the Department's pursuit of this matter can hardly be regarded as an important test case. After all, a special benefit is just that; it is a benefit granted in special cases of severe hardship, with each case being judged according to the individual's particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason alone, it is not unreasonable to describe the Department's pursuit of appeal after appeal, to the point of legal exhaustion, as a monumental waste of taxpayers' money and government resources. I would be interested to know whether the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett)&mdash;he can take this on notice&mdash;could tell the House what the case actually cost, including the cost in time of officers of his Department who could not perform their normal functions while appearing before the SSAT, the AAT and the Federal Court, not to mention the cost of flying departmental people and legal representatives to Perth. Although my constituent's case was eventually resolved in her favour, her experience has been a traumatic one. The stresses and strains of being involved in three appeals and waiting some 15 months for a final resolution have aggravated the ill health which forced her to withdraw from her studies in the first place and have severely retarded her recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems which she experienced were in large part due to the short term available funds test used by the Department in assessing claims for special benefit. Under this particular test, the Department considers that a person is in severe financial hardship only if he has less than the equivalent of two weeks benefit. For my constituent that amount was $154.10. This short term available funds test is seriously flawed and totally unbalanced, as it does not in any way take account of any financial commitments and liabilities. In this particular case, just one liability amounted to $52 per week. That was the sum of money needed by my constituent each week to meet ongoing medical expenses not covered by Medicare. Perhaps this test was designed for people experiencing a one or two week waiting period. However, a 13 week waiting period can hardly be described as short term. Mr Justice Lee of the Federal Court said in his finding:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direction vested in the Secretary was provided for the clear purpose of alleviating hardship or ameliorating what would otherwise be unnecessary harshness in the operation of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>These concerns which are reflected here are ones I share, and that is why I have raised them in this debate. It is all very well for the Government to legislate to overcome hardship, but it must ensure that its Department administers its legislation in a way which is consistent with meeting that objective. The extremely harsh, short term available funds test is not set out in legislation; it is contained within departmental guidelines and is defective as a result of ignoring liabilities. This deficiency was highlighted by P. Johnson, Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Page 18 of the AAT's finding against the Department's appeal states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Tribunal notes that the Special Benefit Claim Form makes no provision for off-setting liabilities and to that extent does not provide a basis on which an accurate assessment can be made of the claimant's actual financial circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Court judgment of Mr Justice Lee also drew attention to this problem. Page 21 of that judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The printed form provided by the Department for application for a special benefit requested a claimant to supply details of monies to which the claimant had access. The form did not request a statement of any of the current liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly&mdash;and this is the thrust of my case&mdash;it is up to the Government to ensure that this situation is remedied and that departmental guidelines accord with the substance and spirit of the law. My constituent and her family have been through a very trying experience. It is their earnest desire&mdash;and I speak on their behalf&mdash;that no-one else should suffer the same fate. In order to try to help others who might be caught in a similar bureaucratic trap, they have researched and written two detailed and well-balanced papers which offer constructive comments on legislative and administrative arrangements for income support. The first of these papers was submitted to the Government's task force on management improvement within the Australian Public Service and it has been very well received. The other has been forwarded recently to the parliamentary inquiry into legislative and legal drafting by the Commonwealth. This inquiry is currently being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the circumstances surrounding my constituent's case are concerned, I sincerely hope that both the task force and the Committee will take good account of the submissions before them and that some good will come of this family's unhappy experience. The amendment to the social security legislation which is currently before the House has the potential to make life a little easier for those who, like my constituent, are forced to withdraw from the education system as a result of ill health. However, this potential will be realised only if both government legislation and the administrative arrangements within the Department are in accord.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are dealing with certain social security amendment Bills which, ostensibly at least, are designed to assist people during these very difficult times. The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 proposes to allow people access to half of their family allowance payment as a lump sum. This no doubt will help people; although I worry a little that it is another example of this Government's Bankcard mentality. Certainly, people do not have to borrow this money, but by getting it in advance they naturally will find it more difficult once they have  spent the money. One might wonder in that regard whether this has more to do with an election date and giving people a little more spending money to maybe affect some statistics around Australia than it has to do with people's welfare. If that is the case, I would certainly condemn this action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as has been said by previous speakers, the Opposition is supporting these measures. I certainly agree with that situation. However, it brings to the attention of the House, in a more general sense, the very difficult circumstances confronting Australians today. I feel the blame has to be laid right at the doorstep of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was announced in the media last night that the Catholic bishops of Australia would today release a major statement criticising Australian society entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS>. It draws to our attention the fact that in today's society the country's richest one per cent are now owning one-quarter of the nation's wealth. The statement goes on to say that that is the fault of both political parties, community attitudes and so on. But the statistical fact is that that situation has occurred now and this Government is in office now. In terms of those who pull the levers&mdash;which is a common statement in these places&mdash;the blame must be laid very squarely with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a statistical fact that throughout the administration of this Government the so-called poverty gap has widened. The rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. One may wonder how a party which claims to represent the less well-off in our society in particular and which constantly throws criticism at the coalition parties, claiming that they have a different view of these things, can live with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the situation is even worse for the Government. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 15 September an article refers to an employee of government, Ann Harding, as having published a particular report. I will read some of the article because I think it should be understood by all. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government's own social and economic policy analyst has concluded that its indirect-tax policies are hitting struggling families hardest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings, by the Centre of Social and Economic Modelling, undermine the Government's attack on the Coalition's plans for a universal goods-and-services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analysis contradicts the Government also on the implications of the Fightback package, suggesting that it would not be difficult to compensate low-income households for the impact of the GST, and concludes that taxes such as the petrol excise, which would be scrapped under Fightback, were the most regressive taxes of all.</PARA>
<PARA>As a representative of people who live in more remote areas, I would say that those taxes are doubly regressive for those people. Of course, there is plenty of evidence that they were among the first to be hit by the economic recession and depression simply because of their isolation and the recent downturn in the rural sector. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analysis of existing wholesale sales tax and excises was conducted by the director of the centre, Ann Harding, in June.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not so long ago. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a unit in the portfolio of Health, Housing and Community Services.</PARA>
<PARA>which is under the control of this Government. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Harding said that in 1991-92 wholesale taxes and excises had been estimated to provide more than 20 per cent of total government revenue, or nearly $19 billion. However, the burden fell more heavily on low-income households, including those virtually exempt from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ranking assumed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the ranking of families&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that a family of two adults and two children would need an income of $540 a week to reach the same standard of living as a single adult with an income of $200. On the basis of this "equivalent household income", Dr Harding concluded that the Government's indirect taxes were highly regressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families in the lowest ranking paid an average of $31 a week in indirect taxes, or eight times as much as they paid in income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Indirect taxes appear more regressive when households are ranked by an income measure which takes account of their needs," Dr Harding said. "Indirect taxes as a percentage of gross income fall from 10.75 per cent for the bottom decile . . . to 5.1 for the top decile.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Harding's figures showed that the bottom 10 per cent of households paid almost 6 per cent of their gross income in excises, and the top 10 per cent only 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the impact of Fightback on various family types, Dr Harding used a Treasury analysis that showed that the indirect-tax burden would increase by a net $16 a week for a single-income family, with children, in the lowest income bracket. A similar family in the highest income bracket would pay an extra $44 in indirect taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>At this point, Dr Harding is talking about Fightback. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although concluding that indirect taxes in general were regressive, Dr Harding suggested that it was possible to compensate low-income earners for the impact of the GST, as proposed in Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about somebody who earns his or her living from politics; we are talking about a highly respected adviser to government who wrote the Government a letter and said: `You've got it wrong; please do something for the poor people'.

The simple fact is that I have read what has been quoted, and not denied, in our community newspapers&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, in fact. It is a pity that the Minister wants to be a smart alec about a matter as serious as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The researcher has criticised both forms of indirect taxing as being regressive. She has been very even-handed in this and I did not try to hide that fact in my presentation. But she said&mdash;and it is patently obvious&mdash;that we can compensate for a GST but we cannot compensate, or this Government has certainly never attempted to compensate, for the burdens of its indirect tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to see why we can compensate for a GST. It is out in the open; it is up-front. It will be printed on every docket, be it at the supermarket or on a docket received for some other things. It is clear for people to see in the first instance. Down at the bowser there will be no more of this business of ripping 26c a litre off people and not telling them. We will no longer see the price of petrol go up and not know who is getting the money&mdash;be it the Government, the retailer or the wholesaler&mdash;because it will be shown separately. The coalition is determined to ensure that that occurs at every level. The first thing the public will be able to do is make a judgment as to what would be appropriate compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fact of life is that the Treasury has made it very clear that there will be a CPI effect of 3 or 4 per cent. It is interesting to note that on 26 May in this place the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that the effect would be 4.7 per cent and on the same day the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said it would be 5 per cent or 6 per cent, which does not say much for their figuring. In other words, they are grabbing numbers out of the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even if the CPI effect is 3 or 4 per cent, or one of those other figures, the Opposition has set out in its policies to make sure the compensation is available. It recognises the fact, as identified by Dr Harding, seeks to identify what the problem might be, and offers highly identifiable compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be substantial tax cuts for wage and salary earners at the low end of the market. If, for instance, one had a taxable income of $10,000 a year, the tax rate would be 5c in the dollar. At the more recognisable and more typical income of $20,000 a year, the tax would be 10c in the dollar. There is a substantial reduction in the tax burden at the income tax level, giving people money to take home to confront a 3 or 4 per cent increase. But it does not stop there. I found it interesting when I was shadow Minister for health to have identified to me how many single mothers have private health insurance. They do it because they are terrified of the current system. We had someone lauding it at Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to relate a story about the Swan District Hospital, which I think is in the electorate of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). A 21-year-old girl, a close friend of my daughter's, fell off a horse early on Saturday morning and broke her arm in a very bad way above the elbow and below the shoulder. She went to the Swan District Hospital, which gave her some aspirin, sent her home and told her to come back on Monday because orthopaedic surgeons no longer worked on weekends. The outrageous part about that is that they did not even have the decency to ask her whether she had private health insurance&mdash;which she did&mdash;and direct her to a private hospital, where she certainly would have received assistance. They might also have told her to go to the casualty section of Royal Perth Hospital. I became aware of this on Saturday night when the young lady was vomiting through pain, and we were able to assist her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of things happen, but the tragedy of that example is that the young lady accepted it. People have lost so much confidence in the health system that she believed the system could not look after her on weekends. She just went home. She is not dumb&mdash;she has a highly paid position in a solicitor's office&mdash;but she believed that people cannot be fixed up in Australia on a weekend. That is a great indictment of the system. That is a matter of fact. The young lady's name is available if anybody wants to try to disprove what I am saying. I did not know what to do. I was devastated to think things were so bad in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of problems we have, but what do we do about them? Supporting mothers, on very limited incomes, are taking out private health insurance because they do not trust the health system. What is the Opposition saying to those supporting mothers? We are saying, `We'll give you a $400 a year special rebate. It is a tax rebate, but it applies even if you have no income. We will send you a refund cheque'. To the elderly we are saying, `If you are on a pension, we will put it up by 8 per cent to compensate a perceived 3 to 4 per cent increase in your cost of living brought about by our consumption tax'. What are we saying to all the other pensioners&mdash;supporting mothers and unemployed mothers? We are saying, `We'll increase yours by 6 per cent'. What are we saying to the elderly? We are saying, `We'll give you $800 a year if you buy private health insurance and do your non-insured colleagues a favour by getting out of the road and giving them greater opportunity to get into public hospitals'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doubling the family allowance to $40 a fortnight per child. Why? It is because we believe in giving the compensation necessary, but we can also identify the tax burden. The Government rabbits on in here day after day, saying, `But your tax is going to tax food'. We do not resile from that; we admit to it. We have given the figures, confirmed by Treasury, as to the overall economic effect of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the people Dr Harding is talking about, and the people the bishops are talking about, seldom hire lawyers or expensive accountants. They will not be taxed on that. They will not be taxed on their mortgage; they will not be taxed on their income tax. We are talking about a 3 or 4 per cent increase to about one-third of their income. We are giving them a 30 per cent tax cut, doubling their family allowance and increasing the dependent spouse rebate, et cetera. While the Government gets on with the idea of withholding taxes on their meagre interest earnings on their small savings accounts, we are saying that they can have some interest income free of tax. We have identified that there is a burden. We do not resile from it; we provide the appropriate compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says there is no tax on food, yet we draw to its attention the fact that just in the area of transport an owner-driver truckie pays about $1,000 a week in one consumer tax or another, starting with close to $1,000 a month in lease payments associated with the sales tax on his truck.

I can tell honourable members quickly, because we have done the research, how many times payroll tax, sales tax and fuel tax impact on a package of butter: 220 times. And Government members say there is no tax on it! The trouble is that they find it extremely difficult to calculate and, as Dr Harding reminds them, they therefore do not compensate. Only a GST can be clearly identified. As a result, it is only then that governments can give proper compensation, as the coalition properly provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We will support this legislation, but we do not perceive that giving people in receipt of family allowance a bit of money in advance and then letting them be poor six months later is the solution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bishops tell Government members the problem, and their own public servants tell them the problem, but they get up here and say, `There is no tax on a loaf of bread'. If there is 10 per cent tax on that loaf of bread&mdash;and I believe there will be by the time the freight aspect is considered&mdash;and 15 per cent is added after that tax is taken off, the increase is 3 or 4 per cent. That is exactly what we, the Federal Treasury and everybody else says will be the CPI effect of our introducing this tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what this so-called Labor Government has done to the poor people in this country, to families in this country. Figures taken by the Social Policy Research Centre of the University of New South Wales show that between 1983 and 1990 families with average incomes or below experienced a drop of 4 per cent in real disposable income. Between 1983 and 1991 the percentage of children living in poverty actually increased, with 1.85 million Australians now living below the Henderson poverty line and 1.1 million living in absolute poverty. In 1982-83, the average after-tax earnings of an average family with a dependant spouse and two children was $24,891 in 1989 dollar terms. In 1989, after six years of a Labor government, that family's after-tax earnings dropped by $1,291 to $23,000. That is what this Labor Government has done for the families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But they are not the only figures available which show what has happened to families in Australia under this Government. Let us look at some work done by the School of Economic and Financial Studies at Macquarie University in an article by Marc Lombard entitled `Income Distribution in Australia 1983-1989'. One table in this article tells us what has happened to the top one per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent of income earners compared with the bottom group of income earners. In 1982-83, the top 5 per cent received 13 per cent of income but by 1988-89 that had risen to 18 per cent. These high income earners had increased their percentage of income quite considerably. Over the same period the bottom 20 per cent decreased; they went from 8.24 to 6.79. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we further examine some of these figures that Mr Lombard has produced, we see that in 1983 the top 5 per cent of income earners had a 1 1/2 times greater share of the national income cake than those in the bottom 20 per cent. That was bad enough; however, what happens after six years of Labor Government?  By that time, the top 5 per cent had increased their share of the national cake compared with the lowest 20 per cent by 2 1/2 times. That is under this so-called social justice government, the Labor Government which is supposedly for the poor, for the lower income earners. Again I say,  what hypocrisy. Mr Lombard's article states:</PARA>

Six years later, the 79,000 taxpayers representing the top 1% of income-earners were earning as much as the bottom 1,666,000 income-earners.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the matter that the honourable member for O'Connor raised, which is the statement by the Catholic bishops entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Wealth for the Common Good</EMPHASIS>. An AAP release reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bishops found a `great and increasing inequality of wealth and income in Australia' with the rich getting richer, the poor just maintaining their position, and middle income citizens getting significantly poorer.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what I read previously in the article by Marc Lombard, and it was also displayed in the study conducted by the University of New South Wales. So it is not just one study that brings this up. Everybody who has studied what has happened under this Labor Government has found out that the poor have been hit. They have been hit coming, going and everywhere. While the rich have got richer, the poor have got right down there and are a lot poorer. According to the bishops, one of the main causes of poverty is unemployment. From <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice Trends</EMPHASIS>, which is published by the Catholic Church, I will quote what else the bishops found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bishops have found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 10 years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the 10 years of this Labor Government, the so-called social justice government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of people on social security payments has more than doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*In the same time, the proportion of national income reaching middle-income people has dropped significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Recent research suggests that three in 10 Australians not only own no wealth, but owe more than they own.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, back to the Bankcard mentality fostered by this Government, which puts $20.5 billion of its Budget on Bankcard. Australian poor families are forced proportionally to do the same. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Other research points to a shrinking middle class, with sole parents, unemployed, disabled people and families who lack a breadwinner making up the bulk of the growing new poor.</PARA>
<PARA>The next point states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Income of the nation's most wealthy may have fallen slightly over the past three years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>due to the recession induced by this Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but has more than trebled over the past eight.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that statistic relate to lower income families? Does the Minister tell the workers in the factories that, under his Government, the poor have got a lot poorer, those in the middle classes have almost disappeared and the wealthy have trebled their income? What a great Labor Government! Finally, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . over 200,000 households are on public housing lists, refuges for the homeless are stretched, charities face funding shortfalls and many people are now unable to afford legal and medical costs, the Bishops say.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister does not seem to be taking any interest in this. I take it that he does not care what has happened to the poor and to the 200,000 households that are on public waiting lists. As we have mentioned public housing lists, let us have a look at what has happened under this Government to the affordability of housing. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Affordability of Australian Housing</EMPHASIS> by the National Housing Strategy. What does it say this Government has done to housing affordability? If we look at 1982, we see that families on lower average weekly earnings spent $117 a week in 1990 dollars on their house payment. By 1988, that had risen to $129, which is a considerable portion of a family's income. However, when we look at the base that is needed for people to buy a house&mdash;the deposit they have to pay&mdash;the situation is considerably worse. In 1983, the deposit for an average house required 109.6 per cent of the average income. By 1990, that had risen to 215.8 per cent; it had doubled. That is what has happened under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families who 10 years ago could have hoped to have owned their own house can no longer do it; they are on the public housing list. They cannot have a house that will belong to them and that their children will grow up in. It has become a hopeless dream for most people&mdash;or one might call it a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to an article mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor entitled `The Incidence of Wholesale Sales Tax and Excises in Late 1991'. The Minister asked the honourable member for O'Connor whether he had read the article. I will be quoting from that article. Let us look at what happens to families' incomes because of this Labor Government's hidden taxes&mdash;not all its taxes, just the wholesale sales tax and the excise. What does that do to the average family or, more importantly perhaps, families on low incomes? Of a gross income of $290.70, it takes $31.30 per week; that is, 10.8 per cent of a family's income goes on the Government's hidden consumption taxes. The GST, which those opposite like to say is a consumption tax, is going to hit poor families. The Government omits to say that it already has hidden consumption taxes hitting those families: $31.30 per week, which is 10.8 per cent of their gross income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do these taxes hit the richer families? We are talking about equity. What do we really mean by equity? How do these taxes hit them? An amount of $81.85 is spent by upper income families with a gross income of $1,622, which is 5 per cent. What a regressive tax system. The Government has hit the lower income people: 10.8 per cent of their gross income goes in hidden consumption taxes, while the rich have only 5 per cent. I want to make it clear that those figures are rated for families on lower incomes. That table takes into account the number of children in the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote briefly from the article mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor. Ann Harding refers to the GST&mdash;the consumption tax that the Government keeps attacking. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Treasury analysis that showed that the indirect-tax burden&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the GST&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would increase by a net $16 per week for a single-income family, with children, in the lowest income bracket.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same family I was just talking about, the family that paid $31.30 in hidden taxes. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although concluding that indirect taxes in general were regressive, Dr Harding suggested that it was possible to compensate low-income earners for the impact of the GST, as proposed in Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what Fightback does. We have said that low income earners will be hit by the indirect taxes, but we can overcome that. We make some attempt to compensate them, but the present Government does not. The present Government has reduced families to poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the edification of the Minister, as he does not seem to be aware of it, I will briefly go through what Fightback offers to families; what this Liberal Government will give to families to help pick them up from the shambles that 10 years of this Labor Government has left them in. First, family allowances will be doubled for families with combined incomes below $30,000 per annum. For a low income family with two children, currently getting $41.80, that amount will be doubled; they will get over $80&mdash;an increase of over $40. It makes the Government's lump sum payment of $100-odd pale into insignificance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback is weighted towards the lower income earners, because families with combined incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 will have their family allowances increased by 50 per cent, while families with combined incomes of over $40,000 will receive a 6 per cent increase in their family allowance. A family allowance supplement will be maintained and increased by 6 per cent. The independent spouse rebate will be increased by $300 per annum. That again will phase out as incomes rise over $75,000. We have $90m set aside to help lower income families cope with the problem of child care. Family crisis care is needed because those opposite have put families into crisis. The Government has sent them to St Vincent de Paul; to the local community church&mdash;to whoever will give them a handout to help them get through the week. We are going to help those people. We are going to help my local churches that are absolutely inundated with requests. We will be giving $50m to help those voluntary organisations help the people that those opposite have sent into poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of taxation, the honourable member for O'Connor dealt with the way that we will cut taxation for the lower income people. I remind the Minister that One Nation did not cut their tax; it cut the tax of those people in the next income bracket. So, under this Government, people on the lower incomes will still pay 20c in the dollar. Under our proposal they will pay only 16.2c. What is more, under our proposal, the tax threshold will rise from $5,400 to $7,000, which will be a boon for lower income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the first home owners scheme, families earning up to $40,000 and saving to buy their first home will be eligible for a one-off payment of $2,000. There will also be a health rebate for those families paying private health insurance. Finally, for young people trying to buy a house, to increase housing affordability $1,000 of interest on new savings will be tax free. This Government cannot even come close to any of that. The best it can offer is to take some of its child allowance up front and pay it back later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;It is interesting that this debate today on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been extraordinarily wide ranging, covering a series of issues that have very little to do with the legislation, I must say. But I want to concentrate on some of the specifics that have been raised in the debate before I get on to the more general points made by Opposition and Government members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin with the very obvious statement, to counter some of the nonsense that has been uttered by the Opposition today, that the Keating Government is very much committed to the notion of social justice for all Australians and these two pieces of legislation, along with some of the other changes that the Government has made over the last few years, amply demonstrate that commitment. It is significant that very few of the Opposition members were prepared to knock in any way the propositions being put forward in the legislation dealing with the options for family allowance payment and with the education leavers waiting periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opening the debate, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said that he saw family allowance as not being intended as a series of lump sum payments. This is certainly not the proposal that is in the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2). The point is that it is an option to receive the payment as a lump sum. It is all about flexibility in terms of providing options to people who wish to take advantage of them. It is interesting that in his contribution he referred to the education leavers waiting period, yet there is no specific mention of that notion in Fightback. He went on to say that the Opposition has reduced the waiting periods in its employment strategy, but he was not talking about the education leavers waiting period. As I understand it, he was talking about people on Job Search allowance who get a job and lose it within a period of three months; they will not be required to serve a further waiting period for the Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aspects in Fightback relating to changes in family allowance were also raised by members of the Opposition and I would like to make some comment about them. Finally, there was the usual rhetoric we have come to expect from Opposition members about the benefits of the 15 per cent consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right throughout this debate there was a theme about families and really, I suppose, an attempt to stereotype families within the community. Some of the speeches from Opposition members today showed that they are very much aligned to the stereotype view of what constitutes a family. Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document presents an image of an average Australian family story, with Mike, the housewife, Sally, and their two children. I for one do not deny in any way that that constitutes a family. But I point out that that stereotype view of a family within Australia represents about 22 per cent of all households. For example, tonight in Sydney there are probably upwards of one million people living alone in houses. Those people surely would see themselves as part of a family, but they do not fit this picket fence stereotype view of a family that we have come to expect from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while pointing out some of the down sides in the Fightback material because they have not been brought out in this debate when we have heard notions of social justice echoed by some of the Opposition speakers. For example, during my time in the House during the debate, I heard no mention of any of the Opposition's proposals to slash $10 billion from government expenditure. There was no mention of the fact that part of that $10 billion involves cuts in the social security budget of about $2.4 billion. Of course, all of this would be compounded very much by the extraordinarily regressive consumption tax that would be put on a whole range of products and services that people use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a lot of rhetoric about the changes in family allowance proposed in Fightback. But, again, I do not recall hearing anything about the fact that under the Opposition's arrangements no family allowance will be payable once a family's income reaches $55,000 per annum. There are about 115,000 families with a joint gross income above $55,000 who would lose about $10 per week under the Opposition's proposal. With average weekly earnings now at over $30,000 a year, one can quickly do the sums and work out that a lot of two-income families would receive not one cent under the Opposition's proposal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a little unclear as to whether the proposed income threshold is in 1991 dollars or 1994 dollars. If the $55,000 is to apply in 1994, its relative value is even less. What those opposite are really saying is that people on salaries over $46,000 would not be paid any family allowance. That would mean that about 300,000 families would get not even one cent of family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting aspect of the Opposition's proposals is that there would be very significant poverty traps for families at the $30,000 and $40,000 thresholds. For example, a three-child family earning $29,900 would receive $120 per fortnight in family allowance but, if the income increased by just $100 per annum to $30,000 the family would face a $30 per fortnight drop in the family allowance. Significantly, that would disadvantage a lot of middle income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting part of the debate related to the issue of sole parent pensioners in our community. Again, there was no mention of the fact that under the Opposition's Fightback proposals once the youngest child of a sole parent pensioner turned 12 years of age, the pensioner would no longer be eligible for that pension. Again, some 30,000 people would clearly lose their entitlement to the sole parent pension. Many sole parent pensioners within the community represent the very low end of the socio-economic spectrum within society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is a case of this stereotype image; the Opposition tends to move in very quickly on the sole parent pensioners. It forgets about the jobs, education and training scheme and the fact that JET has assisted more than 80,000 sole parent pensioners since its introduction in 1989. The proportion of sole parent pensioners on earned income has increased from 9 per cent in 1983 to 21 per cent in 1992. Similarly, labour force participation for sole parent pensioners rose from 44 per cent to 55 per cent. In other words, the very positive steps that this Labor Government has taken have had a remarkable impact upon the sole parent pensioner client group within the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the goods and services tax. We heard a lot about the 15 per cent consumption tax during the debate. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) claims that the GST would result in price rises of a little over 4 per cent. But again, when people go through the Treasury analysis of some elements of the GST, I think they can make their own judgments as to the way in which it would impact upon families&mdash;that food prices would rise by about 8.9 per cent overall; dairy products by 9.6 per cent; clothing by 11.2 per cent; electricity costs by 10.7 per cent; and health services by a staggering 22.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those particular goods, all of those particular services, are the sorts of goods and services that families in Australia have to deal with on a day by day basis. The Opposition claims that all social security pensioners and beneficiaries, family allowance supplement recipients and education allowance recipients would receive adequate compensation for the price effects of the goods and services tax. However, the Opposition's compensation promises are really dependant upon the achievement of its estimated price rise of just over 4 per cent from the package. Under the Opposition's proposals, Australians would be committed to a permanently higher rate of inflation. The impact of that on housing would, of course, be fairly dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the individual contributions made by other members during the debate, and in particular I wish to comment on some of the extraordinary claims made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). In the course of the debate he talked about the proposal of allowing people the option to bring forward $135.85 every six months as a `grubby little bribe'. I challenge the honourable member for McPherson to go out among his constituents and suggest to them that what the Government is proposing is some `grubby little bribe'. What we are doing is allowing people the option, the flexibility, to make their own judgments. That judgment, that option, is based on research that has been conducted by the Department of Social Security into representations that have been made to us by government and, I am sure, by Opposition members, which have very strongly endorsed the option of providing this form of payment to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard some very strong rhetoric from the honourable member for McPherson in attacking the notion of sole parent pensions and benefits, again to reinforce his image of the family within our community. It gets back to this extraordinarily narrow definition that Opposition members continue to use about families in the course of this debate. I thought the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) gave an extraordinarily strong reply to the challenge issued by the honourable member for McPherson to address the ALP's commitment to families. In my view, he did so admirably, not that there was any great challenge from the contribution by the honourable member for McPherson to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) made a strong contribution, particularly with respect to the option of bringing forward the family payment from 1 January next year. The honourable member for Forde made very strong representations on this particular issue in the course of the year, and I certainly would not deny her some sort of ownership of the $135.85 optional up-front payment on the family allowance from January next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the notification of the changes was raised by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) during his contribution. I would certainly like to assure the honourable member&mdash;and indeed other members of this House&mdash;that the Department of Social Security is very much aware of its obligation to advise clients. In fact, we are probably the biggest single user of Australia Post services in terms of client advice letters. Certainly, clients will be advised of those changes well before 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), again indicated his very strong interest in matters affecting social justice within this House and I think contrasted rather sharply with the rhetoric and, at times, bizarre comments of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). I guess most people here are fairly used to the histrionics of and the great amateur actor in the honourable member for Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) raised an issue about a particular constituent who had been affected by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I am not sure of the specific details because when I was coming to the House I missed the first part of his contribution. I will certainly undertake to provide the honourable member for Tangney with what information I can on the particular costs of the appeal case that he raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was fairly typical in his contribution. Again, I guess we are all pretty used to his histrionics with respect to any debate within this House. In fact, I was extremely provoked&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;during his contribution and could not restrain myself from commenting on some of the extraordinary claims that he was making during the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor talked about the Harding study on the GST, as did the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus). Generally speaking, of course, indirect taxes are reggressive but, importantly, our wholesale sales tax system exempts most food and clothing, while taxing luxury items at a much higher rate. It is certainly less regressive than any notion of a 15 per cent goods and services tax on virtually everything one cares to name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very clear that the Fightback package would see a very dramatic shift to indirect taxation in this country and would certainly change the nature of the very progressive taxation system that we have. There would be a greater share of tax revenue, which would come from the indirect tax&mdash;a 15 per cent tax on food, clothing, transport and other necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members referred to Dr Harding's paper. What they conveniently forget to mention is that her analysis of the Fightback package also found that not everyone would be worse off as a result of the GST. Only 70 per cent of members of the population would be worse off, and they are the ordinary wage and salary earners that many people sometimes forget. Those who would gain the most are higher income earners. For example, families earning $90,000 or more would be up to $105 a week better off, while struggling families would certainly bear the brunt of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall it has been a fascinating debate in one sense. We have heard very little about the education leaver waiting period. We have heard very little criticism of the option of allowing people to bring forward their family allowance payment. Clearly, most of the Opposition members in the course of this debate ranged fairly widely in their remarks. In many cases, their remarks were very much at odds with the specific aspects of this debate. Nonetheless, it is worth while to reflect on those comments and for people to make their own judgment. As we get closer to the next election, people will certainly make their judgments about the relative merits of the contribution of this Government with respect to social justice and those notions of social justice that we hear about from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is an incredible gap between those respective policies. The family measures that were announced in the Budget and in the recent One Nation statement continue to reflect this Government's continuing commitment to social justice, and indicate that that pattern has not changed in any way since the Labor Government was elected in 1983. That is in stark contrast, I would suggest, to the Opposition's Fightback package and to some of the notions of so-called social justice that we hear there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The choice for Australian families has never been more stark. Only the Keating Government can deliver the sort of society that we want for our children's future. These two particular, very specific measures in the Department of Social Security are a further indication of the progressive changes that this Government has been making, and I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill makes a number of changes to the Development Allowance Authority Act to widen the scope and increase the flexibility of the development allowance provided for in the original legislation. The amendments contained in this Bill will allow the aggregation of new productive facilities with other projects, consisting of the expansion, upgrading or improvement of existing facilities where the new and existing productive facilities are vertically integrated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two new types of scheme are introduced with this legislation and are described as an individual project scheme, and a joint venture project scheme. These new types of schemes will allow projects involving new productive facilities to be added to projects involving such things as the expansion of existing productive facilities to qualify for the allowance, and meet the $50m threshold test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill provides for greater flexibility in combining purchased and leased assets in a project to be aggregated so that it can meet the $50m threshold test for the granting of the allowance. A mechanism is also introduced whereby a lessor can claim the development allowance benefit by way of a pre-qualifying certificate that has been issued by the Development Allowance Authority to the lessee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also to be a new vertical integration test, and a number of other consequential amendments to the original legislation. The development allowance and the Development Allowance Authority that administers it are both creatures of the Government's `One Nation: One Job' statement in February of this year. It was one of a host of Government initiatives that seek a solution to Australia's problems by throwing taxpayers money around in an attempt to get the economy moving again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was predictable, it is the various one job initiatives that have been one of the major contributors to the blow out in the Budget deficit which is itself one of the country's main economic problems. The Government is thus trying to cure our economic difficulties by exacerbating one of the elements of the overall economic problem, for which it is largely responsible. This is a strategy that is</PARA>
<PARA>bound to fail, but it is the only one the Government could stitch together, given its limited imagination in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Job' statement and the many initiatives associated with it, such as the Development Allowance Authority, have since largely vanished from the political arena. The `One Nation: One Job' statement lasted all of one day, before being buried under the weight of its essential irrelevance to solving of economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite are very proud of the One Job statement and are in the habit of stuffing letterboxes with leaflets showing their constituents where all the upgraded roads and railways are going to be. This must come as great news, I suppose, to those of their constituents who are currently unemployed as a result of their Government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's unemployed could do without a government that is obsessed with railway tracks and all the other infrastructure white elephants being promoted by this Government as the solution for our problems. The whole idea of having an economic recovery led by public sector infrastructure projects would be a joke, if it were not for the serious nature of our economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's public sector infrastructure is a chronic under-performer by world standards, and throwing more money into public sector investment is not going to deliver a reasonable return without fundamental micro-economic reforms on the railways, the water-front and in a host of other areas. It is little wonder then that the response to One Nation has been so underwhelming. This Bill can be seen as a forlorn attempt to revitalise one of the `One Job' statement's taxation initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I shall demonstrate, the development allowance is a complete failure as a means of revitalising and sustaining business investment in this country, which has reached a record in the low levels attained in recent years. The coalition opposed the development allowance legislation when it was first introduced in the autumn sittings this year. There is nothing in this Bill that would cause us to modify our original evaluation as to the establishment of the development allowance and the Authority that will administer it. There are numerous problems with this whole concept of government administered development allowances which grant concessional tax treatment for the cost of acquiring new plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Job' statement laid down a number of criteria that an investment project must satisfy to qualify for the development allowance. In order to receive the allowance, a project must be shown to be world competitive&mdash;in the language of the `One Job' statement&mdash;as to the proposed practices of employers and employees and the practices of all levels of government under which the project must operate. World competitive projects are to be identified, in terms of the legislation, on the basis of an absence of industry assistance or protection; positive facilitation by local and State governments, with the Commonwealth Government providing complementary action where required; and world best practice in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful, however, whether the investment projects which may attract the development allowance will exhibit these qualities or live up to these criteria in the manner suggested by the Government. Despite the legislated injunction against industry assistance, the requirement for positive facilitation by other levels of government is virtually a standing requirement that State and local governments provide assistance of one type or another for projects within their jurisdiction in order that those projects might qualify for the allowance. The allowance thus encourages, and possibly effectively requires, State and local governments to get into the business of picking winners and introducing a mass of distortion into the economy as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this begs the question: why do these projects need special tax breaks if they are indeed already world competitive? After all, that is one of the criteria for getting the allowance. World competitive projects run on the basis of best international practice should not require any assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of tax breaks which must ultimately be paid for by other taxpayers who will be required to bear a heavier tax burden as a consequence. If these projects were less than world competitive, we should be even less inclined to support them in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reason to believe, however, that the Government intends to use the development allowance as provided for under this legislation to do exactly that and support under-competitive investment projects by Australian industry. For a start, the competitive test is to be waived completely for the first round of applicants for the development allowance if they apply before the magic date&mdash;the end of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the criteria for the competitiveness test are given scant attention in the explanatory memorandum to the original legislation, although they are mentioned in clauses in the legislation itself. This suggests that the Government will be giving scant attention to these criteria when it comes to interpreting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Descriptions in explanatory memoranda often reveal the Government's true intentions with legislation it proposes. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) noted in his second reading speech to the original Bill that the allowance will provide firms with additional leverage to negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda. Again, this suggests that allowance recipients are less than fully competitive at the time of granting of the allowance if they have progress to make in achieving so-called best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this legislation reeks of the now thoroughly discredited practice of governments attempting to pick winners. This is made abundantly clear in the descriptions of this measure provided by the Government. The Minister, in his second reading speech to the original legislation, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put simply, the development allowance rewards success and represents a conscious rejection of those policies of the past which underwrote loss and failure.</PARA>
<PARA>So this legislation is designed to reward success, which sounds just like another attempt at picking winners to me. Furthermore, what the Minister conveniently forgets is that those policies of the past that he rightly observes underwrote loss and failure also sought to reward success in much the same way as the development allowance intends. The fact that those policies of the past ended up underwriting loss and failure was an entirely unintended consequence of those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, the Government has no business underwriting success, in any case. Successful businesses can and do look after themselves. Unsuccessful businesses should be allowed to fail. It is as simple as that. The Government says that the development allowances are not to be allocated on the basis of preferred industry sectors and therefore will not benefit preferred projects or enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in making such bold statements, the Government is ignoring the fact that any such scheme inevitably requires that the Government make judgments as to how these allowances are to be best allocated. The preferences and judgments of the bureaucrats who administer these schemes and make these decisions will inevitably enter into the equation so that the Government cannot avoid falling into the trap of picking winners in its administration of the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Needless to say, governments have a lousy record in making these judgments. Bureaucrats isolated in Canberra, or anywhere else for that matter, are hardly in a position to know or to judge the commercial and marketing imperatives driving a particular investment project by a competent business enterprise. For bureaucrats to be telling Australian businesses what constitutes world best practices is, for the most part, simply laughable. The public sector has little to teach and a great deal to learn from the private sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the entrepreneur in the marketplace can make the necessary commercial judgments and, even then, the entrepreneur is not infallible, as we all know only too well, given the excesses of the 1980s. But, at least when the entrepreneur fails, the cost is borne by himself and the shareholders who mistakenly invested with him and not by the general public who, under schemes such as the development allowance, have no role in the decision-making that might lead to the failure of the investment and their consequential loss as taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of other problems with the development allowance as it is presently constituted. The total capital cost threshold of $50m is arbitrary and obviously highly distortionary. It encourages the vertical integration of production processes for the purpose of claiming the allowance, even though such integration may not be optimal in terms of a particular production process. Highly efficient and productive capital projects which just happen to fall below the $50m threshold do not qualify for the allowance. The result is a potential misallocation of resources in favour of larger investment projects at the expense of smaller, potentially more productive, projects and at the cost of overall economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government shows little or no appreciation of the difficulties that confront an initiative such as the development allowance, despite a wealth of experience and analysis that points to the repeated failure of such measures. But it would be naive to think that this was of any real concern to the Government, in any event. The Government's real objective with the development allowance is to get a few big ticket capital projects registered with the Development Allowance Authority before the end of 1992, so that they can be touted by the Government at the next election as evidence of some sort of recovery in business investment. That is why the competitiveness test has been waived, but only until the end of the year. The Minister gave the game away in his second reading speech to the original legislation, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Encouraging projects of this magnitude will induce confidence in our economic future.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds very much like a line from an ALP pamphlet for the next election, to be accompanied by photos of projects that might benefit from the development allowance at some stage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment Bill is obviously designed to maximise the number of companies that will qualify for the development allowance, if only on paper, by increasing the scope and flexibility of the existing legislation. Many of these projects can then be knocked on the head, after the next election, when they no longer have any political value for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political import of this legislation is perhaps indicated by the fact that it was left to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton) to deliver the second reading speech to this amendment Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So what, he asks. Usually it is left to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to present Treasury Bills to the House and usually without his understanding anything in them. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister also found occasion to address the development allowance, in one of his rare speeches to the House, when he spoke to the original legislation earlier this year. The Parliamentary Secretary demonstrated in that speech that he understood nothing about the criticisms that have been made over the years of the practice of picking winners. He said of that legislation, to which this Bill is closely related:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is assistance not about picking winners but about rewarding and encouraging the proven winners, the people who create wealth for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>But who is it that decides, according to this legislation, who are the proven winners who are to be encouraged and rewarded? It is the Government that decides. If that is not picking winners, then I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary then spoke about the need for `selective industry assistance', and said that we must look at the Asian tigers, Germany and Japan `to find the way forward'. He completely ignored the Industry Commission's detailed criticisms of selective industry assistance made in its 1989-90 annual report. There is a chapter in that report entitled `Strategic Trade Theory and the East Asian Experience', which demonstrates exactly why the approach taken with this legislation is precisely the wrong way to go. The Industry Commission concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic success in Japan and the dynamic Asian economies (DAEs) cannot be closely associated with strategic Government interventions . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry specific assistance, far from being a prerequisite for success is likely to be harmful, especially if it is extensive and maintained over long periods.</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Secretary also spoke of some of his experiences with the major projects facilitation unit, in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. He spoke of a mineral development that apparently depended for its viability on the availability of this allowance. This is just further evidence of the fact that the allowance will be used by the Government to underpin marginal investments that are undercompetitive in the normal course of events. The naivety of the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter is alarming, and one would hope that in future he will pay more attention to the Industry Commission than to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way ahead for Australia is not down the path of `selective industry assistance', as that assistance is commonly understood. The way ahead for Australia lies in relieving industry and Australians more generally of the burden of Government at all levels. When Australian industry is relieved of the burden of paying for the special privileges of the few industries and firms favoured by the Government, then Australia will be that much more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time we realised that it is not within the capacity of government to identify investments, businesses or industries that are likely to be successful in the future, and then to go about trying to underwrite that success no matter how inconsequential that underwriting may prove to be. Governments and their bureaucrats have no special insight in considering these matters. More commonly, governments are thoroughly ignorant of the market and the demands it places on industry. If governments have no special knowledge in these matters, then they have nothing to contribute to the judgments that entrepreneurs already make in a market context, on a daily basis. For the most part, the private investor himself is unsure about the future success of a project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The knowledge required to make such a judgment is dispersed in the marketplace and only becomes available to the investor after the investment has been made and a product or service marketed. Even then, there is no accounting for what shifts will take place in the market which will completely change the viability of the underlying investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government has no business in underwriting or otherwise contributing to investments made by the private sector. If the Government were serious about revitalising investment spending on plant and equipment, whether it be for small or large projects, then there are a host of things it could do. It could start by removing indirect taxes on businesses, such as wholesale sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax and the Government's various levies, such as the training guarantee and superannuation guarantee levies. It could lower business costs by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports, so that Australian business could access goods at world prices. It could tackle industrial relations issues such as work practices and the centralised wage fixing system to enable workers and managements to link wages to workplace productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has said that, when in government, it will be looking to introduce special tax measures to benefit large scale investment projects, from which income is delayed, and the capacity to distribute accruing tax losses to shareholders. The difference between our proposals and the Government's development allowance is that our tax measures will be available across the board and not to a select few projects favoured by the Government. Our facilitation of major development projects will not be driven by pre-election politics in the manner of the Government's `One Job' statement initiatives. We will instead work to lower business costs and provide tax incentives across the board, to the great benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1992, which was introduced into the House in August. Essentially, its purpose is to allow applicants for the development allowance to elect to aggregate two or more joint venture projects or specified projects and bring expenditure incurred in the long term lease of certain new units of plant within the ambit of the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992, the principal Act, which was passed in this place some time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement of February this year&mdash;and I am pleased that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) referred to that document&mdash;contained an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the introduction of a development allowance for selected large scale investments would be included. In fact, it was given effect to and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 provided a vehicle for advancing that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's objective was to promote an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer benefits to our competitiveness in world markets. As has been indicated, this particular amendment goes a step further, in that the Government is concerned about providing assistance for industry, where necessary and deemed appropriate, so that the pace and process of economic recovery in this country can be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it most interesting that the honourable member for Curtin was somewhat critical of a number of issues associated with this Bill and, more importantly, across a range of different issues. For example, he talked about many of the investment projects which were mentioned as part of the infrastructure projects in the One Nation statement as being white elephants. I think he talked about the rail and the road proposals and so on. If it is a white elephant to improve the rail gauges so that freight can be moved around Australia without having to change trains and without delays being occasioned, I guess it is a white elephant. The micro-economic reforms to which the honourable member referred, particularly on the waterfront, have seen a reduction in manpower of 47 per cent and enormous improvements in turnaround times in comparison to what occurred in years gone by. Obviously, that is the white elephant that he is talking about. Maybe we need a few more of those sorts of white elephants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition parties always paint themselves as being the pro-business parties. They paint themselves as being the ones that are out there to help, although, in light of some of the comments that Opposition members have made about BHP and its managing director, the car industry and the people who are running it, and anyone else that disagrees with their policies, one starts to wonder whether that is still the case. When I went back and looked at some of the criticisms that had been levelled at the original legislation when it was introduced into this Parliament, I wondered why the Opposition chose to vote against it. I thought to myself, `Why, if this is a pro-business party or selection of parties, would it vote against measures which would give some impetus to investment and try to stimulate jobs and the economy?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On looking back, I found that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), in a press release dated 26 May 1992, indicated exactly why those opposite were against the legislation. Interestingly, they were not against the spirit of the legislation; they were against it because it did not go far enough. In fact, three things come to mind about this press release. First, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that those opposite opposed the legislation because the development allowance would discriminate against projects with a capital cost of less than $50m, so the $50m threshold we had was not good enough; secondly, he said that it would not be available for investment in plant and equipment in all areas of the economy; and, thirdly, he said that it did not apply to projects commenced prior to 31 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the reasons advanced by the shadow Treasurer as to why those opposite were opposing the legislation: not because they disagreed necessarily with the concept of industry assistance, but rather that it did not go far enough and did not cover all sectors of the economy. Yet this evening we have had the honourable member for Curtin arguing that governments should not pick winners. I find it very interesting that he would dare to contradict some of the suggestions made by the shadow Treasurer, but then again it seems that quite a few people on the other side of the House are doing that these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dispute the assertion that this Government is into a `picking winners' scenario. If one looks at the history of the assistance given to business generally by this Government, one sees that it has been applied across the board with equity and fairness. The changes that have been occasioned in things such as company tax rates have applied across the board, rather than picking winners and going into certain areas. If one looks at some of the other issues associated with taxation generally, one sees that they are applied across the board and not in specific areas. It is a hallmark of this Government that it is prepared, in an industry policy sense, to suggest that, if an industry of any nature is to survive in the Australian economy, to be internationally competitive and to have a domestic base it has to stand on its own two feet, it indeed has to be internationally competitive, and it has to have all the things going for it which the honourable member for Curtin remarked upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was somewhat strange that the honourable member for Curtin, in the course of his contribution, said that government had no place in industry policy and that the Government should not target any specific industries for assistance under any circumstances. I represent the south coast and the industrial cities of Wollongong and Port Kembla. If it had not been for this Government intervening in 1983 and bringing down the steel industry plan, we would not have a steel industry in this country. If it had not been for this Government, through Senator Button bringing down the car plan, we would not have a car industry in this country. What will happen if the zero tariff proposals of the Opposition are imposed, if it ever comes to government? That prediction will come true, anyway. We have already heard what the car companies have to say about that. That analysis, which appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week, underlines that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it was not for the TCF plan of this Government, with specific assistance measures put in place to ease the burden of becoming a more competitive industry, we would not have any TCF industries in this country. So it is nonsense to say that particular areas of assistance should not be forthcoming from government and that government does not have a role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it a little laughable when the honourable member said that business could learn from entrepreneurs. He did qualify it by saying that one would not like to learn a great deal from some of those in the 1980s, and I could not agree with him more. But it is a view&mdash;and one which is widely shared on this side of House&mdash;that industry and government have a role to play&mdash;a cooperative role, as we have always sought. I think this legislation takes us towards that level of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did find it a little disturbing that criticism was levelled at the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Brereton), firstly for having introduced this legislation and, secondly, for some of the comments that he made in debate in respect of other aspects of his portfolio responsibilities. It does not matter whether a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister introduces legislation on behalf of the Treasurer or any other Minister. What is important is the content of that legislation. But to say that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has no level of expertise in terms of major infrastructure projects and does not have anything to contribute was a little unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this has now been proven in New South Wales. His tenure as Minister for Public Works, with the development of Darling Harbour and his vision for a new tunnel under Sydney Harbour, has clearly demonstrated that he had not only a knowledge but also a thorough understanding of infrastructure needs for a major metropolitan area such as Sydney. Many people, not only Australians but tourists from all over the world, are reaping benefits from it now. It is amazing, is it not? At the time there were so many critics of his endeavours with the Darling Harbour project, but now I do not think one would find too many around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another thing that I found interesting, in a general sense, about the comments by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to the One Nation statement and the infrastructure spending as was announced and as has now come forward in this legislation. If he took the opportunity to read the newspapers from New South Wales today, he would find that his colleague from New South Wales, the Premier, Mr John Fahey, and the Treasurer, did exactly the same thing yesterday in the State Budget. They brought down a Budget which contained a massive infrastructure stimulatory effect, for the simple reason that governments, whether it be us or the other side, have a legitimate role to play in stimulating the economy. Interestingly, the State Government's Budget did not offer much in relation to health&mdash;it did not have much else of much worth in terms of looking after social issues&mdash;but, in terms of trying to put people into employment, it built on the lead given by this Government. To that extent, I suppose, we should give thanks for small mercies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that legislation such as this be approved. It is important that it go through so that individual projects and joint venture projects in areas such as mining and other developments right around Australia can receive some assistance, provided they meet the strict criteria and guidelines laid down in this legislation. Clearly, it is not a matter of simply saying that an almost unviable or almost viable project will or will not get up for want of some assistance. That is not it at all. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions&mdash;and certainly at a major dinner in Sydney&mdash;that if projects are not viable governments cannot be expected to give them handouts to make them such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation we have clearly identified the fact that criteria have to be met, but we have taken a sensible approach as well. We are saying that industry assistance, in certain forms, is necessary and desirable and, from what I have seen, some of the major peak employer organisations and others believe that it is not too bad at all. With those brief comments, I commend this legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill which is before the House this evening is nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Australian Labor Party Government to be seen on paper to be assisting business investment. In fact, it does no such thing. Whilst this Government dallies, major investors are leaving our shores in droves. Take, for example, Watties brand baked beans. My good friend and colleague from Queensland the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) well knows the Watties company and its brand of baked beans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Watties, a food processor, sources its navy beans from Kingaroy in Queensland. However, the beans then hightail it out of Kingaroy and go across the Tasman to New Zealand where they are processed, given a quick injection of tomato sauce, promptly canned and shipped back to the supermarket shelves of Australia. Watties has concluded that the cost of producing its baked beans in Australia is too great. The spirit of this Bill will not encourage Watties to process Australian-grown food products in Australia for consumption in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there are countless cases similar to the Watties baked beans scenario. This Government has been the great architect of missed opportunities and job losses. In fact, job exportation is one of the Government's greatest growth industries. Testimony to this fact is our double digit unemployment level. Business investment has dropped in 1991-92 for the third successive year by a massive 16.3 per cent and is forecast to remain negative in the forthcoming year. Private and corporate confidence has been crushed by high interest rates, accumulated debt, industrial relations inefficiencies and unreasonable government taxes and charges. If this Government were serious about investment in Australia it would abolish payroll tax, wholesale tax, fuel excise tax and cut personal income tax. But quite clearly it is not serious about seeing investment prosper in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must put the Budget in order. Ask any Australian housewife when she has a budget to do and she will say that she has to keep the budget in order to keep the family together. The Government then has to bring down real interest rates and cut business costs through micro-economic reform and industrial relations reform. Instead, the Government recently handed down a $13.4 billion Budget deficit&mdash;a clear indication that it has had to step in where the private sector fears to tread while this Government has the treasury bench. The private sector fears to tread because it is offered no long term reliable industry policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill has come about as a result of constraints and inefficiencies in the principal Act. The principal Act provided for the establishment of the Development Allowance Authority which determines the eligibility of projects with a gross capital cost of $50m or more. Furthermore, the development allowance provides a deduction equal to 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure in the first year that the plant is used or installed ready for use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, an applicant has to meet certain arbitrary qualifying criteria, including an industrial relations arrangement which promotes the achievement of world best practice. I am not quite sure how we will get that under this Government. This requirement is waived for the first round of applicants who apply before the end of 1992.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point on its own raises serious contention within industry. The managing director of North Broken Hill Peko Ltd, Mr Peter Wade, argued that this exemption defeated the whole purpose of the legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why should we have one set of rules for a project which starts this year, and another for the next?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wade said that world best industrial practice in the mining industry may be to have no union, rather than single union coverage as proposed by the Government's guidelines for the allowance. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't mean to be facetious but it's almost an impossible series of situations to measure up to.</PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the nation's major investors talking. It is not the Opposition; this is a major investor who wants to invest in this nation. Lo and behold, business leaders require long term reliable policies, not ad hoc, one-off government wonders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed the principal Act on the grounds of the concerns I have raised, alongside the fact that the $50m threshold discriminated against smaller investors. Now, a mere four months after the establishment of the Development Allowance Authority, the Government is proposing amendments. It is back in the House with an amendment to this Bill. This further confirms the incompetence of the Government. It could not get it right. Had it taken the advice of the coalition parties in the first place, this debate this afternoon would not have been necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government amendments are designed to overcome the $50m threshold and blatantly serve to maximise the number of companies which are eligible for the development allowance prior to the Federal election. This is a desperate government in its death throes. I think the most desperate person is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;Mr Desperado himself&mdash;who this time last year was doing desperate deals on the back bench to secure the prime ministership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At best, the Government's development allowance has been described by industry as pretty modest. A spokesman for MIM Ltd, Mr Colin Myers, said that it was not the sort of benefit that would make the difference between projects commencing or not. Further concerns raised by industry related to the unnecessarily complex guidelines. The very modest benefit that such an allowance would provide to industry must be contrasted with the coalition's Fightback program, which provides $20 billion in tax relief for businesses, which will encourage investment and create jobs. Most important of all, it will be a benefit which will flow through to all businesses, whether they are large or small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document gives a pledge to review the business tax arrangements with a view to ensuring that sustainable, non-discriminatory incentives are available in order to encourage investment in the latest technology and ensuring that Australian workers have access to plant and equipment to produce output which matches the best in the world. In order to fulfil this commitment, a panel of leading businessmen and taxation experts has been established to advise the coalition on the arrangements it should implement when it comes to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition policy does not discriminate against investors with less than $50m to spend. Let us take, for example, the North Coast Regional Meat Co-operative based in Casino, New South Wales. That meatworks is the largest single employer north of Newcastle. The co-operative, which is also the largest integrated meatworks in Australia, would save $3.32m in government taxes and charges under a coalition government. Taxes and government charges exceeded net profit for the co-operative by nearly $1m, representing an unequivocal condemnation of the present Government's taxation regime. The Government's policy is stunting regional development, growth and employment. </PARA>

Furthermore, the meatworkers at the Casino co-operative would receive an extra $73 in their pay packets per week under a coalition government. That is $73 more that those workers will take home to their families in their pay packets. The coalition policies are designed to restore incentive, opportunity and reward to the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Mount Isa Mines Holdings Ltd annual report to shareholders gave a further unequivocal condemnation of the present Government's taxation regime. Taxes and government imposts on the MIM group in 1990-91 greatly exceeded net profit. Sales tax alone accounted for a massive $5m, fuel excise a further $5.5m, and payroll tax an exorbitant $19 1/2m. The total cost, $30m, represents the potential savings that Mount Isa Mines Holdings would make under a Liberal-National Party government. This $30m that the Mount Isa Mines company would save equates to more regional employment, growth and development. It is money that it will have to spend and it will decide where it spends and invests it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill is designed to amend the Development Allowance Authority Act, which was carried by both Houses in the Autumn sittings. It aims to introduce a greater degree of flexibility into the scheme by enabling new projects to aggregate, together with the upgrading and expansion of existing projects, subject to those new projects being vertically integrated with the existing projects, and to improve the flexibility to combine plant or equipment acquired through either lease or purchase to meet the $50m test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is designed to provide a greater degree of flexibility. I gather that Opposition members do not have a great problem with that. They certainly do not like the overall approach represented by the original Act but, as I understand it, they have not expressed opposition to these amendments, except to the extent that they seem to be saying that, if the amendments enable more projects to qualify, that represents a higher level of government intervention in investment decisions. They say they are against that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure and the principal Act are part of a package of measures set out in the One Nation statement designed to improve this country's economic fortunes. Part of that package was a major boost to the spending on public infrastructure. I note that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was critical of that. I think that criticism is misplaced. I think there is a growing body of evidence in the international economic literature that under-investment in public infrastructure is a false economy and exacts a significant toll in terms of overall growth in economic productivity. I think those criticisms of investment in public infrastructure are misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the criticisms that have been mounted of this sort of approach to provide an incentive for an acceleration of investment by the private sector and the introduction of best practice is also misplaced. The honourable member for Curtin made reference to this being an approach involving picking winners. I do not think that is a reasonable description. We are not identifying particular industry sectors. We are not purporting to make judgments as to the overall prospects of major investment projects. We are doing something far more limited: we are applying a competitiveness test to see whether we have best practice, on a world standard, in labour management relations and to see whether we have efficient industries involved in the provision of inputs. It is much more limited than some generalised attempt to pick winners. I think that characterisation is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the overall comments the honourable member for Curtin made about government intervention in industry policy were also wrong. Economies that have been highly successful in developing highly productive and efficient economies have not been content to allow the market to dictate all investment decisions without any involvement by government. What we are seeking to do is, on the one hand, to secure the bringing forward of major investment decisions, but also, in the process, to capitalise some change in overall culture and practice in Australian industry. As a way of doing that, I think this is a pretty reasonable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allowance is targeted towards the stimulation of investment in large projects which can satisfy the DAA that they are world competitive and that the environment within which they operate is also competitive. Projects which are heavily assisted are specifically excluded from eligibility. That reflects the approach of this Government of moving to a lower tariff environment and a less protected environment than the one we have now, albeit not going to the zero or negligible protection levels favoured by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, each applicant must satisfy the DAA that the project does not have a nominal or effective rate of assistance&mdash;taking the lower figure&mdash;exceeding 10 per cent. These measures of assistance will be calculated separately for each project, taking into account all assistance received by the project from all levels of government in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Industry Commission to calculate assistance. There are a number of key dates in the legislation, the most immediately pressing of which is 1 January 1993, before which date all applications must have been received by the DAA if they are to be considered. I hope that point clears up the degree of confusion that might exist in the industry about the need for individual projects to satisfy that test in respect of not being heavily protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the twenty-fifth occasion on which I have been in this Parliament when we have debated a Budget. On the first night I was a member of this Parliament William McMahon brought in the 1967 Budget. For the sake of memory I went back and read that speech a few weeks ago. One has to say that the activities of this Parliament have changed quite considerably during that period. For instance, the Budget mentioned a massive increase in health expenditure at that time of $35m that year. It did not mention education because the Commonwealth had no role in education, other than a couple of the 1950 bribes which were still in continuance&mdash;science blocks and school libraries&mdash;which won Menzies an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that at that time, 18 years after the conservative parties had come into office, one of the major promises they had made in 1949 and fulfilled in 1950 to introduce child endowment for the first child had just seen its first change. The Government changed the five shillings to 50c, with the change to decimal currency, but there was never a change in the amount of money. I make those points because I think it is important that the change that has taken place over a relatively short period in our history in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States be emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972 the Commonwealth largely remained an adjunct to the community in Australia rather than part of it. Its activities were peripheral to the day-to-day life of ordinary Australians. It is significant that the major issues Gough Whitlam put forward when he was the Leader of the Opposition were things such as sewering the suburbs. I can imagine some of our founding fathers turning in their graves at the thought. There were 600,000 Australians who had been let down by State governments, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, living in half and full houses without such basic community amenities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of that has changed but so has the Commonwealth itself. This Parliament now controls and is responsible for&mdash;and, no matter what the Opposition may like to think, is going to stay responsible for&mdash;the major activities of communities in Australia. The attempts to withdraw from that are the most dangerous aspects of the Opposition's policies today. We have gone from the period where William McMahon stood up at the table in the old House with galleries full of pensioners and told them that there was no money in the Budget for a rise in pensions this year. I am sure the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) will remember that. He will also remember that a person whom I am sure he supported at the time, John Gorton, was the Prime Minister. When William McMahon became Prime Minister, the first thing he did was give them 50c. It was the only highlight of his first speech as Prime Minister. </PARA>

We still use the forms, with more members and less time, that we used in 1900. We adopted the Westminster system. We have not changed it to meet Australians' needs; we have not changed it at all. We still debate everything in the chamber, which is unnecessary. Basically, because of that, we have abdicated our responsibility as a House of Parliament to look at legislation.

But not one of them was prepared to make one single alteration to the procedures to facilitate any change. I have to say Prime Ministers are the worst. They are all the same, if I might say so. It does not matter where they come from. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has advocated change in this Parliament but the only change he has significantly put forward is televising Parliament.

I think he was the first leader it has thrown out in living memory. It then went to a leader who lost his seat, which does not say much for his electoral standing, and now we have the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) who said the other day that the GST can be avoided if one grows vegetables. That cannot be done unless one eats them all because, under the GST, barter is involved. If there are two pensioners, and one grows cabbages and has more than he can eat, if he hands them over the fence to his neighbour and gets a few lemons, they both have to put in a tax form because that is barter trade. </PARA>

Hidden taxes are the ones that people are not told about and do not know about. I will go back to one of our former leaders and the sorts of tax promises we have heard, and will continue to hear, from those who sit opposite. In 1975, Malcolm Fraser had just assumed leadership of the Liberal Party. Those opposite have gone so far to the right now that they claim he is a Labor member and a leftie, but I can assure them that we still look upon him as extreme right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in the 1977 election campaign we had the offer of a handful of dollars. What was that all about? The conservative parties in this House had legislated before the election to index the tax brackets. They fulfilled Malcolm's promise after the Budget, during the tax year, to apply for the next tax year. Then the Australian Taxation Office spent half a million dollars on overtime, answering telephones because the Liberal ads told people to ring up the Tax Office and find out what the tax savings would be. Good stuff&mdash;no more taxation by stealth!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened when we came back in 1978? The legislation was repealed. Tax brackets became the name of the game and that is how every one of the Budgets was financed. By the end of that period taxation by stealth was a long forgotten thing. Honourable members may remember that in that election we promised to abolish payroll tax and we were howled down about people paying personal income tax. What had we done? We had passed a Bill which we had no intention of ever allowing to operate. It was a fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where we were in the tax field at the end of that period. If people wanted to avoid tax they bought a submarine and sat it on the floor at the bottom of the harbour. Some of us still have a copy of the documents that passed between the Commissioner of Taxation and the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), asking the Treasurer to bring in legislation. It includes some of the minutes of Liberal Party committees. The Liberal Party was desperately trying to stall any action. For two years the Commissioner wrote letters talking about the bleeding of the tax system by the most blatant cheating that had ever gone on in this country&mdash;$1 billion worth of tax. The report on the straw companies is very thick. There are letters from the Commissioner of Taxation pleading with the then Treasurer and the Fraser Government to fix up the tax legislation so that it could be applied and the tax system could become honest. </PARA>

The coalition governments had borrowed in every Budget to finance their affairs. They had not brought in a balanced Budget since 1951 in the wool boom. It would have been pretty hard not to have balanced the Budget that year. As a matter of fact, if the government had not balanced the Budget that year, it would have needed an investigation to see how much it had taken out for itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring forward a ludicrous situation that makes a sham of the rhetoric we hear in this place from many honourable members who express concern about the maintenance of efficient Australian industry. It was Australia's CSIRO that led the world in developing technology known as counter current extraction which could obtain an extract from citrus fruit peel that would otherwise have gone to waste. Considerable public funds went into the research and development of this, and into subsequent efforts to commercialise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority will be aware that it is possible, with CCE, to extract from that part of the citrus fruit known as peel a peel extract. That product, known as diffusion extracted juice, closely resembles the juice which is extracted from the flesh of the fruit. In fact, the NFA's predecessor came to the view that orange peel extract, as it was decided to call it, was not only a wholesome and nutritious product but also varied little from orange juice in chemical and nutritional make-up. Nevertheless, for reasons arising from no more than perceptions of customer opinion, the NFA's predecessor came to the view that the products made from the endocarp only, or from the exocarp and mesocarp only, were different, so different that in terms of food regulation one was juice and the other was not for purposes of use in fruit drinks and cordials. There is no evidence in the official minutes of the NFA's predecessor as to the views or opinions of consumers on this matter, although some opinions as to what they might be are recorded. There is also no evidence that the NFA's predecessor ever sought such views or commissioned any surveys on its own account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFA's predecessor considered the effects of mixing orange peel extract and orange juice in fruit drinks, cordials and soft drinks. On the one hand it was established that, because the chemical composition of both products was very similar, the end product was indistinguishable from orange juice. On the other hand, however, it was apparently felt that such mixing would be adulteration and therefore deceptive. It was, however, a deception so undetectable that there was no Australian laboratory test capable of finding it. In an effort to detect the undetectable, the very same CSIRO which developed the original technology has now been asked to develop an effective test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of its deliberations, the NFA's predecessor considered the situation of limes. It appears that, because lime juice has traditionally been made from the whole fruit, it was decided that lime juice should be exempted from the ban that applies to all other citrus peel extract. It is recognised that lime juice has been made for a long time before that, peel and all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the public has been no more aware or unaware of this practice in the case of that fruit, whether from limes or from any other citrus. Such adulteration or deception as may be thought to arise is at best theoretical. It is based on a view of consumers interested in how a product was produced, rather than what it is. At the same time, the Australian citrus industry makes the present application for the authorisation of the use of fruit juice peel in fruit drinks and related products and not for its inclusion in fruit juice. As well, the proposal is that fruit peel juice should be declared as an ingredient on the label. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The above brief account of what is admittedly a complex and technical matter shows that the decision taken late last year, although not yet put into effect, patently requires reconsideration. Industry statistics indicate that 32,816,000 litres of single strength juice, or 64,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, will have to be found to replace citrus peel juice in products such as cordial, soft drinks and fruit drinks if the intended amendment comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insufficient conventional extracted fruit juice is available to fill this gap, and the deficit will be required to be obtained from imports, adversely affecting our balance of payments. I make the point to the House that these imports, possibly using the CSIRO's techniques using the whole fruit, will be competing against our own&mdash;a matter of high farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to the Food Standards Code is supported by the Australian Citrus Industry Council, which includes the Australian Fruit Juice Association, the Australian Citrus Processors Association and the Australian Citrus Growers Federation. It is also supported by the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Australian Softdrink Manufacturers Association and Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd.

Mr Hoskins made a comment in his article to dairy farmers and shareholders of Norco about the dairy industry changes. In particular, in regard to the changes that were instituted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), Mr Hoskins made the following comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan does respond to earlier recommendations of the Industries Commission, but the strategies to be implemented are far different to the proposals put forward in the I.C. Report. As a result, the future of the Australian Dairy Industry has much greater clarity and is certainly far more secure than it would have been if the I.C. proposals had been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hoskins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision of the Government should be welcomed by all of us in the industry in N.S.W. It will ensure a strong and highly efficient industry and continue to bring economic benefits to many rural cities, towns and communities throughout Australia. These proposals will drive value-adding of dairy products on the export market as well as the domestic market, and dairy companies such as Norco Co-operative, that are strongly involved in value-adding, will be well placed for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, I believe that this announcement of our future arrangements is a very positive one and gives a much more effective position than I felt would be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>He paid tribute to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry leaders agree that Mr. Crean deserves recognition for his support to an industry which is extremely efficient, and which is of major economic importance to this nation. From the industry standpoint however, special recognition. . . must go to Mr. Pat Rowley who has worked tirelessly to drive industry into developing proposals for the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I would very much like to point out to the dairy farmers on the north coast certain aspects of the impact of the GST. I make reference to an article in the journal of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science which was published in May 1992. The article I am referring to was written by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd). In particular, I point to the financial burden that the GST will place on this industry, using the very figures that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has actually published&mdash;so I guess they must be right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example that the Deputy Leader uses is a dairy farm which produces something like 380,000 litres of milk a year. On his own figures, that particular dairy farm would be sending to the Taxation Commissioner, if the coalition were ever to introduce a GST, in excess of $6,000 just in goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular dairy farm would probably not be a good example for north coast dairy farmers, because of some of the deductions that would be allowed. In any farming business, the deductions allowed are those which the farmer would outlay and  which would have a GST on them. Whether this particular example is high or low, does not stop the farmer paying a GST. </PARA>

If the deductions were low, he would still be paying a GST on his profit, because the GST that he pays out comes in on the income that he receives. He gets a rebate on his deductions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am simply pointing out to those opposite, to the dairy farmers and to farm businesses of Australia, is that on the profit that he makes he will be paying a GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also point out that this GST is paid to the Commissioner of Taxation before he can go to his accountant and take into account other things, such as wages that he may pay to someone else, or any other deductions such as depreciation and so forth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With Australia's recession being the most severe since the 1930s, there has been a re-emergence of a protectionist sentiment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;the then Treasurer&mdash;said in this House on 15 May 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia once and for all gets out of the shocking period when we believed we could take our benefits and our living standards from a tariff wall.

<PARA>These are the clear statements of Prime Minister Keating. The interventionists cannot give Australia an alternative model to free trade. Returning to the bad old days of high protection in Australia would invite a siege political mentality, and a society that has such a deep-seated inferiority complex about its ability to compete on the world market that it had to again put up the artificial barriers to competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have examined some of the shifts in Victoria in employment patterns over the last three years. Clothing and footwear industries employed 39,500 in May 1989. Three years later, that figure had dropped to 31,200. The Industry Commission estimates that the average effective rate of assistance to this sector in June 1989 was 171 per cent. By June 1991, the effective rate of assistance had increased to 176 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment in the motor vehicle and parts sector had declined from 48,800 in 1989 to 37,000 in 1992, whereas there was a fall in effective protection levels from 72 per cent to 60 per cent. Yet the unprotected motor trades sector now only employs 57,000 compared with 62,000 two years ago. Job losses in the unprotected construction industry have hit even harder. There are now only 121,000 employees in the construction industry in Victoria, as against 160,000 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If job losses are largely the fault of tariff reductions, why has the construction industry suffered so heinously and so badly. The boom and bust mentality of the 1980s under the Victorian Labor Government ensured that, when the bust hit Victoria, jobs totally unrelated to tariff walls were lost. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some occupations in Victoria have actually recorded increases in employment over the last three years. The glass sector, for instance, increased employment from 2,400 to 3,100. It is protected to a level of only one per cent. Employment rose in the furniture and mattresses industries from 15,500 to 18,400&mdash;a gain of 20 per cent. Those industries operate with protection levels of between one and 4 per cent. They managed to increase employment during a recession, and with heightened import competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Printing and allied trades increased from 24,000 to 32,800 over the last three years. They have high levels of import competition. Breads, cakes, and biscuit manufacturing increased from 9,400 to 11,500. This sector has no effective protection. Either the recession or a lack of capital investment over the past 40 years are the most important factors in any job losses, rather than any lowering of tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister does not tell us about the comments released in the 1991-92 annual report of the Automotive Industry Authority into the car industry, which reads:</PARA>

A Hewson Government will reduce industry's costs through the Fightback program, whilst not deviating from the very necessary tariff reductions over the next eight years.

They are into that voodoo money funny stuff and conspiracies under the beds; they are similar to those poor clowns in those southern states in 1861.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to raising the matter I wanted to raise in the adjournment debate, I just want to make a comment or two about the remarks made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), particularly with reference to the goods and services tax which applies to the dairy industry. I point out to the honourable member for Richmond, and anyone else who may be listening or who may care to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, that regardless of which industry people are in, whether it is a secondary industry or a primary industry, there is no such thing as a goods and services tax that applies to the industry. In fact, whether the industry makes a profit or a loss, any goods and services tax incurred is refunded to the industry. That is a fundamental rule that cannot be escaped and will undo much of what the honourable member for Richmond was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have been involved in a debate that somewhat focused on subsidies, particularly the subsidies that we see flowing, as a result of EEP, into what are traditional markets for Australian wheat. It is true that Australian primary producers only survive now by using the best techniques they have available to them. In fact, the Kinsey report into agriculture in South Australia asked the very fundamental question: why is it that the best sheep graziers in the Pinnaroo area of South Australia achieve a lambing rate of 98 per cent, when the average lambing rate is only 68 per cent? They discovered that, for very little additional input, it is possible for a farmer to lift the lambing rate from 68 per cent to 98 per cent and make a real contribution to Australia's export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use that as a backdrop to my remarks tonight because I want to focus the attention of the House on one primary industry which, with very little additional input, has a dramatic opportunity to raise its productivity base, and that is the chicken industry in South Australia. One of the companies in my electorate, Imloson Pty Ltd, which runs a hatchery at Bethel just north of Gawler, had sought permission from AQIS to import chickens from a European destination&mdash;Isabrown chickens. AQIS gave Imloson permission on the condition that it accepted a secondary quarantine period for these imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imloson went ahead with the import. It brought these Isabrown eggs in and went ahead with the hatching program. Meanwhile, unknown to Imloson, AQIS had also commissioned a Dr Snowdon to check out the whole quarantine procedure that applied to the chicken industry. Dr Snowdon handed down a report which indicated that EDS, the egg drop syndrome&mdash;the one thing that AQIS would be most nervous about with the import of Isabrown chickens&mdash;was no longer, in Dr Snowdon's assessment, something that Australia should be concerned about on an import basis, particularly as EDS was already present in Australia and therefore did not pose any greater threat to the Australian chicken industry. Imloson, having brought in the Isabrown chickens and holding them in quarantine, principally because of the perceived earlier EDS threat, sought permission from AQIS, first, to move the birds to an alternative sight&mdash;and permission was granted&mdash;and, secondly, to lift this quarantine protocol as EDS was no longer seen to be a problem. AQIS refused to lift this protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The picture becomes even more complicated when we discover that, because of the shortage of egg pulp in Australia, there is a proposal to import egg pulp from New Zealand, and under discussion paper CQO(A) 112/92 it has been agreed that EDS is not of quarantine significance. What I want to know is why it is that AQIS still insists on Imloson meeting all of the quarantine protocols that were originally laid down, even though AQIS clearly no longer saw EDS as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These quarantine protocols are costing Imloson thousands of dollars. That is no exaggeration. There are opportunities for Imloson to move into additional job creation if they could free the birds currently held under protocol, since they no longer pose a threat to the chicken industry. Imloson has not been critical of AQIS. It suspects that AQIS is already being lobbied by its major competitors to oblige AQIS to stand by the protocols. But the fact remains that what could be an even more efficient industry is being frustrated by these present AQIS regulations which, under the eye of AQIS, have already been seen as being excessive. The import of egg pulp and the recommendations made in Dr Snowdon's report would indicate that there is no reason why EDS should continue to be a quarantine problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to express concern at events that have transpired in my home State, where the Speaker of the Tasmanian Parliament has foreshadowed draconian bans on the right of the public to attend the Tasmanian Parliament. What has occurred is that, in response to a number of demonstrations from building workers who are facing involuntary retrenchments, the Speaker has closed the galleries and said that for substantial periods&mdash;for at least a full day after any clearing of the gallery&mdash;the public will not be admitted to the Speaker's galleries to witness the debates in the State Parliament. Not merely those who have taken part in demonstrations have been excluded, but any member of the public will be excluded unless they have a prearranged appointment with a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker's lockout at the Parliament shows a total contempt for the basic rights of all Tasmanians and follows a downward spiral by the State Government, which has seen events move towards greater polarisation of the society. Since the Liberals came to government in Tasmania, we have seen guard dogs and hired muscle used during the APPM dispute, legislation to stop people demonstrating on Crown land, picketers arrested at the Hobart waterfront and members of the public now being effectively locked out of their own Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, despite many disruptions that have occurred in this and other State parliaments, this is the only time the people of Australia have ever been precluded from attending, over a substantial period, a State or Commonwealth parliament. I understand from my research of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, the only time there has been a substantial exclusion of the public for any period at all was during wartime in the 1920s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, the First World War. The only defence that has thus far been made of the decision of the Tasmanian Government to exclude the public from attendance at the Parliament has come from Michael Hodgman, QC, now a State member. I do not normally descend to a cheap shot at my predecessor. He did have, at one stage, a very substantial reputation as a man who might make a mark on the national scene. But, over time, I think his lack of self-respect for the issues that he pursued led him to become a caricature of his former self.</PARA></TALK.START>

A quick perusal of the record, as disclosed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, indicates that is simply not the case.
