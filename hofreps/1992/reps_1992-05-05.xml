<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the Treasury has today provided information to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that the superannuation guarantee levy would destroy 45,000 jobs in the first two years and 100,000 jobs after five years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of what the Treasury has put to the Senate today. I would doubt very much that that would be a Treasury view. I make it quite clear to the Opposition that this country should take seriously the need to develop a pool of national savings and to provide off budget for the demographic shift in the population which is going to occur when the baby boom generation turns 65. If that is not done now, it will never be done. That is why there has to be a policy not only of a decent retirement income position and at the same time being able to build upon the building block of our retirement age system, the age pension, and additions to the age pension&mdash;that is, levels of retirement income in excess of the age pension through private provision with superannuation&mdash;but, on top of that, building a pool of national savings as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You mean `Flexiback'. I would have thought that the Opposition would have had enough sense to see that, for the first time ever under the accord processes, this Government has encouraged the organised work force to agree to take 10 per cent of its income as savings rather than as cash. It has never been done before; it has never been achieved before. The importance of that acceptance by the trade unions' membership will be a significant factor in Australia's investment future in terms of savings and, in terms of living standards, a better standard of living in retirement. Rather than rabbiting on again with ideological obsessions about the power of trade unions and about their control over investment funds and all of the other phobias, which this phobia-ridden crowd opposite have, what they should do is basically support the Government and try to see the spread of occupational superannuation throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask: has his attention been drawn to an article in last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `Seal of approval for the goods tax'? Can the Treasurer advise the House as to what the OECD's report on Australia said about indirect tax reform?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2341" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I also listened as attentively as I could to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday in a debate he inspired on the OECD's report, in which he claimed that this report gave clear and unequivocal support to the introduction of a new consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, we are probably in a position where the Deputy Leader did not bother to read what was put in front of him or, if he did, he certainly did not understand it, because that is not what the OECD report said. The OECD report listed the pros and the cons of a new consumption tax. Amongst the reservations which were listed were `the risks involved for macro-economic management, the disruption to business and the difficulties of adequately compensating households for the price effects of GST'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to and particularly emphasise this area of risk to macro-economic management. The Minister for Finance, in a statement on 16 December last year, when he produced the Treasury and Tax Office costings of the revenue side of the Opposition's package, stressed that in the second year of the Opposition's proposed three-year program there would be a major relaxation of Budget policy. It is perfectly appropriate to have a relaxation of Budget policy or fiscal policy in circumstances where you are trying to stimulate growth in the economy but, in the middle year in which it is proposed that this relaxation should occur, the economy would already be growing fairly robustly in response to the initiatives which this Government has taken and which will continue in the course of the next couple of years. At that time my colleague said that if you were to provide this stimulus at that point, in the 1994-95 year, then this would cause the monetary authorities to have to respond with high interest rates in order to deal with this extra stimulus coming from the package. But I am advised that the budgetary relaxation that my colleague was referring to is much worse than was thought at the time that he made the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised by the Treasury and the Tax Office that there was an error in the calculation made at that time, and I will explain what that error was. The coalition proposed to introduce its new tax on 1 October 1994. In the arithmetic of Fightback the coalition assumed that there would be nine months of the new tax collected during that financial year. The Tax Office and the Treasury took this at face value but, although the tax may be in operation for nine months, the Tax Office would not collect nine months worth of revenue. This is for the reason that the Opposition has been running around telling businesses that they would not have to pay the tax immediately. In fact, the Opposition says that the largest businesses in Australia would be required to submit GST returns each month and pay the tax on or before the end of the following month; businesses with current turnovers below $24m would be required to submit their returns every two months and pay the tax on or before the end of the month following that; and the smallest businesses would be able to submit GST returns on a six monthly basis and hand over the tax within a month after the end of that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be a major delay in the collection of GST which would impact quite significantly on that first year of its operation. The Opposition is saying that this includes great benefits for business, ignoring the fact that any alleged benefit for taxpayers becomes a cash flow problem for the Tax Office. So, at the absolute minimum, these lags in the collection of this new tax would mean that we would not see the generation of nine months worth of revenue, but rather no more than eight months revenue and probably less than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on the basis of the Liberals' own calculation, this would see a reduction in the collections which they assume of $2.263 billion&mdash;another $2.2 billion reduction in the estimated revenue. The calculation that has been made has been very generous, and I want to make one further qualification just to err on the side of fairness as far as the Opposition is concerned. In collecting less GST, those opposite would, although they have not realised it themselves&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister has continued, throughout his five minutes of answering a single question, to deal with matters that, in fact, are outside his responsibility. But I think five minutes is enough. I would ask that you, Mr Speaker, follow the precedent set so often in this place and ask the Minister to bring his answer to a conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, the collections of wholesale sales tax would be rather larger than estimated in Fightback. So the actual hole in the first year of the operation of the GST is $1 1/2 billion dollars. Of course, this has enormous consequences for the management of the economy at the time. It is an enormous relaxation of fiscal policy during that year and it would have implications for the monetary authorities whom the Opposition would instruct to act totally autonomously in the face of this budgetary relaxation. So the suggestion that there would be a tightening of monetary policy is even a more acute problem for the Opposition as a result of this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my duty from time to time to draw attention to the erroneous arithmetic of the Leader of the Opposition. Once again, I find myself in that position today. As a result of this $1 1/2 billion extra hole in Fightback, we now see the credibility gap expanding to $5 1/2 billion. It is a $5 1/2 billion hole coming from a person who prides himself on his own particular learning. What the Leader of the Opposition has done to arithmetic is what the former Premier of Queensland used to do to the English language.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The demonstrable distortion and mistruth in that statement is simply that the people the Leader of the Opposition targets as being opponents of the legislation voted for it here in the House of Representatives. It passed the House of Representatives and went to the Senate. I have no greater authority than the Tasmanian Liberal Minister for Forests who said that he was pleased that the Government agreed to change the title of the Bill and could now see no reason why the legislation should not be passed. That was a simple thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was there on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to be voted on, passed into legislation and proclaimed. It would have provided resource security for the regions of importance in terms of major forest product developments. You voted it down because you believe that you can do cynical things in here and go and do a cheap doorstop interview or give a quick kerbside radio interview and that people will confuse your position on these things. The fact is that you have been exposed for the opportunists that you are. You sought simply to embarrass the Government, to deny the legislation, but, in doing so, you have hurt this industry seriously and, as I said before, wilfully. You have hurt particularly those regions of New South Wales and Tasmania where resource security was an important factor in the development of large pulp mills.</PARA>

He is up with crocodile tears but the moment you put up any test for him that is in any way difficult to vote for, for example, large numbers of jobs in very significant industries, it goes down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I will be meeting with the canegrowers' representatives this afternoon and I understand that they have already met this morning with the honourable member for Hinkler whom I have asked to chair an industry committee to develop an industry strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for establishing this committee is that the canegrowers are but one dimension of the sugar industry, an important dimension, granted. But what we really need to do is to tackle the refiners and the millers as well as the manufacturers. This group will bring them together. Honourable members opposite as well as the canegrowers should have regard to the successful outcome in the dairy industry that has been applauded in rural sectors. It was achieved last week after I sat down over a number of months with the dairy industry to work out a plan for its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of the question, I am aware of suggestions made as recently as last week in this House of a so-called $8,000 benefit for canegrowers. This was made by the Leader of the National Party when he got up in the Parliament and claimed to have been misrepresented because I had not completed a quote in relation to an interview he had with Laurie Oakes. The bit that was left out was to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cane growers also directly and indirectly will have a benefit of about $8,000 per cane grower&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by inference, if the GST package is introduced. The reason I did not go on to quote that was that had I done so I would have been guilty of misrepresenting the truth. The fact of the matter is that that $8,000 figure simply does not stand up. It is a figure that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has worked out on the back of an envelope by taking the Treasury's estimate of aggregate savings to the whole of the agriculture sector and dividing it by the number of farmers. The problem is that the number of farmers is wrong by ABARE's own analysis. The ABARE survey excludes all farms below a $20,000 per year cash value output. In other words, to start with, it excludes about 30,000 to 40,000 farms, an additional one-third more than is used in his calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the figure that he divides into from the Treasury document does not include just farmers in the agriculture sector; it includes forestry, fisheries and hunting. Not only do we have a position in which the number of farms is wrong, but the figure itself in relation to the farm sector is also wrong. The $8,000 is an absolute fiction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again it comes to the point that, whenever the National Party gets itself into strife, it will say anything to extricate itself. The other point that ought to be noted is that the very Treasury document that the Deputy Leader of the National Party used to do the calculations, which his Leader has blindly followed, also says that 60 per cent of small businesses and farmers will be worse off. In addition, our own calculations suggest that, for every one per cent increase in inflation, the cost to the farm sector, not just to the canegrowers, will go up by $1,200 per farm. I tell you what: it is a great package!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that those opposite deliberately misrepresent this position? The reason is simple:  the coalition, and the National Party in particular, will do anything and say anything to preserve the coalition unity. They will do it at any cost because the National Party leadership has determined that its most effective means for winning government is to prop up the coalition at any cost. You have not been taken seriously by the Liberal Party. You were not included in the process of industry development that is contained in Fightback. For the benefit of anyone who needs a quote in terms of where the Liberal Party sees the National Party, the honourable member for Bennelong as recently as 4 May in an interview with Michelle Grattan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party has nowhere to go but be in coalition.</PARA>

They have got an idea from the way those opposite behave in all their policy areas where that $90m will be spent: it will be spent on the wealthiest at the expense of low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Opposition does not have a tax policy in relation to child-care that it is game to put out to the Australian community. As with its health care policy, it has great difficulty, day after day, year after year, in putting out a policy to the Australian people that they can see would benefit those on low and middle incomes&mdash;the ordinary Australian. It is not in a situation to do so. It is the same with the Opposition's health policy: it cannot cover the game and that is why it continues to avoid it, continues to obfuscate and say that it will not support the fee relief system and talks around tax rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to see where members of the Opposition are going to spend the money as do the people of Australia. Those opposite did not con them at the last election on child-care; they will not con them now. They cannot get away from that fact&mdash;as Senator Alston tried to get away from the fact yesterday in his press release when he quoted Treasury estimates&mdash;that Fightback will see a one-off rise in child-care fees of just 4.99 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is fooled by averages, not when it comes to the policies that come from the Opposition. The redistribution and the regressivity of Fightback is the total issue in this whole child-care package. People will not be fooled by your proposals. The sooner you bring out your child-care policies so that people who are now enjoying the genuine fee relief system, which is fair and generous to people who need it the most, can see the regressivity of your proposals, the better. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the truth will always cut straight through.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2354" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday's figures for dwelling approvals show an increase of almost 7 per cent in March 1992 and put beyond any doubt recovery in the housing sector. These favourable results have been brought about by an achievement of the highest level of affordability since September 1985. That improvement in affordability has come about for two reasons: firstly, that interest rates have fallen and many home purchasers can now obtain mortgages at rates around 9 per cent; and, secondly, and as importantly, the median price of first houses has fallen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home buyers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are benefiting not just from falling interest rates but also from lower house prices. On a national basis, the median price of a first house fell from $118,700 in December to $114,200 in the March quarter. That reflects increasing activity at the lower end of the market. Mr Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the medium home price reflected an increase in sales at the lower priced end of the market. Reductions in home loan rates have increased dramatically borrowing capacity enabling more lower income and first home buyers to purchase a home.</PARA>
<PARA>It is this question of affordability that is sustaining the recovery in terms of the housing market. It reflects availability of lower cost housing and that, in turn, reflects the emphasis that the Government has placed on Green Street, the Australian model code for residential development. We are increasingly seeing developed estates that reflect affordability as a prime concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will continue to work with the States to develop programs to reduce the cost of housing. Indeed, sustainability of recovery depends on sustaining affordability. But the difference with the Opposition is quite stark. This time when the news is good for home buyers and builders, the Opposition continues with its plan to increase house prices. The Parliament is now familiar with the fact that the Opposition would force up the cost of new houses by about $3,000 through the imposition of a GST. In addition, it would lift the costs of agents' and solicitors' fees and the cost of furnishing and renovations through the GST. These price hikes would wipe out the gains made by home buyers after the last six months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am very conscious of the specific matters that are to be raised in the Migration Amendment Bill and I will not allude to them. The issue I wish to raise is the Government's failure to maintain control of entry to Australia for permanent settlement. The specific matter that I wish to canvass relates to the way in which Chinese students in Australia have been accommodated, especially by this Government, not only by decisions taken by the former Prime Minister and his Government but compounded by further statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of honourable members opposite who constitute the Labor Party's immigration committee suggested to me that this matter ought to be raised at this time. The committee chairman, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), last night had the audacity to endorse the action of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in maintaining the integrity of Australia's immigration program, particularly the refugee component. The committee expressed concern that the integrity of the program was under public attack with calls for Cambodian boat people who have jumped the queue to be given residence in Australia, irrespective of the outcome of their applications for refugee status. The committee's statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residence in Australia should not be granted merely because of delays in the processing of their applications.</PARA>
<PARA>It states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . such attempts imperil the rights of legitimate refugees living in camps and other conditions of hardship overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These refugees are fleeing from persecution and the hope for resettlement for these people depends on the integrity of the refugee process and can be jeopardised by the lowering of standards.</PARA>
<PARA>When I read that comment, I said to myself, `Hear, hear! The honourable member and his committee have it right'. They are basic principles that are fundamental to immigration, as is the principle that the government of the day should have the right to determine who shall, or shall not, be able to enter Australia and settle permanently. Another fundamental principle is that, in selecting applicants for immigration, immigration policy will not discriminate against applicants on the basis of their race, religion or country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time those principles have been put to one side, flawed entry arrangements have occurred. The undermining of the integrity of our immigration process follows. It is the case that, when the Government abandoned that decision in relation to the 20,000 or so Chinese students who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, that situation arose. It was a decision that was wrong when the then Prime Minister made it, and it is wrong now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable members will know because I have emphasised it time and time again&mdash;and I might say it was emphasised also by the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray&mdash;that these matters should have been dealt with on the basis of individual people and not determined on class grounds. Individual merit should have been the basis upon which these matters were assessed. Senator Ray's remarks can be found in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of June 1989. A case by case determination of the claims of the students who were in Australia at that time should have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has been argued that so many were involved that it would not have been possible to do that. Yet we know that today we have many more than that number making claims for refugee status in Australia and seeking protection. The Government has to accommodate that. The Government is having to determine those claims. Most of the people who are here now making those claims would not be doing so were it not for the original decision. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not want to misrepresent the Minister in any way whatsoever, but it seemed very clear to me that the comment came from his direction. Regardless of who made the point, it was wrong. The fact is that many of those students who were here at that time were allowed to stay on, notwithstanding the fact that they had never been subjected to normal migration criteria and were never subjected to the health checks and character checks that we would expect would be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that many of the students were at that time illegal immigrants. Senator Ray revealed that up to 40 per cent had overstayed their visas at that time. It was not as if it was without notice. We know from freedom of information requests obtained by my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) that when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was Minister he warned the then Prime Minister in March 1988 in relation to this question. In a letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has for some time been aware of anecdotal evidence that some private overseas students, particularly those undertaking short-term <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>English language courses . . . are abusing the student program for their own advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data which had only recently become available supports that view.</PARA>
<PARA>He gave examples:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the end of January 1988, 28 percent of 1987 ELICOS student arrivals had not left Australia despite the expiry of their entry permits and are now overstayed by up to 10 months, in part because of persistent rumours that an amnesty for illegal immigrants might occur. The data indicate that the overstay rate is increasing, and is especially high for students from the People's Republic of China and Korea. That overstay rate compares with an overstay rate of 1.5 percent for visitors to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to counsel the Government that it should change the  rules in relation to that matter. The Government did not change the rules. The Tiananmen Square massacre occurred. Large numbers of students were here. The Government of the day gave them temporary entry arrangements in the form of a four-year temporary entry visa, and the Government later allowed their spouses and dependent children to join them here in Australia and, of course, provided a range of services and benefits for them and gave them permission to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This severely compromised Australia's immigration program because every other group of people who might want to make claims for refugee status believes that it is entitled to the same sort of concessional arrangement because of that decision. The fact of the matter is that people from Fiji&mdash;and there were thousands of people here from Fiji&mdash;wanted to make those claims. There were many people here from the Middle East who were concerned about their situation, and they also wanted to make those sorts of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that many Khmer boat people whose claims are being considered properly&mdash;I do not question that in any way, shape or form whatsoever; in fact, I have given the Minister encouragement to maintain the principal way of dealing with these issues and questions&mdash;now question the Government's bona fides in relation to that and say that, notwithstanding the proper processing and its outcome, they ought to be able to stay on the same basis on which the Chinese students were allowed to stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decision was so flawed that it undermined this Government's integrity in terms of consistently applying the principles of refugee determination. At every turn the Government is faced with this argument because it did not make the right decision at the time of the Tiananmen Square event. But the Government had the opportunity after that, and particularly after the lessons that were learned by the way in which that matter was dealt with, to correct the situation. It was in a position to make it clear to the Chinese students that, at the end of the four-year temporary entry period, the Government would revert, properly, to determining these matters case by case on the basis of a person's need for protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw what happened to the refugee program generally when of the order of 25,000 students were allowed into Australia after the Tiananmen Square event, under what this Government loosely termed pipeline processing arrangements. Their bona fides were never checked because the Government was somewhat concerned about the demonstrations that were occurring in China at the time. One would have thought that, having then experienced about 17,000 of those people making claims for refugee status and effectively ensuring that the Government cannot deal with these matters without a substantial additional resourcing of the refugee determination process, without having to consider the framework of law under which these matters are determined, and without having to consider the additional cost to the Australian taxpayers&mdash;and I am reliably informed that, if we look at all of the areas associated with refugees, including the Chinese students, it will have cost the Australian taxpayer over half a billion dollars, three times more than the amount of money we want to allocate over time to deal with the black deaths in custody issue&mdash;this Government would have learned its lesson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly concerned, I might say, and it was a major matter of concern to my colleagues in the Opposition, when, in the aftermath of all of those events, the Government through the Prime Minister wrote to a Chinese language newspaper&mdash;not in the form of a press release to the Australian people generally through the mainstream media, but in a specific letter to a specific language newspaper, the Chinese <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Migrants Magazine</EMPHASIS>&mdash;indicating that he wanted to clarify the Government's policy on Chinese nationals in Australia, to put at rest concerns that might have been generated by the Opposition, concerns that might have been generated by me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been making it very clear that the Opposition is of the view, in relation to the Chinese nationals in Australia at that time, that if they had a continuing need for protection, substantiated by refugee type claims, of course they would continue to have that protection, but it would have to be substantiated. If they were able to make claims under the ordinary immigration criteria that any other applicant was able to make and which is consistently applied, such as spouse grounds or occupational grounds, of course they ought to be allowed to apply for a grant of resident status. If they cannot substantiate claims for protection or apply on the same basis as anybody else for permanent residency, then our expectation is that in 1994 they should leave Australia. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has made it clear that Chinese nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 will not be required to return to China against their will&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, the Prime Minister made a selective announcement in the Chinese <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Migrants Magazine</EMPHASIS> that those students who had been granted the temporary entry permits until 1994 would not be required to return to China against their will&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unless they had seriously breached Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 30 June 1994, subject to a need for ongoing protection, places in the immigration program and conditions in China, permanent residence or extended temporary stay will be available to those reluctant to leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chinese nationals who arrived after 20 June are subject to the same non-discriminatory criteria as other temporary residents to Australia if they apply for permanent residence or refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA>So the same rules that apply to anybody else would apply to the post-Tiananmen Square students or nationals. But if they were those who were the subject of the special Hawke deal, they were still to be treated differently. This does not occur for any other group of nationals. When it occurred in relation to the Lebanese community, they were extensions of time of a limited duration, and the Minister brought them to an end, and those who were still here at that time had to go; in relation to the Sri Lankans, they are still of limited duration; and in relation to those from Yugoslavia, they are still of limited duration. This Government has put in place a flawed decision and it has been compounded by the actions of this Prime Minister. It puts at risk the very basis upon which we can continue to control immigration and refugee determination in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government does not change it and does not walk away from this announcement by the Prime Minister, then the national interest is very severely compromised. That is why,  in the light of the statements made by honourable members opposite, we have brought home to them once again their failure in this regard, and we are giving them an opportunity to put the matter right by fresh announcements at this time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose responding to this matter of public importance had to occur because of the number of press releases being put out by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), over a long period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not walk away from that at all. I am a member of this Government. I am bound, like all members on this side, by the decisions of this Government. Let me say a few things about this decision.

I will address that in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us restate the policy. The decision was made and the Prime Minister's letter to the editor said nothing new. It did no more or less than restate the policy announced by the Government on 27 June 1990. What will happen at the end of that four-year period? I invite honourable members to go back and look at the press statement that was issued by the Prime Minister at that time. It is quite clear that there is no automatic permanency for anybody at the end of the four years because the status of people at the end of that period will depend on conditions in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People from the PRC who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 will have to apply for either a temporary entry permit or, depending on the circumstances in China, as referred to in the second paragraph of the Hawke statement, and subject to places in the migration program, a permanent resident's permit. </PARA>

Let us not forget that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the comments made by the shadow Minister with regard to what ought to happen in other countries. I take the honourable member's mind back to comments that he made on 5 January 1990 at a Vietnamese function. His press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Philip Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs, today suggested that the United Kingdom Government should rethink its policy on forced return of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all right to get on the grand speaking circuit and go around the other communities and say, `It is dreadful what they are doing to your people in Hong Kong and return them to Vietnam'. The shadow Minister can offer advice to everybody else, particularly when he is at a Vietnamese function and he wants to get a big clap and a big cheer from the mob when he leaves. That is different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members here, as I have asked before:  who in Australia wanted to return the Chinese at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre? There were not too many people. I invite the shadow Minister to look at the editorials and at what was said by members of his own Party. The problem with immigration is that everybody is an expert, including the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), two former immigration Ministers. Everybody has a million ideas about what is the best thing to do. They are on both sides of the Parliament, I might add, something particularly clear to me because those honourable members used to occupy my seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with immigration is that too often people make a quick statement such as that. The honourable member cannot lecture Hong Kong about it being wrong to send people home to Vietnam and then say in this Parliament that it is good enough to send home people who most people here in the Australian community said were deserving of protection. I ask him again to read that statement. It refers to having to pass normal health and character checks. The honourable member mentioned character checks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the 1970s, to what the Liberal Party policy was in terms of boat people. Let us go back to the thorough examination case by case that those opposite implemented then. I can say to them that it was not very thorough; I have had a look at what they did and it was not very thorough. Those opposite think it is okay to throw stones at this side of the Parliament today. But it is a double-edged sword. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member talked about people and independence. All long term temporary entry residents are entitled to bring their dependants here. Everybody else does. The honourable member knows that. He is deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee that constantly berates me with reports about what ought to be done on immigration. The honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), between them, have seen more witnesses than most other people in the history of the Parliament. Those people are entitled to bring their spouses and their children here. It happens for everyone else. But they have not been given permanency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have to be serious about this. They have tried to score a cheap point at my expense about the way I have been trying to address the intake and the current dilemma that we have with the large number of people in the queue. The honourable member and I have no disagreement about the people in the queue and case by case. We agree totally on that and we agree totally on the stance I am taking with the Cambodians and anybody else who is in that situation. I am grateful for that level of support that he has given me on this issue and other issues that will be discussed in this place later today; I appreciate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have to differ with the honourable member for Dundas on this. I repeat that, if he looks at the statement, he will see that there is no automatic permanent residence for people; so it is wrong to allude to that. It is a fact that they ought not to be sent home against their will. The honourable member can shake his head; but there is a significant difference in immigration law on that point and he well knows it. That is the difference in the position that we are putting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is a very difficult one. I reject the argument that the honourable member has put that that decision has jeopardised our immigration program. I think a number of factors led to the large number of people here. The honourable member has touched on some of them perhaps. But there was a combination of events. There was Tiananmen Square; there were a large number of people here at the time; and of course, there was the subject matter raised in the letter from the honourable member from Melbourne Ports to which the honourable member for Dundas alluded. There was a combination of events, so it is not correct to say that the single point that brought about this so-called dilemma was the announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to that meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, and I think the honourable member for Calwell may have been there as well. It was a very moving ceremony, with some 10,000 or so people present. I remember the editorials the next day. I point out that at the time when the decision was made and the extension by Senator Robert Ray given, to which the honourable member referred, a press release from the honourable member on 8 December 1989 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, to extend the temporary entry arrangements for Chinese students now in Australia.</PARA>

Every time we have attempted to strengthen and improve the processing, I have been bagged by some do-gooding organisation for taking a stance to protect the interests of this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that those opposite accepted the fact that people on both sides of politics were concerned and expressed grave concerns for the safety of these people being forced back to China; they should accept that as a fact. I put it to those opposite that if they read the statement, they will see that it goes into the point about conditions that will apply in China in 1994. It says that. Clearly, if the conditions have improved in China in 1994, of course we will not forcibly send anybody home; but there is a hell of a difference between temporary entry and permanent residence. Most people interested in immigration understand that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting point was that when the student delegations came to see me in this place, they put a very strong point to me: they did not want to be forced into a permanent residency situation because, as the overwhelming majority of them said, once things settled down in China, they were going to go home. They said it to other members in this Parliament too, and it has been reported in the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only act on decisions that have been made by government, as can the honourable member for Dundas if ever he is of enough force to have this position.

It does not mean automatic permanency. I tell those opposite that they will not divert me, by constantly raising this issue, from the job at hand, which is to ensure that when I leave this job we have by far and away the best refugee processing system in the world&mdash;if we do not have it now. But it certainly will be much stronger in the coming months than it has been, and the honourable member for Dundas and I are going to have dialogue about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those opposite that I do not think we are under threat; we are not, and those opposite know that. We are standing firm in saying that those who arrived post-Tiananmen Square will be dealt with case by case, so we are on track there, and the others, pre-Tiananmen Square, if they are after permanency, will also be dealt with case by case. That is what has to happen. It is a natural consequence of the way in which immigration works. So those opposite are wrong to suggest that some sort of bulk granting of permanent residency is going to be issued to these people when they know quite clearly that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take their point, if I am totally honest&mdash;and I try to be&mdash;that this was a particular dilemma for the Government at the time, and it also has caused other people to say, `Well, what about us?'.

Let us look at the specific case of the Chinese students who were here before the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 1989, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia were given four-year temporary visas to stay&mdash;to remain. This decision to grant those visas was virtually a unilateral decision of an emotionally influenced Prime Minister who, in one fell swoop, corrupted the immigration program of this country. As my colleague the honourable member for Dundas has mentioned, none of the usual checks were made, as these people were then temporary students studying the English language within Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year about 14,000 dependants are expected to join the students in Australia; so we have a situation of about 34,000 people being involved. Of course, social security and other benefits were extended as a consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Minister that this decision&mdash;this emotion-ridden decision by the former Prime Minister, compounded by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;has very strongly militated against the community support for our refugee and humanitarian program. Furthermore, it has acted to encourage the belief that the due process of assessment on a case by case basis can be circumvented at the whim of an emotion-ridden Prime Minister or through the calculated application of political pressure on his party. I say `Prime Minister' without specifying whether it was the old one or the new one, because they seem to be equally flexible on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Dundas mentioned a largely unsung article that was published in the April edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Migrants</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Magazine</EMPHASIS> when Prime Minister Keating made certain comments. I would like to repeat those comments, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government has made it clear that Chinese nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 will not be required to return to China against their will unless they have seriously breached Australian law. After 30 June 1994, subject to a need for ongoing protection, places in the immigration program and conditions in China, permanent residence or extended temporary stay will be available to those reluctant to leave.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Prime Minister No. 2 has compounded the original emotion-ridden decision of Prime Minister No. 1 to destroy the remaining equity, credibility and morality of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality it is another deal, another sort of shabby abuse of power, another deal which unfortunately the Government&mdash;dominated as it is by the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party&mdash;has as its principal modus operandi. Here is the man who portrays himself as hard-headed, a decision-maker, firm, unswayed, who is going to bring a hard-headed, non-emotional perspective to the immigration issue. And at the first sign of pressure Prime Minister Keating caved in. In an effort to ingratiate himself with the Australian Chinese community, he has brought the final hammer down on the integrity of the Government's refugee and immigration program. He has put sectional interests above those of his nation. As I mentioned, it is in the same genre as the Kirribilli conspiracy; it is an effort to pander to one section of the community; it is typical of the Labor Government's general approach to policy-making in the current era. He has endorsed what many have said: it was bad policy. He has repeated bad policy by compounding it and by committing his Government to repeating it. </PARA>

Subsequent to that, a number of Chinese people have lodged applications where they claim that they may or may not be affected by those events there, too.</PARA>

In this time, it is our Government's refugee and special humanitarian resettlement programs which have provided the opportunity for thousands of people to resettle in Australia free of such discrimination. The Government has also provided humanitarian resettlement to the victims of disturbances, inter-communal conflict and civil war, not only in areas as diverse as Indo-China, Poland and Sri Lanka, but also in Afghanistan and countries in Central and South America.

This is centred around a more tightly integrated economic immigration policy with the Government's major macro-economic and micro-economic reform packages. The National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition was established to promote national standards for skill recognition, to encourage competency based assessments, to develop counselling and referral services, and to promote improvements to occupational regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many reports into immigration over the last 10 years. In one particular report in 1988 a committee advised on Australia's immigration policies. The Government looked into and reformed the way in which overseas skills were treated in Australia. Skills is a category that the Opposition continually reiterates we need to have more of. What it does not keep bringing into debates on immigration is the fact that, if immigration levels were to stay at the present percentage, the population born overseas in the year 2031 would be 20 per cent, which is a little below the present 22 per cent. While migration requires additional investment in productive capital and infrastructure, in the long run an expanding population historically has increased economic output in similar proportion and has therefore provided the broad capacity to fund infrastructure and investment. The Opposition never brings that before the House. It also has not brought before the House a report of the Bureau of Immigration Research which was released in 1991. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the exception of those from Lebanon and Vietnam, immigrants of working age are less likely to receive a pension or benefit than their Australian born counterparts. As well, the value of overseas pensions paid to immigrants in Australia is almost double that of Australian pensions paid overseas. These results do not confirm the opinion sometimes expressed that immigrants are over-users of the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not hear that before the House. Since I have been elected as a Federal member of parliament, all we have had as a debate on immigration, which came before this House as a matter of public importance, is a referral to a reference of a statement made nearly two years ago. Why, I ask the honourable member for Dundas, the honourable member for Moore and particularly the coalition, did it take it this long, if it had a concern with that statement, to bring it before this Parliament. It has had opportunities day in and day out. It was not only gutless&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes changes to the merit review system established as part of the major amendments of the Migration Act in 1989. The changes are designed to enhance the position of the applicants for review. The Bill also increases penalties in the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and makes a number of other minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, in 1989, established a two-tier merits review system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The first tier is the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO). The second tier is the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) which is an independent external review agency. As I noted in the House of Representatives on 17 April 1991 the objectives of the review system continue to be achieved. That is to say, the review system provides independent review which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Further legislative changes have been made to enhance the review system and I refer honourable members to the Migration Amendment Act 1991 which introduced a number of important changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will make two further changes to the review system. Firstly, the Bill will clarify the matters which may be considered by MIRO or the IRT when reviewing an assessment under section 30 of the Act. Section 30 provides for an assessment to be made of an applicant's qualifications with points awarded for each qualification as prescribed in the Migration Regulations. It is a criterion for the grant of some visas that the applicant receive more than a specified number of points when assessed under section 30. At present the Act does not indicate whether MIRO or the IRT are required to consider changes to the Migration regulations, prescribing points for qualifications, which occur subsequent to the original decision on the application. It is possible that the points awarded for a particular qualification may increase or decrease in the period between the original decision and the review stage. The Bill will insert a new section 121A into the Act which will provide that points under section 30 are to be assessed by MIRO and the IRT in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the original decision. However, if the regulations prescribing points and qualifications which are in force at the time of the review will lead to a more favourable outcome for the applicant, those regulations will apply instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change to the review system which will be effected by this Bill is a technical amendment to ensure that illegal entrants who may be invited by the IRT to lodge an application for an entry permit under section 121 are not prevented from doing so by section 37. Section 37 is designed to prevent illegal entrants from delaying their departure from Australia by lodging a sequence of applications for entry permits. That section was not intended, contrary to what one construction of the language might indicate, to prevent illegal entrants from lodging an application when invited to do so by a review authority. Section 37 will therefore be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the issue of the level of penalties provided for offences created by the Act. Honourable members will appreciate that the Migration Act creates a number of criminal offences dealing with such matters as illegal entry to Australia, obstruction of officers, and escaping from custody. In line with the Government's determination to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the penalties provided in the Act have recently been reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pecuniary penalties, provided as an alternative to imprisonment, were found to be below the levels now considered appropriate in terms of Commonwealth criminal law policy. That policy is expressed in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and provides that maximum pecuniary penalties are to be determined in accordance with a formula whereby six months of imprisonment equates to $3,000. For example, the offence of escaping from custody in section 171 of the Act currently has a penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both. These are, of course, the maximum penalties which a court may impose. Under the proposed amendment the penalty set out in the Migration Act will be two years imprisonment. However, application of the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act&mdash;$3,000 per six months of imprisonment&mdash;will increase the maximum pecuniary penalty from $5,000 to $12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offences in the Migration Act which will not be subject to the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act are those where no imprisonment option is provided. The majority of those penalties will also be increased to maintain relativity with the penalties derived under section 4B(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition I should mention those offences relating to the arranging of non-genuine relationships for the purpose of securing permanent residence in Australia. Persons who arrange contrived relationships to defeat Australia's migration laws will risk penalties of $100,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. These penalties were introduced recently in the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and reflect the need for a more substantial deterrent in this area than would be provided by the application of the section 4B(2) formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also introduce a number of other less significant, but nonetheless important, amendments to the Migration Act to which I will make brief reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">References to powers of arrest will be removed from sections 92 and 93 and from a number of related sections to ensure that no confusion arises between the powers under the Act to take persons into what might be termed `migration custody' and the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers who exercise powers under the Migration Act to take persons into custody do so for specific purposes under the Migration Act related to migration processing and/or removal from Australia. Those powers are, therefore, not subject to the restrictions set out in the Crimes Act 1914 which apply to the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. However, to make this distinction absolutely clear the term `arrest' has been removed from a number of sections of the Act and replaced with the term `detain in custody'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the proposed amendments to section 20 of the Act. Section 20 identifies a number of matters which would result in a person becoming an illegal entrant unless those matters are disclosed in a notice under section 20. For example, a person suffering from a prescribed disease or a prescribed physical or mental condition must disclose that fact in a section 20 notice. If a visa or entry permit is subsequently granted to the person who has made the required disclosure that visa or entry permit must be endorsed with a statement that the person is recognised to be a person to whom section 20 applies. In other words a person who has, for example, a prescribed disease, must have that fact acknowledged on their visa or entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The migration regulations currently permit the endorsement to be in the form of a code recognisable only by departmental officers. Despite this, the requirement for an endorsement can cause embarrassment or offence to some persons. The proposed amendment will provide that the obligation to endorse the visa or entry permit will be satisfied if the information is recorded in a departmental database. A number of other minor technical amendments will be made by the Bill. These are explained adequately in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to foreshadow major Government amendments to the Bill which I will move during the committee stage. The Government is conscious of the extraordinary nature of the measures which will be implemented by the amendment aimed at boat people. I believe it is crucial that all persons who come to Australia without prior authorisation not be released into the community. Their release would undermine the Government's strategy for determining their refugee status or entry claims. Indeed, I believe it is vital to Australia that this be prevented as far as possible. The Government is determined that a clear signal be sent that migration to Australia may not be achieved by simply arriving in this country and expecting to be allowed into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will, of course, continue to honour its statutory and international obligations as it always has done. Any claims made by these people will be fully and fairly considered under the available processes, and any persons found to qualify for Australia's protection will be allowed to enter. Until the process is complete, however, Australia cannot afford to allow unauthorised boat arrivals to simply move into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no wish to keep people in custody indefinitely and I could not expect the Parliament to support such a suggestion. Honourable members will note that the amendment calls for custody for a limited period. The period provided for in the amendment is 273 days&mdash;this translates into nine months. This period is, however, restricted to that time where consideration of a person's claims is directly within the control of my Department. Where factors are outside the control of my Department, the period is suspended. For example, where it is up to the applicant to provide information relevant to a claim, the time taken to provide that information would not be included in the period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will understand that although under optimum conditions new procedures allow for the processing of border claimants in about two months, there is at present no guarantee that the process cannot be delayed. It would be a concern if that could occur. The amendment provides the incentive for the parties involved in the process not to embark on tactics calculated to delay the final processing of claims. For its part, the Government has no desire to keep these people in custody longer than necessary and would prefer that a proper decision is made as quickly as possible. Indeed, it has acted throughout this process with the aim of expediting the finalisation of cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, honourable members, if a claimant's application for refugee status or entry is refused he or she will have to leave Australia. The Department will be under an obligation to effect removal as soon as practicable. This will, of course, always depend on the time it takes to make the appropriate arrangements with the receiving country to properly effect removal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important aspect of this legislation is that it provides that a court cannot interfere with the period of custody. I repeat: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the most important aspect of this legislation is that it provides that a court cannot interfere with the period of custody. No law other than the Constitution will have any impact on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment provides that those boat people already in Australia will be in the new custody from the date this Bill receives the royal assent. In other words, the 273 days will commence on that date. For those unauthorised boat people who arrive in Australia between 27 April and 1 December this year, custody will start when the person is detained. The 273 days will start on the day that the detainee makes an application. The formula for suspending the period applies once the 273-day period starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Designated persons not in custody on the date of royal assent may be detained without warrant and kept in custody. This will mean that persons who have escaped from custody since arriving in Australia and those who may have been released from custody must be taken back into custody. In those cases the 273 days will start to run on the day they are taken back into custody.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing rights and status of a person in other respects of the Migration Act will be unaffected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, in closing, that this legislation is only intended to be an interim measure. The present proposal refers principally to a detention regime for a specific class of persons. As such it is designed to address only the pressing requirements of the current situation. However, I acknowledge that it is necessary for wider consideration to be given to such basic issues as entry, detention and removal of certain non-citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my intention shortly to recommend to Ministers a comprehensive program of legislative amendment to ensure that our immigration law is the best mechanism to deal with current migration issues and needs. The program is being designed in close consultation with the Attorney-General's Department. It will be the result of careful and extended consideration of those issues and needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the House that it is my intention to liaise with the shadow Minister through that process of developing these proposals. I think that this is an issue where we can work towards a bipartisan approach. </PARA>

Such a revised scheme will be of significant benefit to those responsible for administering our migration law, as well as to those subject to it, in terms of simplicity, clarity and fairness.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very supportive of the efforts that have been announced specifically, but, like many of these things, they just do not go far enough or quickly enough. It is a matter of some regret that, even though we sometimes draw these matters to the attention of Government members over long periods, they suddenly seem to forget that and come into the House and try to suggest that some two or three years later we are somewhat belatedly raising an issue. I want to make it very clear that a number of other things can be done, and should be done, and I encourage the Minister to undertake them as additional steps. I am always supportive and always helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces minor policy and technical amendments to the Migration Act. These amendments clarify the regulations a review authority is to have regard to in a review of a points assessment under section 30 of the Act; distinguish the power to detain a person under sections 92 and 93 of the Act from the power of arrest in the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991; increase certain penalties under the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and allow consistent application of pecuniary penalties under the Crimes Act; provide that where an endorsement is recorded in a notified database, that will satisfy the obligation to endorse a visa or an entry permit where this is a requirement under subsections 20(4) or (5); and ensure that  illegal entrants are not further prevented by section 37 from making a further application, within the period allowed by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters which were the purport of the original Bill introduced and passed in the Senate, subject to certain minor amendments, and introduced into this House today, meet with no objection from the Opposition. In relation to the amendments the Minister foreshadowed today in his second reading speech, which he will introduce later, the Opposition is very conscious that there are some 389 boat people in detention around Australia under the current provisions of the Migration Act. There are also, in contemplation, others who may arrive in Australian territorial waters seeking to enter Australia without proper and adequate documentation obtained in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current provisions of the Migration Act, it is possible that the courts can release people into the community before any claims that I might be making for protection are considered or before any entry permit might be granted to a person in accordance with the law. It is our view that no court should have the authority to undertake the release of people into the community contrary to the express wish of the Parliament, expressed in the Migration Act, as to the basis upon which entry permits will be granted. In other words, having eliminated any discretion from Ministers and ourselves, subject to only two specific sections in the Act, I and my colleagues do not believe that any other body should operate under its discretion or inherent powers to release people into the community contrary to the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the law in this area is complex and difficult. Detainees can be held under section 88 of the Act, which deals with those who have been arrested at sea and brought ashore by Australian authorities as prohibited entrants, or under section 92, which deals with those people who have landed without adequate documentation and who are otherwise illegal entrants and are taken into custody after their arrival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to each of those cases, there is a quite complex range of law which applies differently in each case and does lead to confusion. The confusion does suggest that there are reasons in relation to that aspect of it for the law to be reformed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that the Minister has foreshadowed are designed to provide for continued detention of all current detainees, and those who might arrive at a later date, while this legislation is in operation. Such people will be held in custody under those provisions for a period of nine months. They have to prosecute any claims they might have for protection as refugees, and they have to do so expeditiously. If they fail to prosecute those matters, or fail to get evidence that is available, the timeframe in which they can be kept will, in effect, stop and the time will run from when they have done all they have to do. The time limits per se are only limits as against the Government and its authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is to provide that a court, except the High Court under its inherent power in relation to habeas corpus, cannot release people who are held in custody under these arrangements. But I am sure the court would have regard to the Parliament's wishes in relation to the way in which these matters are to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Minister would acknowledge that this legislation is seen as tough. I imagine it will not be unchallenged, but I think it needs to be clearly understood that it has the very strong support of the Opposition. We are of the view that the current powers of arrest and the basis on which people are detained are sufficiently cumbersome, outdated and silent as to leave doubt in the minds of some as to whether or not people held in custody can continue to be so held. If that is a weakness, it needs to be cured. This legislation is designed to cure that. It is clear from the terms of the legislation that it in no way alters the obligations we have to offer protection to genuine refugees, as defined by the UN conventions and protocols. The legislation specifically notes that those rights are not affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, however, that along with other countries we have seen a very significant increase in asylum claims over the last decade. As was heard in the earlier discussion&mdash;I hold the Government accountable for much of this&mdash;the fact is that we are having to deal with an increase in claims for refugee status from just on 500 claims a year to something of the order of 23,000. Although we have no land borders and are not subjected to the same pressures that are placed on other countries such as eastern Europe or the Americas, we are particularly vulnerable, particularly with new and modern navigational aids, to an increasing number of people seeking to make the journey here by sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people who are held in custody are released from custody and seek not to be found, their location and removal can be extraordinarily difficult and costly. I have not seen an update of any figures recently, but I imagine they are much higher than the figure I was last given by Senator Ray some four or five years ago, which suggested that it costs in the order of $9,000 a head to find and apprehend people who are illegals and to arrange for their removal, if that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Parliament, as is stated in the proposed amendments, is entitled to form a view that people who enter Australia without adequate documentation are to be held in custody. I make it very clear that for those reasons the Opposition is strongly supportive of the amendments that the Minister has foreshadowed. We will facilitate the passage of the legislation to ensure that those provisions will be able to operate as soon as it is possible for the Bill to be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make something very clear, however, in relation to the third matter which the Minister dealt with&mdash;his foreshadowed further amendments. I said those matters were of a stopgap character and that there was still a great deal more to be done in relation to the handling of refugee issues generally. The Minister says that these amendments are designed to address only very pressing requirements of the current situation. I want to make it clear that there are urgent, pressing and outstanding matters upon which we in the Opposition have consistently offered comments, and which I will talk to the Minister about. But I will emphasise over and over again the matters that I have put clearly on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the backlog of over 23,000 applications for refugee status, which is unconscionable in terms of the national interest. It leads to a situation in which people believe that all they have to do is lodge an application and the Government will not be able to process it in a timely fashion. In such a way, they will be able to remain here and argue that they have been absorbed into the Australian community and never removed. I have not seen expressed any realistic timeframes as to the extent to which resources that have been applied to this task will enable these matters to be processed through all stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are arguments about processing people's applications through the first stage, which has been given priority but, unless they are processed through all stages, control has not been established. Unless the Minister is able to guarantee that he is able to deal with these matters through all stages within a reasonable timeframe, we have lost control. That is the bottom line, and that is why these matters need to be emphasised over and over again until we are prepared to put in place the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear on behalf of the Opposition that as we have cooperated in relation to the matters that are being dealt with now, if the Government is prepared to take up our additional suggestions in relation to providing a requirement for people who have manifestly unfounded claims to have to obtain leave to access the further review procedures in the RSIC, the Government will have our cooperation in putting in place such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Review Council has said that leave would not be an inappropriate provision to put in place, and other specialist advisers in this area have similarly commented. If we have several tiers of consideration and allow every case to access second  and  later  tiers,  further  delay  arises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the traditional arrangements under which Australia has operated these matters have been dealt with administratively. In addition, people can seek judicial review. Under judicial review, there is the possibility of three further stages: a judge at single instance; the Full Court of the Federal Court; and, if people get leave, the High Court of Australia. Certainly, the Opposition recognises that the High Court cannot be denied. Provisions under the Constitution enable it to exercise original jurisdiction. But we are certainly of the view that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, as it extends to this area of immigration law, ought to be amended to exclude this area. That is a matter which ought to be dealt with by this Government, and a matter upon which, if the Government is so inclined to move, it shall have our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the area of staffing and priorities, I regard the crisis that we now face as of such severity that the Government should be prepared to free up all staff from any other area of activity, where that is possible, so that they can be involved in this assessment process. The backlog is such that if it is not reasonably and quickly handled we will remain at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the amendment that I have moved. The Minister asked, `What does it mean?'. Earlier I spoke about the Government's inability to control entry to Australia. The issues that I want to address under this amendment are quite separate and distinct. They relate to the present immigration program, which has been the subject of very considerable criticism from a whole range of sources.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's program has been the subject of very widespread criticism because it does not meet the needs of the national economy. Clearly, it does not have the support of the Australian people, and I suggest that is one of the reasons the Government will be moving to change its policy in this regard. In the middle of the worst recession in 60 years, it is clear that the Australian economy cannot sustain a large influx of new migrants. There are budgetary constraints which mean that settlement services are being cut back and that they are unable to meet the present needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a backlog of some 60,000 to 70,000 people with few English language skills who would like to access such courses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>They are already here and unable to do so. We have a program at the moment that is still delivering an outcome of a large number of low skill, non-English speaking migrants who will find it extraordinarily difficult to find meaningful employment in the present sustained and rather dreadful recession that we have suffered. Of course, when these people come to Australia they constitute a significant drain on very limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not generally known or understood that it was this Government that took the decision to allow those people who were previously allowed entry on a generally relaxed basis in comparison with any other applicants to access welfare benefits without family members having to give assurances of support as they used to in the past. That means that when family members do not have to give those assurances, their brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces continue to seek entry and upon arrival they are immediately eligible for benefits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that they were never policed under this Government. The fact is that, whether they were policed or not, it had a very significant impact upon the shape of the immigration program in the past, because the program itself used to adjust to the economic circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time that this country, in a period of recession, has had a program that has held up in the way in which it has. The reason that it has not fallen off, as it did in the past, is that the skills testing that goes on is not related to the labour market. That was a decision taken by the Minister and his colleagues. Access to benefits has been liberalised by the Minister and his colleagues, to the point where people who would not be able to access benefits in their home country seek to come here knowing that they are eligible immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not argue that cutting the program will reduce unemployment; we have never expressed that view. We do not want to make migrants scapegoats, but we do believe that, in the context of the worst recession in over 60 years, we cannot absorb large numbers of migrants in the way in which this Government has insisted that we do in this recession. In previous recessions we saw the program come off very significantly. I have given those figures before. I simply note that one of the Government's own publications says that in the 1984 recession the program was reduced from a proposed program of 90,000 to 62,000 in  recognition  of  a  tight  labour  market and  reduced  interest among people  to migrate here. That reduced interest was in  the concessional family categories, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition have made the point that there are a number of decisions that can be taken by the Government to ensure that the program more effectively reflects the national interest. We have emphasised the importance of ensuring that testing of bona fides is properly carried out in those areas which are demand driven. Those areas include the preferential family stream, where we believe it is quite appropriate for the Government to introduce concessional migrant entry in the same way as concessional migrant entry is granted for people who, on spouse or de facto grounds, seek a change in status in Australia on the basis of their relationship with an Australian. Those coming from overseas could be put to the same requirement. In my view that would significantly test those who enter into marriage or de facto relationships purely for the purpose of migration entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is important that the testing of bona fides be conscientiously carried out in the area of employment nomination. That is another area in which it is possible for people to try to manipulate criteria to establish entry where otherwise a person would not be eligible. In relation to eligibility for benefits, we have made it very clear that it is part of the Fightback package proposals that, save for refugees and those in the humanitarian stream, we would not provide benefits unless there had been a marked change in circumstances. That period of exclusion would be two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has made it very clear that in the area of concessional entry for family members who are accepted under the points testing arrangements, some testing of their English language competency is appropriate. Such testing already occurs in relation to skilled entry. We do not believe that it is inappropriate for such testing to occur in this area. In relation to skills testing, we think it is certainly very appropriate that that ought to be made relevant to the labour market requirements here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put these views strongly over time in a positive and constructive way with a view to helping the Government make the reductions that we believe are absolutely necessary and in the national interest. It is certainly our view that if we look at past periods of recession we will find some guidance as to the size of the program that Australia has had. Never in a period of recession of very much less severity than this one have we had programs that have exceeded 70,000 net as an outcome. On the basis of past experience and on the basis of the advice that the Government has had from its own specialist advisers&mdash;the National Population Council, the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance, the Treasury and the Department of Social Security&mdash;and from members of the Government's own back bench, there is very good reason why these adjustments should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said that he could not understand what our amendment was about. It is clearly intended to allow us to put on the public record the position that we believe ought to be taken in these matters, and, as always in this area, our comments are intended to be helpful and constructive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for standing firm on the issue of the Cambodian and Chinese boat people. I know that this has been done in the face of considerable pressure from so-called humanitarian groups and sleazy lawyers who have made immigration matters their specialty. These people have not been short of bleeding-heart media support. While we are talking about bleeding-heart support, I will just deal briefly with the Opposition's amendment. In my view, it is an attempt to grandstand. If the Opposition is serious, it ought to be putting forward very firm proposals on what it will do with immigration, which clearly needs to be cut dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what the Opposition is about was demonstrated by its Leader (Dr Hewson) when he was very unfairly attacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the ground of racism. There is nothing racist at all about what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. It was quite a scurrilous attack. In defending himself, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Of course, when the economy improves we will vastly increase immigration'. He then added, `If we don't, somebody else will do it for us'. So those opposite would not only vastly increase immigration, they would also give away Australia's sovereignty, which is something I thought we had invested heavily in with the F111s, purchased by the Liberal Party, to defend our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That statement was one of the most unctuous, deplorable statements I have heard. It does indicate that over time the Liberal Party has historically been the party of high immigration. It is true that in recent times the Labor Party, too, has been led astray. However, historically, the Liberal Party has been the high immigration party. I am hoping that sense will prevail in the Labor Party and that we will get back to our genuine roots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who takes the time to look past his or her nose and into the so-called refugee issue will realise that the whole thing is a rort. I commend the increased penalties announced in this Migration Amendment Bill, especially those relating to immigration agents who arrange false marriages in order to facilitate legal immigration. These agents who rort the system in this and other ways are the scum of the earth. They do not give a damn about this country or its best interests;  all they care about is a quick buck, and they are never slow to claim humanitarian motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that under the present Minister, steps are being taken to subject these immigration agents to much closer scrutiny, but I believe much more can be done&mdash;and should be done quickly. I will return to the way that these people manipulate the industry in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to the proposed amendment to section 20 of the Act regarding diseases, so long as the health of the host community is adequately protected. The information on diseases of migrants must not be allowed to just sit in some immigration department database if it is likely to impact on the local community. Information must be passed on to the relevant Commonwealth and particularly State authorities. The inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations of March this year into conditional entry made it clear that important medical information has not been passed on by the Immigration  Department  to  the relevant State authorities. Health monitoring has been compromised as a result. I stress again that the Immigration Department must ensure that information regarding diseases is promptly passed on to the relevant authorities. I must say that the inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee were welcome, if belated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen Rimmer, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Cost of Multiculturalism,</EMPHASIS> pointed out health screening problems, particularly in relation to hepatitis B and tuberculosis, in the middle of last year. I also put a question to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) on notice at the same time. It is clear that the health of the host community has been placed under threat in the past, largely, I believe, out of fear of being branded racist if stricter health screening and subsequent rejections had been enforced. This is only one of the ways that Australian governments have been gutless in regard to immigration matters. They have placed the health of the very people they are charged to protect under threat for motives that were, at the very least, very questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that in future years a Commonwealth government will find itself under a legal claim from locals who have contracted an imported disease because of inadequate screening procedures. If that is so, it will be because of what has happened in the last few years. Australians of the future will have to pay for the negligence of today in this and in so many other ways as far as immigration is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in regard to this amendment Bill, I would state that any move to streamline administrative procedures, so long as quality is not adversely affected, is very welcome. I would go considerably further; I would speed the process of review by having only one tier of review, rather than two as at present. This should be an administrative review. The combination of administrative review and legal review that we have at present is causing undue delay and compromising the entire review process. It allows for rorts in the system to be continued. It clearly does not serve the best interests of the great majority of people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as possible we must get lawyers out of the immigration process. They have a vested interest in delaying and clogging up the system. I say give claimants one chance at review, and one only. We have no obligation at all to give them two goes. Government also has no right to waste public money in this way. Our absurd review process has only come about because governments have caved in to pressure from the immigration industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the immigration industry in general, I recently gave a speech in Sydney to a group of immigration industry members, and I would like to share some of it with the House. At that conference I put them on notice. I said that it was my intention to help knock their snouts out of the public trough, to continue to bring the facts on immigration to light and to act as a representative of the Australian people's wishes on immigration. That, I said, was what democracy was supposed to be about. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia immigration policy has come to be linked with and largely driven by the policy of multiculturalism. In theory the two were supposed to be very separate, and immigration Ministers and other people tell you that they are. Anyone who has eyes to see will see that this is not so.</PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic that the loudmouthed multiculturalists of Australia continually try to impose their values on other countries and lecture them in preaching tolerance and understanding in this country. In regard to other countries, they alternate between self-righteous moralising and cringing appeasement&mdash;a contemptible combination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the very people who infest the universities and the bureaucracies and influence government. They tell us what we must be. They give us no choice in the matter. They do not really believe in democracy, yet they lecture other countries with no history or culture of democracy, telling them that they must be democratic. In Australia they also tell us that we are part of Asia. That the great majority of Australians do not believe it is of no concern to them. We are Australians, happy to get on with being Australian and happy to get on with Asian countries. We do not take kindly to social engineering. We are ourselves, and proud of it, and not something that the elite would have us be. But I can assure this House that the Australian people are running out of patience. They will defend their culture and their country even against their own government, if need be. Both the Government and the Opposition should take very careful note of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rush to this new Australia is in large part driven by guilt about the Australia of the past. Guilt was never the basis for a sensible clear-headed policy, but it permeates our current immigration policy and attitudes to Asia. Each one of the guilt-ridden policies has been imposed from above. Multiculturalism, which was foreshadowed in the Whitlam Government by Al Grassby, was adopted as official policy in the late 1970s by the Fraser Government which followed. The Australian people were never asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sorts of high-sounding words were used to describe the policy of multiculturalism. No-one is denying that equality of opportunity is a noble ideal, but this has merely become a show. Multiculturalism is a corrupt policy in practice. It was introduced to appease select ethnic groups which claimed to represent their broader community&mdash;although there is no evidence that they ever did so. Even as a vote-buying exercise there is no evidence that multiculturalism has been a success. The policy has promoted and enriched individuals and vested interests. It has corrupted academic study and government policy, particularly immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone interested in this subject should read Stephen Rimmer's excellent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Cost of Multiculturalism</EMPHASIS> and his paper on the same subject which I published under the Kalgoorlie Press title. After funding these groups&mdash;and it was mainly Italians and Greeks&mdash;the Fraser Government then found itself under pressure from these groups to fundamentally change immigration policy in a way that would bring more Greeks and Italians to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979 the immigration Minister of the day, Ian Macphee, introduced a family reunion category for which those groups had been calling. In opposition the ALP had also pushed for such a change, and in the late 1970s had established an exclusive Greek-speaking branch in Victoria in the battle over the so-called ethnic vote. However, for all the claims that these groups represented a widespread demand in their communities, very few Greek and Italian people took advantage of the new category to bring out relatives. More British people took advantage of it, but the big users of the new category were Asians. So Asian immigration increased considerably as an unintended consequence of the appeasement of Greek and Italian pressure groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until the mid-1980s that the social engineers saw the potential of such immigration and developed a deliberate policy of Asianisation. It was justified as a way of linking in with the region and increasing our trade with Asia. But as the multiculturalist lobby power grew, such things as English language testing were relaxed. This had nothing to do with what was best for the country. As a result, large numbers of unskilled people with little or no English were accepted. How they would help improve our trade with Asia, particularly when many of them were unemployed, was never explained. It is interesting to note that trade with Hong Kong has gone down over this period, and not up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immigration industry continues to grow, and to understand its influence we have to look at and understand the network. We now have the Office of Multicultural Affairs&mdash;OMA&mdash;within the Prime Minister's Department. It was established there by Bob Hawke in 1985, and its staff were vetted by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia&mdash;FECCA&mdash;which itself depends on government funding. The first head of OMA was the academic adviser to FECCA, Dr Peter Shergold. He is now the head of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I will return to this connection later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">OMA acts as a propaganda unit for the policy of multiculturalism and requires all departments to submit to its discipline on so-called `access and equity' requirements. Increasingly, it is working closely with the Bureau of Immigration Research, the Immigration Department's own propaganda unit, which was established under the Hawke Government in 1988. Both of these organisations are assisted in their aims by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, particularly through Commissioner Irene Moss, whose specialty is racial discrimination. She was largely responsible for a report into racist violence in Australia which only targeted those white Australians whose forebears arrived here before the Second World War, and others of basically `Anglo-Celtic' descent. No consideration at all was given to inter-ethnic violence between migrant groups, which is a far bigger problem in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moss began with the intention of documenting racist violence against Asians by whites, but did not find enough to justify her inquiry. So she turned to relations between whites and Aboriginals. The bulk of her report turns on this aspect and largely duplicates the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was already under way. Incidentally, the Royal Commission was agreed to in 1988, the Bicentennial year, when the Hawke Government feared that Aboriginal groups might disrupt the celebrations. In the previous years there had been considerable publicity given to a number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It was widely believed that far more Aboriginals died in custody than whites. In fact, it was soon discovered that proportionally more whites died in custody than blacks&mdash;not only numerically, but proportionally. This, of course, did not stop the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Moss report and the Royal Commission have been used by professional multiculturalists to press for increases in their own powers and the power of bureaucracies. As far as Aboriginal affairs goes, Aboriginal activist Gary Foley has remarked that what Nugget Coombs said in 1974&mdash;that about three-quarters of Aboriginal affairs money goes to white bureaucrats&mdash;still holds good, although a lot of these white bureaucrats have now been joined by what I would term professional Aboriginals. So the multiculturalists and their bureaucracies use Aboriginals to expand their own empires and have for some time wanted to make Aboriginal affairs part of their empire. Although this has met considerable hostility from Aboriginals, the appointment of the former head of OMA, Dr Peter Shergold, to head ATSIC shows that they have at least been partly successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Moss report and the report on black deaths in custody have been repeatedly referred to as reasons why restrictive racial vilification legislation should be introduced. Both of these reports basically revolved around Aboriginals, but they are used to justify the expansion of bureaucracies which have nothing to do with Aboriginals. That is just the excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Reform Commission, headed by Justice Elizabeth Evatt, is also in the process of making recommendations which would compromise the integrity of our legal system in order to take account of so-called multicultural considerations. Her draft report recommends an increased role for all the old favourites&mdash;the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the Bureau of Immigration Research and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Very cosy indeed. It gives us an idea of how the network operates and how each group supports the other getting increased powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also State anti-discrimination boards which act in a similar manner. In the universities there are a number of immigration and multicultural units which churn out propaganda and act as power bases for the policy and the immigration program. They also act as watchdogs within the universities. Churches also fund their own similar bodies which link in with the network. There are strong connections, for instance, between the Catholic social justice unit and the trendy Left of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the fringes are a host of other groups which get government funding and are connected with the multiculturalism/immigration industry. There are also private sector immigration agents and lawyers with a vested interest in maintaining high immigration. The industry is very well connected to the media and has no problem in getting its viewpoint across. It gives honourable members some idea of the power of the lobby and its potential to influence immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who seriously wants to understand immigration policy in Australia should closely study the immigration industry and see how it uses its influence. To pretend that the Government has progressed with the national interest as its sole criteria, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine has done, is quite farcical. These groups have a vested interest in maintaining high immigration, whatever the economic circumstances. With our money they actively work against the adoption of an immigration policy which will serve the best interests of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), head of the Caucus immigration and ethnic affairs committee and head of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, is one of the specialists in this area. He has put forward a proposal for immigration zones which is clearly designed to give more weight to immigration from southern and eastern Europe. This has been pushed once again by Greek and Italian professional ethnics. It is ironic that, in spite of all the influence they have exerted, they still think that the immigration program works against them. It is also ironic that vested interest groups need a cover to push their own demands. One migrant pressure group, in order to get what it wants and appear non-discriminatory, has to allow other migrants from different groups to come in under the same category. Quite often these migrant groups have no time for each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So immigration appeasement is a blunt instrument. If the Government gives in to one group, it faces demands and potential demands from others and so offers immigration concessions to them. The result is that we import conflicts from abroad and our policy of multiculturalism encourages them to continue. To many of these people, Australia is just a funding base rather than a country which they should identify with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there was a nice irony which came to light recently regarding inter-ethnic rivalry. Recently Greek and Italian pressure groups claimed that they were being discriminated against by SBS radio programming which gave less weight to their programs. The vast bulk of these people can speak English, so such programs are mainly a status symbol. But it was their pressures which changed the immigration policy and allowed many of the more recent migrants to come here in the first place. Now they feel they are being pushed aside by the very people whose entry they facilitated. And they now complain that they are being discriminated against once more. What a farce!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government numbers man in the Senate, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson), in his usual manner was very quick to attempt to appease the protesters by offering another radio band. This is the way that governments have proceeded when it comes to multiculturalism and immigration. In short, the history of both major political parties in recent times has been gutless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has recently assured Chinese pressure groups that 20,000 Chinese students allowed to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre will be granted residence. Mr Hawke had tearfully assured them that they would not be sent back to China against their will, although there is little doubt that there was not one genuine refugee amongst them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has followed this affair knows that there are grave doubts about the legitimacy of claims of many of these people even to be students. They used private English language classes which were established under the control of an inept and incompetent section of the department of education as a way of gaining back door entry to Australia. The department was only concerned about a quick and easy way to gain foreign exchange, which it thought private English language schools would provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has now assured the Chinese students who arrived before the Tiananmen Square massacre that they can stay. They will, of course, bring out relatives under the family reunion scheme. It is interesting to ask ourselves: how did the Prime Minister make his announcement? Did he do it in parliament or in an address to the Australian people? That is not the way these things are done. In the time-honoured way of appeasement for perceived electoral gain, he went to an ethnic pressure group. He wrote a letter to a local Chinese magazine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of Cambodians applying for refugee status were quick to demand similar treatment. Most of these Cambodians were initially rejected as refugees, but enormous pressure has been placed on the Minister for Immigration by vested interests and chest thumping humanitarians to allow them to stay. I say again: I believe this Minister has done more than any Minister in my memory to resist these pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the way we conduct immigration policy in Australia these days. It is not very inspiring. If the people of Australia think it is out of control, I would say that is a very good guess.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised some issues which I think are of great significance to the debate on the migration intake of Australia. There are a couple of things that I would like to discuss with him. The first relates to the `diseases of migrants'. This is one amendment which has been foreshadowed and which is to be included in the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a proper concern amongst the Australian people about the possibility of exotic diseases being brought to Australia and transmitted to the Australian community by unscreened migrants. This is a very difficult area because it is an emotional one. I noticed that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about hepatitis B and tuberculosis. One of the medical checks which was in place for many years was a requirement for intending migrants to be screened for tuberculosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that have come about in recent times to a much greater degree is the capacity for visitors to come to Australia in ever increasing numbers. At this stage we have  Government Ministers encouraging tourism to Australia just as hard as they can go. In fact, the tourism industry is now the major export earner in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism involves visitors from all over the world&mdash;visitors who are unscreened. The suggestion that there is a greater danger to the Australian population from a restricted immigration intake&mdash;restricted to an extent which, of course, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie thinks is not nearly enough&mdash;than from the literally millions of visitors who come to Australia each year unscreened, I think, on reflection, does not hold water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people are discussing this aspect of the immigration program, they need to consider the full range of people coming to Australia and not to stir up unfounded fears within the Australian community in an area which, I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, does need attention, but certainly needs to be assessed with the complete range of people coming to Australia taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said was that lawyers should be kept out of the immigration process&mdash;and I say `Hear, hear' to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the great problems that have occurred, particularly since this Government has come to power, is that the immigration program has been taken over by the lawyers. Successive Ministers for immigration have found it extraordinarily difficult to administer properly their responsibilities under their oath of office, simply because the lawyers and the courts have assumed an ever increasing role and to that extent in many ways have taken control of the program away from the Minister and the government of the day.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to make sure that the legal system does not preclude the government of the day and the Minister of the day from exercising their responsibilities properly. I think that has occurred to a very great extent, and I am very pleased to see that the amendments coming before the House today go at least some way towards resolving that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about was the protection of the Australian culture, as though the Australian culture is something written on tablets of stone and has not been altered over the many years since European settlement in Australia, which is again simply nonsense. Again, in this immigration debate we do need to understand that culture, if it is to have any significance at all, is a living, breathing entity and changes as the community changes and as time passes. If it did not, we would be in a very difficult situation indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my belief that immigration programs of the past&mdash;not just since the Second World War&mdash;have had a very significant and beneficial effect on the development of Australian culture, and I hope will continue to do so. It always intrigues me when those people within Australia who are themselves migrants or the descendants of migrants want to lock the door and say, `Nobody else can come in. We are all right, Jack. Pull up the ladder and let's stop everything here'. I do not know the family history of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie but I will bet London to a brick that it is not very long since his family or he was a migrant to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at this total migration debate, one has to keep very much in mind the development of migration procedures and an understanding of those people already in Australia, of course, but also those people wishing to come to Australia. Having done that, it seems to me that we are really facing in the future a situation which we have not faced as a nation before. The potential for refugee arrival in Australia is at a level which we really have not faced before. Our refugee procedures need to take into account the potential that lies around us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest issues in the world today concerns the fate of refugees. One cannot go to any continent in the world&mdash;with the exception of Australia&mdash;where there are not significant refugee problems and an increasing number of people who come into the category of refugees. Australia simply cannot deal with all those who seek asylum and resettlement, and therefore any government needs to make very clear decisions as to what can be achieved, how many people can be catered for in the refugee category and who they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I do not believe that we have a clear delineation from the Government as to how that selection procedure is to be handled; it is an area which needs further attention. I would hate to see a situation develop in Australia where we needed to have refugee camps. That would be a dreadful thing, and I hope that procedures are put in place that will obviate this necessity. But I think&mdash;and the evidence is clearly before us&mdash;that the current situation cannot be supported. Here again I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie; although I would not use the phrases that he did, I certainly agree with his sentiments when he said that one of the great problems that we face came about because of an emotional reaction by the previous Prime Minister to the events in Tiananmen Square. It is disgraceful what has occurred as a result of that. It has been very unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the attitude and the words of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, when he said that it was an extremely emotional time. It certainly was, and one of the most difficult things to do at an emotional time is to keep in one's head a clear-headed rationality and approach to immigration questions. Once an immigration decision has been made, it is immensely difficult to reverse it&mdash;and the ramifications of a decision can extend well into the future, which has occurred in the case of the Chinese students. There is no doubt that that decision has distorted the immigration program, and it continues to so do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one was extremely disappointed by the manner in which the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has written a letter&mdash;not made a public statement about it&mdash;to a Chinese paper, as I understand it, making a further decision on this matter. He quite rightly is the subject of criticism, both from our side of the Parliament and from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I make is that mistakes have been made in the past, particularly since this Government has come to office. Those mistakes have particularly centred around the takeover of the immigration area by the legal profession. I am glad to see that the Government is at last doing something about that, and I agree with the honourable member for Dundas when he says that it is too late and what we are encouraging is a more rapid addressing of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to understand is that the present situation really has led to a more rapid inflow from low skilled, low resourced people who have a very difficult time in integrating successfully into the Australian community than we should have had. That has been the practical result of the implementation of the policies of this Government. That needs to be changed and the Opposition is making a very determined effort and a very clearly stated effort to reverse that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the changes that have been outlined in the original Bill and the amended Bill, as mentioned by the Minister in this chamber. But, in speaking to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas, I say that the attitude that the Minister has displayed goes some way towards meeting the real problems that have surfaced in this immigration debate but it does not go far enough or quickly enough. He says that he is always getting advice from people. I know that as Minister for Immigration one thing one never lacks is advice; one gets it from everywhere. But I urge him to look carefully at the advice that has been proffered, with the very best will in the world, by the Opposition. If he accepted that advice, I believe we would get this thing under control. It certainly has been out of control until the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a rather wide ranging discussion this afternoon in relation to the amendments contained in the Migration Amendment Bill 1992 and, in particular, the recent amendments proposed by the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret very much that in recent times we have had a considerable breakdown of the bipartisanship on some key matters with respect to immigration. It is interesting that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has made a number of statements accusing the Government of wanting to break the bipartisanship when in fact it was he, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who first initiated some very key divergences from the previous bipartisan positions that we had on immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas in which he says that he `deplores the Government's failure to reconstruct the immigration program to more accurately reflect the current needs of the national economy and to deliver a program that is in the long term interests of Australia'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I include the press statements which were contrary to the spirit of the assurances that he has given me over a period about the position of the Opposition. The whole tenor of this is essentially hypocritical because there is no doubt that the Government, in its reconstruction of the immigration program, has been looking very closely at the needs of the national economy. But, as the honourable member for Dundas knows, there is disagreement in the community and amongst experts about the relationship between immigration and the national economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the long term interests of Australia must surely lie with a sustained and substantial immigration program, not with panicking in the face of some recessionary pressures and slashing immigration for opportunistic reasons, which is the position which has been advocated by the Opposition. It is not only that, of course, because the long term interests of Australia include, and have always included, achieving an immigration program which is supported by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An immigration program that is supported by the Australian people is a program that is seen to be fair and just by the Australian people. The honourable member for Dundas is not interested in such a program. In recent times he has been particularly angry with me for suggesting that his calls for the introduction of English language requirements into the concessional family category are in fact discriminatory. I repeat in this House that to introduce an English language test into a family reunion program is essentially to introduce a discriminatory criterion with respect to some families vis-a-vis others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas issued a press statement a little while ago saying that I have a fixation with the family reunion program and cannot get away from it. The reality is that the family reunion program, sociologically, my dear colleague, has proved to be the most successful aspect of our immigration program. I challenge the honourable member to give any information to the contrary. The family reunion program involves people bringing their relatives here. When they bring them here they work very hard to put together assistance for them. They help them find jobs, they help them to look after their children, they help them to learn English, and they help them to fit into the community. That is an undisputed fact about our settlement patterns in Australia that has been commented on for many years by people who have studied this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has had one of the most successful immigration programs in the world. The key aspect of it has been the family reunion program. So I make no apologies for wanting the retention of the family reunion program. The fact that I want to keep a balance between the independent immigration program and the family reunion program is considered by the honourable member for Dundas to be a fixation which is against the long term interests of Australia. What rubbish! If there is anything that is against the long term interests of Australia, it is the recent opportunistic behaviour of the honourable member for Dundas and the Leader of the Opposition in attacking the family reunion program and suggesting that, somehow, migrants who come under the family reunion program are far inferior to those who come under the independent program. That is absurd, and it is not borne out by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the family reunion program has brought to this country people who have made massive contributions, including in the economic area. Let me take one of the suggested criteria. Some of the most distinguished Australians who migrated to this country&mdash;some of the biggest achievers in this country's history&mdash;could not speak English when they arrived. Under the proposal of the honourable member for Dundas we would introduce that criterion into the family reunion program and such persons would never be able to come here, irrespective of the fact that they already have to meet under the family reunion program educational criteria, job skills criteria and age criteria. In other words, they have to be young, educated, dynamic people, but we say, `We are sorry, but because you don't speak English you can't come under the family reunion program'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas would have us believe that one could actually introduce such a system and claim it was not discriminatory. The reality is that, after the 1987 report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, this Government accepted a compromise, on which we based our immigration program. The compromise was very clear. It said that the family reunion program would not have an English language requirement, but we accepted that the independent category would have an English language requirement. There was a balance reached between those who wanted an English language requirement for all immigrants and those who wanted it for none. We reached a compromise, a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that, in the independent category, because these people were coming for specific jobs in specific areas in the Australian economy, it was fair enough to bring in the English language requirement. But it was made perfectly clear at that time that the concessional family category would not have an English language requirement. For the honourable member for Dundas to be putting forward this claim is to introduce a discriminatory criterion. I must say that I reject that approach, and I also reject his claims about the long term impact on the current balance. The current balance has worked well for Australia and it should continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition in recent times has seemed to grab onto whatever it can find in order to appear different from the Government, so it has picked on this idea of the English language requirement. It has decided to attack the family reunion component. Unfortunately the people who are affected do not have sufficient voice in the House of Representatives, in the Senate and in the whole Australian establishment. But they are the people whose families will be seriously affected because they will not be able to reunite with their relatives. It is fine for us who have all our families here to say to other people, `We are going to set down these criteria, and it is too bad if you cannot reunite with your families'. I personally think that to proceed with such an approach would end up creating very severe social tensions in this country. It would not be in Australia's best long term interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return for a moment to the economic argument. One of the interesting things about the economic argument that ought to be put on the record is this: when the Minister went around the various groups discussing immigration, a number of the key business groups&mdash;the Housing Industry Association, for example&mdash;pointed out to him the importance of continuing with a reasonable level of immigration in this country for economic reasons. It is interesting that those groups, with the exception of the Housing Industry Association, have not decided to say very much about it publicly. They have talked to the Minister about it, they have talked to other people and other members of parliament about it, including myself, but those business groups have not been prepared to come out and say what they have said privately about the economics of immigration. They have not been prepared to do so. One wonders whether that is because the Leader of the Opposition has taken such a strong anti-immigration stand and they do not want to embarrass him. If we are to have an honest debate about the economics of immigration in this country, two things become perfectly clear. Firstly, there is absolutely no evidence&mdash;none whatever&mdash;that any respectable academic is prepared to put up that immigration contributes to unemployment. On the contrary, the evidence is either that the effect is neutral or that it can contribute in a positive way to creating employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the myth persists throughout the whole of this community that immigration is a negative for employment. It is a myth which continues to be peddled as a result of the sorts of statements that have been made by the honourable member for Dundas and by the Leader of the Opposition. Frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves, because on their own economic theory, the economic theory of the Murphy model which they used in Fightback, immigration is a positive for the economy. They have ignored all that. They have decided to use one model for Fightback, but they have ignored the immigration aspect and what the Murphy model says about immigration. Instead, they have peddled to the popular myth. When leadership on this question was required in this country the Opposition peddled the popular myth that immigration was a negative for the economy. That argument has probably been lost; as a result, there will probably be a reduction in immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that those people who feel that they have made a contribution to this worthy goal, as they see it, will feel that they have achieved something. But I tell them this: not very much will be achieved for the Australian economy. From a positive point of view, hopefully we will get out of this recession very quickly and restore a reasonable immigration program to this country. I hope that next year, when we are debating this issue, we will be in a position to say that both parties have at least reached agreement to restore immigration to a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude with some comments in relation to the refugee issue. I support the amendments to be moved to strengthen the provisions with respect to refugees. I have made it clear to the Minister that I support those provisions in the following context: it is very important for us to send a message overseas that we will not tolerate people simply arriving here on the basis of trying to jump the refugee queues. That message is fair enough; I approve of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations has taken evidence in relation to what happened to the Cambodian people in the first two or three boat groups. I have said this in another place; I repeat it here: I am absolutely appalled that these people had to wait for such a long time before their applications even went in. I know that the majority of the fault lay with the people who were advising the would-be refugees. Some of those lawyers and other people were delaying the process in the hope that the longer the refugees stayed in detention the better would be their chances of staying in Australia. That was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that we as a society, seeing this process taking place, could have taken more action. We, as a society, could have said, `Look, these people are in detention for this period; how about we do something?'. And we did do something. The Minister tried to do something shortly after taking office. The lawyers then went to court and delayed the process even further. There was further delay for these refugees when the Minister was trying to process the matter quickly. Those people who are critical of the actions of the Minister are mistaken. If they look at the totality of the Minister's actions, they will see that he tried to get this processing done as quickly as possible, but the delays that kept occurring in the courts have contributed to the suffering by these people. It is important that we take that on board. We must make sure that that does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To prevent that happening again, the Committee recommended a change to the regulations to ensure that persons arriving illegally now must get their forms in within 28 days. That is very important. We do not want a repeat of what happened with those three Cambodian boat groups. We want the applications by these people to go in quickly and have them looked at. They will have a fair go during examination by departmental officials and later if they want to go to the Refugee Status Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, this process should have been put in place earlier, but unfortunately we could not do it earlier. I am very happy that the process is now in place so that everyone's claim can be considered as quickly as possible. Once the claims are either accepted or rejected by the relevant bodies, those people can either be asked to leave Australia or accepted into the fold as permanent residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee will shortly be presenting a report on the refugee situation and all those issues will be discussed. It is important to emphasise that we have to get this process right in relation to our international obligations to genuine refugees and our obligations towards ensuring that the integrity of the immigration program is protected. The amendments to be moved by the Minister today and those moved on previous occasions are very important in achieving that goal. </PARA>

Firstly, let me thank those honourable members who took part in this debate&mdash;the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and, of course, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of points were made which I would like briefly to address. Firstly, there was an offer of assistance in the next stage, which I alluded to in the very carefully crafted second reading speech. The reason for that careful approach is, I think, known to honourable members in terms of the status that speech has in proceedings that may occur in places other than here. I take seriously that offer by the Opposition and other members who took part in the debate to assist in the next stage of looking at this whole question. I can assure the shadow Minister that&mdash;as we have already had at least, I think, two meetings on this question leading up to this urgent amendment that we are putting through today&mdash;I intend to have a number of other meetings with him as we proceed towards the Budget session. I would also like to thank him for the Opposition's agreement to the proposed amendment to this issue that is before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to the honourable member for Calwell, before he goes, that I will not be as flamboyant in my response to him this evening as I was the other night. I would not do that in here and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, probably would not let me get away with it. It is an interesting tape. Let me say this: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>as I have said before, there are a lot of experts in immigration. I have never necessarily claimed to be one. I try to get things right. I have the interests of the applicants and the interests of the nation at heart when I make these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps when this saga of the current boat people is concluded, I will have my day to relay what has occurred in this whole process. I want to allude to one point that the honourable member for Calwell made. It is unfortunate that this has taken so long. I think the point that I made on a television program about how I had been conned by people was missed by a member of the Opposition who used it in an earlier debate. My motive for being scrupulously fair was to ensure that the Cambodians, the PRCs and the few Vietnamese who happen to be in custody at this point got the fairest possible opportunity to present their case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal procedures prevent me from elaborating on what, in fact, occurred. But let there be no mistake&mdash;I have the interests of this nation in mind. I go back to an earlier debate today where I said, `Where I have the ability and control over matters that I am concerned with, I will be scrupulously fair and firm'. The problem is that I have not always had that ability or control over certain things. Where I have control I will be fair, but firm, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Cambodians, I repeat again in this chamber that I do not accept fault in terms of the slowness of this processing by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the officers or necessarily by me&mdash;but I am secondary. I am fed up with people having a go at the Department and the officers that work tirelessly in extraordinarily difficult situations, particularly regarding these boat people, where they cannot defend themselves, they cannot come in here or they cannot go to the media because of some legal constraint or some threat of legal action by some slick lawyer. It is a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I make the plea to the community that we are trying to process these people quickly, and we will. But the process is going to be adhered to. Let everybody understand&mdash;lawyer, churchman, citizen and applicant&mdash;that there will be no deviating by anybody from the process. This is the first time that I have had the chance in here to say that. All the pressure, all the deceit and all the manipulation is not going to make me shift one centimetre in terms of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give two examples. First, a woman was shown on television stumbling out of a car. She was encouraged to run to the fence to embrace her son through the wire. But the departmental officers had made arrangements to have the gate open 50 yards down the road so that the car could drive in and she could embrace her son in a proper way. But that was not good television; that was not good copy. People not associated with the Department at Port Hedland were appalled at the behaviour of the TV crew trying to entice this unfortunate woman faced with this dilemma to be used for a cheap shot. Secondly, a bishop goes on television and alleges that the Department and I are engaged in some sort of compulsory abortion process, and then he carefully backs away. That is another outrageous lie&mdash;bishop or no bishop. That was never going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the things that will come out, but there will be no shifting or moving away. I will defend my officers vigorously because I have worked closely with them. Everybody had better be on notice. We are acting in the best interests of this nation and the applicants. I expect support for that. But I will not be pressured by anybody where I am in control of it. What others do is another matter, and I can be hung for that too&mdash;and I have been in both portfolios, I suspect. But in this situation where we are in control of it, we are going to end up with the best process in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press can have its cheap shots and honourable members can have their cheap shots, but few of them I suspect have any real understanding of how complex and difficult this whole thing is. The fact that we are dealing with people's lives does not make the job very easy. We are subject to all the experts, all the advice and, as I say, all the manipulation. But we are not shifting, and both sides of the House should make no mistake about it. I will leave the job before I engage in a manipulation or sleight of hand of this process. So the House had better be on notice about that. It is not going to be done. I have the first opportunity perhaps to defend myself and my officers from the constant barrage of misinformation and cheap shots that have been portrayed in the media over a period of time. It is not going to be tolerated any more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and related legislation introduces a new system of compulsory superannuation into Australia. It is precisely because of the word `compulsion' that the Opposition's amendment calls on the House to withdraw this legislation, which would introduce a compulsory superannuation scheme for Australians. Following the revelations contained in recent Treasury evidence to the Senate inquiry into superannuation, it is clear that there are no economic, financial or social justifications for the Government's proposals which, if implemented, would cause even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills are designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the 1991-92 Budget to impose a non-tax deductible levy on employers who fail to provide superannuation support at a minimum percentage level of employee's earnings, which would automatically and progressively increase over time to reach at least 9 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in this new regime ultimately will complement, but not replace, award superannuation. In fact, it will introduce a complex four-tiered process. We have award superannuation; employer-funded superannuation schemes; personal schemes, such as 23FC; and, finally, we have the superannuation guarantee scheme, which is also built into this legislation. Is it any wonder that we therefore tell the Government that it is introducing at this stage yet another level of massive complexity and cost at the very time the Australian employers, as well as employees, do not need additional restrictions on the capacity to employ?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Opposition is concerned, this is not a bona fide retirement incomes proposal. It is, in effect, an attempt to use retirement income to solve what is nothing more nor less than an industrial relations problem relating to the ACTU and the implementation of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Award superannuation was introduced in 1986 when the Industrial Relations Commission agreed to sanction consent awards requiring the payment of 3 per cent of wages into specified funds. In most cases, these were nominated union-sponsored industry funds agreed upon by unions and employer representatives. Trustees were made up of representatives of both of these groups, but no trustees represented the interests of the employees themselves, nor were they ever appointed or elected by those employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, therefore, this new procedure was introduced in 1986 without any consultation with the Australian work force. The decision applied only to Federal awards so that employees with no award coverage, or those that were covered by State awards, were not covered by the decision. Despite the fact that there had been a relatively high level of non-compliance&mdash;in fact, according to Senator Cook, it is currently running at the rate of some $700m a year&mdash;in the run-up to the 1990 election, the Government announced that it would support an ACTU application for a second round of 3 per cent award superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to expectations, in its April 1991 national wage case judgment, the IRC refused to approve the application and, instead, recommended that the Government should convene a national conference on superannuation and, more generally, on retirement incomes policy. Not unreasonably, the business community of Australia and the Opposition welcomed that recommendation. Regrettably, the Government refused to debate the issues in public and ultimately decided to reject the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, we have had the establishment of a Senate inquiry, which has already uncovered considerable, very interesting information. This underlines precisely the purpose of the Opposition, which is to condemn and oppose this legislation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established by the coalition and the Australian Democrats to put pressure on the Government to convene a national conference. As I have said, at least to date, that has been to no avail. Nevertheless, the Government simply announced its support for a compulsory scheme to give the ACTU, effectively, by the back door what the Industrial Relations Commission had refused to give it by the front door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Business Council of Australia has pointed out, employers are being compelled to fund a system which has more to do with holding the accord together than developing a genuine retirement incomes policy for Australia. In social policy terms, the Opposition is of the view that a genuine and worthwhile retirement incomes policy, in the context of a greying Australia, is undoubtedly one of the most important areas of social policy to which this Government should address itself far more than it has. </PARA>

It is also scheduled to start from 1 July this year, despite the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has now committed the Government to the release of a White Paper before the end of the present financial year. Surely, that White Paper will canvass a number of fundamental issues. No doubt it will also consider in detail our retirement income policy, which is on the table. This is something that this Government has failed to compete with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It particularly has to consider whether there should be a cap on lump sums, whether annuities ought to be more freely available and whether the reasonable benefits limit regime should be replaced by a nominal cap. If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>of 6 April 1992 is to be taken at face value, it would appear that the Government is looking very seriously at having a cap of $375,000 on concessionally taxed lump sum superannuation pay-outs, and that it also intends to install a flat 15 per cent rebate for all employees' superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I found particularly interesting was the suggestion that the Government may be looking at a proposal to introduce what it calls superannuation retirement accounts. In our 1986 policy we announced that the Opposition parties would have retirement savings accounts. If they emerge, at least something will have been achieved. One of the fundamental failures of the Government policy is that it has been grossly unfair to women, and particularly to part time workers, the vast majority of whom are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group of welfare, women's and community groups, including ACOSS, AFCO, ACOTA, AFB&amp;PW and AP&amp;SF, as well as the Association of Civilian Widows, WEL and WIN, wrote to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), in October 1991 and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would regard it as completely unacceptable if the major anomalies, inequities and inefficiencies. . . were not addressed prior to further entrenching the current system in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>However, as usual, the Government has chosen to ignore the views of that very important group of people. At a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, senior Treasury officials poured water on the alleged justification for compulsory superannuation by admitting that they were not in possession of any information which would support the usual arguments for such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, in his second reading speech on this legislation, emphasised that the very fundamental purpose of the Bill was to overcome two major problems: firstly, the need to boost national savings; and, secondly, the need to arrest the rising costs of age pensions. The Senate evidence, which has come from the Treasury, makes it quite clear that there is no substance in either of the arguments which have so far come forward in that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the legislation to be introduced on 1 July 1991, in respect of the 1992-93 financial year, will affect employers with annual payrolls of more than half a million dollars. They will be required to contribute 5 per cent of each employee's earnings, up to a maximum level of $80,000, to any complying fund. That represents a contribution cap of some $4,000 a year per employee. The point should be emphasised that we are far more generous than the Government in this area, because we have a contribution cap of $6,000 per employee. In addition, we will provide a further $6,000 to support, in superannuation terms, wives and spouses of employees&mdash;or employers, for that matter. In addition, we are providing a 25 per cent tax rebate on all contributions up to that limit. Overall, the evidence suggests that the changes the Government is ultimately likely to introduce will be very similar to the proposals we have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For employers with payrolls of less than half a million dollars, the prescribed starting rate will be 3 per cent. This rate will rise progressively so that it reaches 9 per cent by the year 2000, and it will be fully employer funded. No contribution from employees is taken account of in these proposals. In addition, a further 3 per cent employee contribution could be considered, taking the prescribed rate to 12 per cent by the year 2000. That has to be negotiated on a basis which will take account of wage trade-offs over that time. Therefore, if the Government policy is applied, the real prospect facing hundreds of thousands of Australian middle- to low-income workers is that they will have very little, if any, increase in wages over that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers who fail to pay the minimum contribution will be required to pay a non-deductible levy to the Taxation Office. So this superannuation guarantee scheme, which I referred to earlier as the mechanism the Government intends to use, is bizarre. Whereas in all other aspects of this proposal employees have no right of choice whatsoever, we are told that under the superannuation guarantee scheme employees will have some degree of choice in relation to the funding of their superannuation contributions, taken on a compulsory basis from their employers. Existing contributions will be able to be offset against the above-mentioned contributions and the amount of the levy will be distributed by the Taxation Office to a superannuation fund for the employees to whom it relates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposals of this nature quite obviously have major macro-economic impacts, especially on employers' capacity to pay. While Australia still suffers from the deepest economic recession in 60 years, with unemployment at over 10 per cent and at least one million Australians out of work&mdash;and there are all sorts of estimates as to the level of underemployment; it could well be half a million&mdash;the last thing businesses need is policies which will undermine further their capacity to expand their enterprises and increase employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the hapless member for Werriwa, when he was Treasurer, was forced to concede publicly that these superannuation changes were essentially and basically an additional cost. This regime will add an extra $3 billion to $4 billion a year to labour costs, irrespective of the state of the international or the domestic economy, let alone the plight of individual employers and those employees who will be unemployed because of these proposals. Even ardent advocates of compulsory superannuation such as National Mutual have been concerned enough to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislated contribution levels make no allowance for the capacity of various employers and industry to meet the requirements. The legislated approach assumes everyone can pay higher rates at the same point in time.</PARA>
<PARA>How absolutely ridiculous it is to suggest that small businesses in particular&mdash;which will be the major losers under these proposals&mdash;are now to be forced to have a further impost on their wages bills, which will make them that much less economic and less able to survive in a very difficult market environment. The impact on small business, where the great bulk of the burden will undoubtedly fall, will therefore be even more severe. The VACC estimates that, for an average award employee, total on-costs will rise from 31.5 per cent to 37 per cent of labour costs, and even more for staff not covered by awards. Like the training guarantee levy, the SGL is a de facto payroll or employment tax, imposed regardless of profitability. But, unlike the TGL, it offers no prospects of productivity improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, once again, the Opposition parties stand in direct contrast to the approach being taken by the Government. We support a voluntary superannuation scheme. We support the removal of all taxes such as payroll taxes. We support employment. We support getting people off the unemployment lists and giving them back the self-respect which employment gives when people can make a contribution to themselves, their families and the nation. That is why we find this legislation so absolutely abhorrent. Against all the evidence from the Treasury, from the Department of Finance, from the private sector, from the superannuation industry itself and from all the major employer organisations, the words are crystal clear: Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that hundreds of thousands of workers are going to lose their jobs because of this. These are not just my words. It is not just the hyperbole of the Opposition; it is the evidence given to the Senate Committee by the Treasury itself, which was referred to in Question Time today. Surely it is the responsibility of the Government&mdash;as we have said in our second reading amendment&mdash;to think again and to re-examine in detail precisely what the implications are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said initially, one of the other purposes of this legislation, according to the Treasurer, is to increase Australian domestic savings. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need to boost national savings in this country. Household savings have more than halved from a peak of about 15 per cent of disposable income in the mid-1970s to just over 6 per cent in 1990-91. But it does not follow that forcing workers to go without wage increases will help the cause. Overseas experience has shown quite conclusively that, unless there is rising output and productivity, compulsory savings in one form will simply lead to a run-down in savings elsewhere in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Treasury has repeated and supported this position. It is particularly conscious of this switching effect. Most of its claims are not in favour of the SGL. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non superannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Treasury went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some substitution . . . can be expected, however. . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available.</PARA>
<PARA>Paddy McGuinness said in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weight of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Or worse still, the real risk is to go into debt. Professor John Freebairn was right when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to providing high income in retirement is the pursuit of policies promoting high economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Those policies should be first and foremost. According to Peter Griffin, Managing Director of Rothschild, a compulsory system is unlikely to increase national savings and will lead to lower returns to savers as well as a big distortion in the allocation of investment capital and the workings of the capital market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the age pension, which is the second objective of the Government in this legislation, is obviously a matter of considerable long term concern to us all. There is no doubt that Australia has a retirement savings problem. Whereas there were 1.9 million people of age pension age in 1984,</PARA>
<PARA>there will be over four million in the year 2021. This translates into a drop in the ratio of Australians of working age to those over 65 from 5:1 to 3:1. However, the increasing cost of pensions with the greying of the population will simply be worsened by maintaining the double-dipping gap which currently exists. The Opposition has had the courage, totally lacking in this Government, to face up to this fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The double-dipping gap has encouraged people to retire early&mdash;to take their entitlements and then qualify for the age pension in due course. What is the outcome of this? Some 77 per cent of people of age pension age are currently receiving a pension at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of more than $12 billion a year. The Government and the ACTU are obviously determined not to close the double-dipping gap. The age pension bill must therefore certainly rise steeply in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in this House has boasted about the great reforms to superannuation which have been introduced since 1986. They have certainly had the effect of increasing taxation on superannuation by over 1,000 per cent and have made millions for people who are trying to explain to those who have superannuation how the new, complex system works. Despite all of that, the Government has totally failed to face up to the fundamental fact that there are real administrative problems here which it must address if its intention to introduce a worthwhile retirement income policy is to have any credibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Moreover, the cost of tax concessions, currently almost $3.5 billion a year, is set to double with the implementation of compulsory superannuation. I would say here that if this Government succeeds in getting in place a totally compulsory superannuation system, it will be only a question of time before the left wing of the Labor Party, those people on the right of the Labor Party and those in the centre of the Labor Party will find all sorts of other ways to spend $3.5 billion of forgone revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response will be crystal clear. The Government will simply say, `We've got everybody caught now. They're in our compulsory system. We will now proceed to whittle away the tax deductabilities and remove the incentives to go into superannuation, because the people now have no choice whatsoever.' The people will have no choice about not only where their superannuation should go but also whether they should have superannuation at all. That is what we will see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, that is what is at stake in this legislation. The fundamental questions are: what is the hidden agenda of this Labor Party; what are the changes it intends to introduce in the future; and how is it therefore going to establish the very basis of an effective retirement income system? Such a system must surely be based upon two principles: firstly, the capacity of employers to pay; and, secondly, the capacity of individuals to take at least the minimum steps necessary to safeguard themselves in retirement. Regrettably, the Government has failed on both counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us regard again the question of who pays. Unlike every other compulsory system in the world, the superannuation guarantee levy legislation puts the burden entirely on employers, many of whom will be expected to find 12 per cent within eight years. The Government's timetable ostensibly requires employers to pay 9 per cent by the year 2000, but it is clear that they will be expected to pay the last 3 per cent as well. The Government has said only that it will give consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts. But if employees believe&mdash;as they have been encouraged to do by some trade unions and certainly by the Government's approach&mdash;that the overall responsibility for retirement income rests absolutely with employers, of course they will take the easy option. But the question which has to be addressed is: is that the right direction for Australia?  We are firmly of the view that the answer must be no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employer-pays approach will invariably encourage many employees to take the view that superannuation is no longer their responsibility, therefore ensuring the lowest common denominator. The saddest fact of all is that low income Australians and many middle income Australians under the proposed system, may find themselves in the position where they will still qualify for at least part pensions. The principle which the Minister enunciated at the beginning of his remarks about reducing the cost of pensions will be thwarted by the very failure of this legislation to address effectively that fundamental principle. If we want people employed, we must encourage them to contribute to their retirement income. By all means we should continue tax deductions for their contributions, and for employers as well. But it is absurd to suggest that a universal superannuation scheme, especially a compulsory scheme of this nature, will effectively cover all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine who some of the real losers are going to be. I refer specifically, as I did earlier, to part time and casual employees. They will do worst out of a compulsory superannuation system because there are two million of them, mainly women. Not only will they be forced effectively to forgo very substantial wage rises; the amount set aside for them in the name of superannuation will also be decimated by administration, insurance and taxation charges, leaving them with a small cash pittance and effectively no retirement income. </PARA>

There is no evidence to indicate that it will in any way arrest the rising costs of age pensions, which, as I said, are currently $12 billion a year.

The tax will not, of course, be applied if an employer's contributions are paid to the minimum level of an employee's earnings base. The maximum level of the earnings base is $80,000 per annum, indexed annually. The minimum levels of employer contributions are, as set out in the Bill, for employers with a payroll of $500,000 or less, 3 per cent for 1992-93 and 1993-94, rising to 7 per cent by 1997-98 and to 9 per cent by the year 2000. Employers with a payroll of more than half a million dollars will be required to pay 5 per cent in the next two years, 6 per cent in the ensuing two years, rising to 7 per cent in 1996-97, at which point the smaller employers' contribution will have caught up with that of the larger employers and will progress in tandem to 9 per cent by the year 2000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage of the Government's move towards increased superannuation cover for all employees was made in the 1986 national wage case when the decision was that 3 per cent of salary should be paid by employers in superannuation to cover all workers under Federal awards. In 1991 the Industrial Relations Commission, I think mistakenly, refused to extend that 3 per cent to 6 per cent. In the 1991-92 Budget, the Government announced legislation to extend the coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for this decision last year are very easy to see. Firstly, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the original IRC decision, that is, the 1986 award based superannuation decision. Secondly, it is to extend coverage to increase employer support over an extended period. Thirdly, it is meant to reduce the number of future total dependants on social security pensions, to improve living standards for retirees and to reduce outlays from the Budget in future years. Fourthly, it is expected to increase national domestic savings, involving less reliance on foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future. </PARA>

In addition, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last year in its national wage case decision refused the application of the Government and the ACTU for a staged 3 per cent increase to award superannuation. In other words, some employers had failed their employees, and the Industrial Relations Commission had failed the nation in its decision inasmuch as its decision did not increase award superannuation by 3 per cent staged over a number of years. </PARA>

In the year 2031 that same category is projected to increase to 5 million or 20 per cent of the population. The ratio of those working to those retired in June 1991 was 5.5:1; in June 2031 it will be only 3:1.

Nevertheless, commonsense dictates that there will be savings. Given similar income and assets tests in real terms, only 30 to 40 per cent reduced eligibility would be required for age pensions to effect a saving of between $4.4 billion and $6.6 billion in 1991-92 dollars. </PARA>

The conclusion that one draws is this: One Nation forecasts will be met regarding low inflation and external account projections through the 1990s, but I am very doubtful about us meeting the 4 per cent plus GDP and job growth projections. But there will be a recovery, even if it is only a modest one, and with that recovery will come increases in demand. Australia will require increased savings to fund increased investment, so there will be less reliance upon foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future. We would then avoid the higher interest rates which come with the need to attract foreign capital in ever increasing amounts. In other words, with increased savings, we would have lower real interest rates and probably a lower dollar, which will benefit exports and import replacement industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: what will be the extent of these savings if we implement universal superannuation? Again, I deeply regret the absence of Treasury projections, but still we can make some commonsense general assessments. Firstly, we need to understand that the employer contributions are a substitute for wage increases that would otherwise have been achieved. Secondly, it is reasonable to assume that future wage increases probably will not exceed CPI increases. If the consumer price index projections are low in the 1990s, as I believe they will be&mdash;in a 2.5 to 3.5 per cent range&mdash;and the mean increase to the superannuation contributions effected by this legislation is about 7.5 per cent over that time, then I expect the extent to which wage increases are substituted by contributions to superannuation will be about 33 per cent of the total wage increases that would otherwise have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: would this have been saved if it had been taken in wages? The answer is, `Of course not', and I say that to the Opposition. We have only to look at the decline in the general percentage of savings to GDP in the private sector, which I just mentioned, to understand that. The best guesstimate of the increase in savings could come from comparing the current growth in accumulating superannuation investment portfolios with the estimates of growth if we legislate general superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the funds are increasing by about $5 billion in their investment portfolio per quarter. At that rate they would reach about $300 billion, if nothing was done, by about the year 2000 AD. But we expect that if something is done, such as this legislation, investment by the funds would increase to between $450 billion and $600 billion. So there is every chance that, as a result of what we are doing, accumulated investment by the funds will increase by between $150 billion to $300 billion by the year 2000 AD as a result of the move to universal compulsory superannuation through the private sector. This is a very important step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there is an element of compulsion in all of this&mdash;and certainly there is&mdash;and an element of wage substitution, the Government must impose more stringent prudential supervision than exists at present and it must consider again the question of investment controls. Currently the Government and the industry oppose investment controls. I believe they should think again. Surely Australians will expect a maximum effort from the funds to stimulate domestic growth; that is, jobs for the workers who invest in the funds, their children and their grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 18 months to December 1991 overseas assets invested by superannuation funds rose from 11.7 per cent to 14.5 per cent; that is, to $21.3 billion as it stands now. There should be a future portfolio limit of 20 per cent on funds, invested outside Australia by superannuation funds. This could be achieved via the tax system. I say that without fear of contradiction by the Australian workers. A further issue is this: the majority of investments of the major funds&mdash;and most of the minor ones&mdash;are in either property, bonds or blue chip shares to the detriment of new growth industries. Superannuation funds and approved development funds outside life assurance offices investing directly now have 18 per cent of their portfolio in land and buildings as at December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMP Society out of a total $53 billion investment has $11.2 billion in property and, of $7.6 billion in Australian listed ordinary shares, most are old established blue chip. There is no adventure, no foresight for investment in the so-called brave new world in Australian industry. If one runs one's eye down its annual report one sees the investment in shares, in building materials, food and household goods, property trusts, chemicals, engineering, paper and packaging, retail, transport, media and banks, but unfortunately one does not see very much investment in some of the so-called new growth in value added export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rejection by the Government of investment controls up to this time, I think we should consider requiring a small percentage, say 3 per cent or so, of portfolio investments by funds over an agreed threshold size to be made in certain designated growth industries. This could also be achieved via the tax system. Three per cent of accumulated growth by 2,000 AD could generate domestic equity in such industries to about $10 billion. That would be a very important step forward for future employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the need for improved prudential supervision. This matter is covered by the statement put out by the former Treasurer last year and by the report of the Law Reform Commission released recently. It goes without saying that the prudential supervision situation as it stands at present is not nearly stringent enough. There is support in this report from the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee for a whole range of new prudential requirements. I support most of them, but I do not support the recommendation regarding no investment controls whatsoever, and I have doubts about the recommendation which restricts the insurance by these funds of benefits to members simply to advice for insurance against fraud and negligence. Frankly, I do not think that goes far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be, in effect, a national superannuation scheme involving compulsory contributions totally invested in the private sector in a multiplicity of funds and we will be the only single nation in the world that has national compulsory superannuation with the investment in the private sector not guaranteed and not insured. Most of the international compulsory national funds, of course, are run by the Government and guaranteed by the Government. In the absence of government guarantees or insurance of benefits by the funds, insurance against fraud and negligence should be mandatory and not simply a piece of advice to each of the single funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish we could accommodate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), and come to terms with the legislation the Government has placed before the Parliament but, unfortunately, in his and earlier remarks from that side there have not been any compelling reasons for doing that. The superannuation guarantee levy was announced in the 1991-92 Budget and is intended to come into effect from 1 July of this year. The levy provided for in these Bills aims to reinforce the existing award superannuation arrangements by extending superannuation coverage to as much of the work force as possible, which has, of course, been the Government's stated objective for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the superannuation guarantee scheme, the Taxation Office will collect revenue from employers who do not provide a minimum level of superannuation coverage for their employees. These revenue collections will then be redistributed to complying superannuation schemes for the benefit of those employees for whom the Government deems inadequate superannuation support has been provided. These distributions will have the administrative costs of running the superannuation guarantee levy deducted from them. So super funds will not fully benefit from the extent of the Australian Taxation Office's collections on behalf of employees. Administrative costs are expected to be in the vicinity of $130 per person, and that should not be overlooked. It should also be noted that many part time and casual employees on whose behalf these funds are collected will never derive any benefit from these distributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most odious feature of the superannuation guarantee levy is that it will apply to all employers regardless of their individual capacity to pay. The prescribed minimum level of employer superannuation support to apply from 1 July 1992 will be 5 per cent of earnings for employees of employers which have annual payrolls larger than $500,000 and 3 per cent of earnings for all other employees. The Government will eventually increase the prescribed minimum level of superannuation support to 9 per cent for all employees by the year 2000, with the Government leaving open to itself the option of increasing that level to 12 per cent of earnings within this timeframe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although award superannuation will count towards the prescribed minimum level of superannuation support, employers will still need to fulfil all of their award obligations to employees, with particular regard to award-based superannuation. Employers in default of their award superannuation obligations will still need to satisfy those obligations, even if they have paid the superannuation guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By all accounts, the superannuation guarantee levy will have a disastrous impact on business in Australia. This levy will need to be paid out of companies' profits or retained earnings or on top of wages. They are the only three sources of the levy.

One actuarial firm has gone so far as to describe the legislation as currently drafted as deficient and shoddy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers will need to begin complying with the superannuation guarantee levy from 1 July this year, but, as yet, there is no certainty as to the final form the legislation will take. The Australian Democrats have been making noises about what they perceive to be the inadequacies of the legislation as currently drafted. The State and Territory governments have just launched a major attack on this legislation, based on the Federal Government's failure to consult with them on its implementation and on the financial burden that it will place on State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do employers lack the firm legislative basis on which they might proceed to implement the levy, but also they lack the accompanying regulations, the details of which have not been provided to this Parliament. As far as we know, they have not even been prepared by the Government. All this adds up to considerable uncertainty, which is compounded by the confusion over how this scheme will interact with existing and prospective award based superannuation arrangements. This uncertainty will result in many small and large firms making expensive mistakes in the discharge of their obligations under the superannuation guarantee scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee levy reflects the failure of the Government's retirement incomes policy over its nine long years in office. It is designed to redress the massive non-compliance on the part of employers with the terms of award superannuation and the failure of the Government to make superannuation an attractive option for employees without access to award based superannuation. It also reflects the refusal of the Industrial Relations Commission to endorse the second-round 3 per cent increase in award superannuation as sought by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IRC has refused further increases in award superannuation without the Government taking further steps to clarify the role of award superannuation and in its approach to wages and retirement incomes policy. The IRC recognises that the Government is deficient in those areas. The Government has for some time now expressed its preference for superannuation to act as Australia's main savings vehicle and is the foundation of its retirement incomes policy. It has therefore sought to extend the scope and level of superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Having failed to secure these objectives through award superannuation and through generous tax concessions for superannuation fund contributors, the Government is now seeking to coerce employees and employers into meeting the Government's preferred level of superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to extend the coverage of superannuation to include most of the work force, however, the Government has shown a complete disregard for the quality of that coverage. In particular, it seems that the level of superannuation support for employees to be provided under the superannuation guarantee levy will be inadequate to meet either their retirement needs or to reduce Australia's age pension bill in the short to medium term. Even if the superannuation guarantee levy reaches the upper range of 12 per cent of earnings that the Government has flagged as a possibility by the year 2000, it is unlikely that many workers would be completely disqualified from receipt of the age pension without having made substantial additional contributions of their own to their superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates of the level of contribution needed to sustain a pension-free retirement vary considerably, as we all know, but it is clear that the superannuation guarantee levy is unlikely to make a significant dent in Australia's age pension bill in the years to come. It is generally considered necessary for a worker to put away 12 per cent of his or her income over 35 to 40 years in order to be able to retire on a benefit equal to 50 per cent of average weekly earnings. So it will be at least 50 years before the superannuation levy has a major impact on the age pension bill in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recently revealed in hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that neither the Treasury nor the Tax Office had made any attempt to calculate whether the superannuation guarantee levy would reduce the Commonwealth's pension bill or increase national savings in the next century. This is in sharp contrast, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know only too well, to the detailed analysis the Treasury has performed on the impact of the Opposition's superannuation proposals in the Fightback package and up to the year 1996. At the present time it seems that the Treasury is more interested in modelling coalition policy than in further developing Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These revelations have now forced the Government to rather belatedly set up a task force to model the effects of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Government superannuation policy on the Australian economy. But this has not stopped the Government proceeding with this lamentable set of Bills. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government's attempts to extend the coverage of superannuation as widely as possible are having perverse effects on Australia's national savings effort. The proportion of national savings held by life offices has increased dramatically in recent years, but only at the expense of other savings vehicles. In fact, the household savings ratio has fallen considerably in recent years to around about 4 per cent, and it is continuing to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, many people are using superannuation as a substitute for, rather than a complement to, their personal savings for retirement. Indeed, why should people provide for their own retirement when they are under the deliberately imparted impression that the Government has done this for them through award superannuation and the superannuation levy? It promises the kind of Medicare levy mentality whereby many in this country still think that that impost&mdash;the Medicare levy&mdash;covers all health costs. That is what the Government is repeating here again; it will create a mind set which will cost this country dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can mandate minimum levels of employer superannuation support for employees until it is blue in the face, but it will not succeed in increasing the overall level of savings in this country, which is widely recognised as one of our major economic problems. The massive flow of funds into superannuation may also have the effect of reducing incentives to fund managers to maximise returns on contributors' funds. With award based superannuation and now the superannuation guarantee levy ensuring that superannuation fund managers are in receipt of a guaranteed flow of funds to manage, there will be less competition from other savings vehicles to keep superannuation fund managers on their toes. In other words, there will be an absence of normal competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor motivating the Government in its imposition of this levy is that the taxation regime and the administration arrangements that the Government has established for superannuation have failed to provide incentives to low income earners and many others in the work force to take out superannuation. In fact, they contain many positive disincentives. The tax concessions that the Government has made available for superannuation, which cost the revenue some $3.35 billion in 1989-90, have acted as a tax shelter for the well-off, at the cost to revenue that may very well be greater than the prospective cost of providing the age pension to beneficiaries under these arrangements; it might very well exceed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current taxation arrangements for superannuation a person paying the top marginal personal income tax rate obtains a tax break of 33.25c in the dollar from superannuation tax concessions. By contrast, a person on the lowest marginal tax rate gets a tax break of only 5c in the dollar or 6.25c if the Medicare levy is payable. Yet it is these people whom we most want to encourage to provide for their retirement. Many high income earners have been able to claim individual tax deductions for superannuation contributions in excess of $100,000 per annum, resulting in tax benefits in excess of $33,000 a year for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inequities generated by the current arrangements for superannuation are not just the result of the skewed nature of the tax benefits that they confer. The enormous complexity of current superannuation taxation and administrative arrangements also discriminates heavily against low income earners. This was something that was recently conceded by Treasury officials in evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Treasury officials then noted that the current complexity in the administration and taxation of superannuation serves to reduce the benefits payable to contributors, acting again as a deterrent for low income earners to take out superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Government first assumed office, there was only one tax on superannuation; today there are six such taxes. This Government has increased taxation on superannuation savings by 1,000 per cent. These imposts include a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions, a 15 per cent tax on the income of funds, a 16.25 per cent tax on lump sums, a 21.25 per cent tax on lump sums for people under 55, the pre-1983 tax arrangements and the application of capital gains tax on superannuation fund assets. That is not a bad collection. We are one of the few countries in the world to tax superannuation at virtually every level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these taxes, we have the reasonable benefits limit which is both complicated and costly to administer.

However, the Labor Government's hard work in the area has ensured that a whole new generation of ordinary Australians&mdash;not the rich and famous or whatever they want to call themselves and the management people&mdash;has been given an opportunity to prepare for their own retirement and to give themselves greater independence in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This significant achievement would not have been possible without the cooperative atmosphere that has existed in the industrial relations system over the past decade and the constructive role that the trade union movement has played within that system. The union movement has played an important role in the realisation of many of the superannuation benefits now afforded to the workers of this country. Of course, the coalition has made no contribution whatsoever. All it wants to do is to tear down those things that we have tried to do for the Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only via this consultative process between government, business and organised labour that genuine improvements can be made to the overall wage outcome for our workers.

It is no wonder that there is widespread concern within the superannuation and insurance industry at the prospect of a Liberal Party government led by the Leader of the Opposition coming to power. Of course, I am sure that Australians are smart enough to realise the dangers of letting that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the superannuation guarantee levy, which will be introduced with the passage of these Bills&mdash;I hope that the coalition and the Democrats will give the legislation that passage that it justly deserves&mdash;is to ensure that all Australian employees will be able to enjoy a certain minimum standard level of income when they retire. This retirement income will be made available through encouraging the private sector to play its part in providing for retirement through such measures as superannuation, and through the public sector and its social security system for those still not covered by superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of award based superannuation to large sections of the work force has done much to increase the role played by the private sector in the provision of a secure retirement income for its workers. The superannuation guarantee levy legislation will be a further important step in this process. It will result in the level of employer contributions to retirement income being increased over time, with the economy's capacity to pay being taken into account&mdash;a very responsible action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, where employers fail to meet their superannuation obligations to employees, the Australian Taxation Office will impose a levy on the employer involved. These funds will then be passed back to the employees through payments to the relevant superannuation funds for the employees for whom inadequate superannuation provision has been made. In effect, the superannuation guarantee levy will result in a minimum acceptable level of superannuation support for every Australian worker. Employers will be able to provide superannuation support for their employees by any superannuation scheme which complies with occupational superannuation arrangements and related regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will in no way affect employers' existing award superannuation responsibilities to their employees. The superannuation guarantee levy will apply to every Australian employer, with individual employers being exempt in relation to only a few limited categories of employees. For the moment, the self-employed will not have to be bound by the conditions of the levy as they are assumed to be making sufficient arrangements for their own retirement income. This is not to say that the levy will not be extended to this group if that is found to be necessary at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be four major categories of employees who will be exempt from the provisions of this legislation. These include employees who are not resident in Australia, employees who are under the age of 18 years and not working in full time employment with one employer, employees who are receiving income that is exempt from income tax under section 23S of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and employees whose income from the one employer is less than $3,000 in one financial year and less than $300 in any week during that financial year. The exemption for casual employees under the age of 18 is a consequence of the fact that such employees are very unlikely to accrue superannuation of any significant amount. If the superannuation guarantee levy were to be applied to such employees, a large number of small contributions would be required with high administrative costs resulting for both business and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the levy will have the effect of replacing some employees' personal superannuation arrangements with employer sponsored schemes. This is necessary to ensure that all employers give their employees a minimum level of superannuation support. This levy is in no way meant to replace award based superannuation arrangements which have become particularly widespread over recent years. It may be possible that employers have not satisfied their award obligations in spite of having paid the levy. Such employers will still have to comply with existing award compliance mechanisms. This legislation will not alter the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's existing ability to intervene in disputes relating to superannuation. The improvements that have occurred in the area of superannuation will, of course, be an important factor in any future wage negotiations with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant improvements that have occurred in superannuation of recent times would be greatly undermined by the coalition's proposals in this area were they ever to be introduced. The coalition parties, of course, have never really understood, as I said earlier, or accepted the need to increase Australia's national savings pool. As a consequence, they have never come up with any workable proposals in this area. This is because they are still trapped by the same outdated thinking that superannuation is solely the preserve of the rich, of those in management positions, and definitely is not for those in low to middle income areas. </PARA>

Today, these figures have risen to 72 per cent for the work force as a whole, with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 78.5 per cent of female workers now covered by some form of superannuation&mdash;something that this Government is justly proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's draconian proposals for the superannuation industry would do much to undermine the advances that have been made. The Leader of the Opposition's superannuation policy seeks to limit contributions to $6,000 a year, and to set a ceiling of $300,000 on lump sum payouts. This would mean that most people would be forced to take part of their payouts in the form of a self-funded pension. He is also seeking to increase the tax rate on fund earnings from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. So much for the dribble from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) before, and what he was saying about taxation on superannuation funds. The Opposition would actually increase it by 10 per cent. Of course, we do not take into consideration the effects the GST will have on all employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying principle of the coalition's superannuation policy is that people should not be forced to save for their retirement. The aim of the policy is to encourage savings through the provision of tax concessions. And we know who benefits most from tax concessions&mdash;it is always the people on higher incomes. However, the overwhelming evidence suggests that this approach will not work. An analysis undertaken by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, quoted in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Review</EMPHASIS>, found:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no country where the provision of tax concessions has resulted in the general population saving more.</PARA>
<PARA>And yet this is the savings model which the coalition is seeking to introduce in Australia. In relation to the overall effect of the changes to taxation arrangements for superannuation that would flow from the Fightback package, the ASFA study also found:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's proposals reduce current concessions by more than half.</PARA>

<PARA>What a great sort of policy that is. I wonder where we got that one from. It is little wonder that the Liberal Party's proposals for superannuation have come in for considerable criticism from within the industry. Such criticism is typified by the remarks of the Chief Executive of North Broken Hill, Mr Peter Wade. Mr Wade recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation is developing as our most important savings medium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition should have a policy that makes it possible for that savings pool to grow very large.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need those savings to help fund economic growth in this country and it makes no sense to set limits on the amount people can put into long-term savings.</PARA>
<PARA>Other people have come forward with comments but I will not go into that tonight. Rather than any concrete proposals for ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their level of income, are covered by some form of superannuation support, the Opposition continues to mouth the same free market slogans about allowing greater choice for individual employers. In the place of the ordered and structured system of award based superannuation, the Opposition proposes a confused system of individual and employer funded superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undermining of the great advances that have been made in the area of superannuation is all in the name of not forcing Australians to save for their retirement. Well, what a negative thing that would be. Rather than being an incentive, the tax changes proposed by those opposite in the area of superannuation would provide a huge disincentive to savings. In the cause of some vague free market ideology, the Liberal Party is prepared to see a reduction in the important role played in recent years by superannuation in increasing the national savings pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through earlier reforms by this Government, such as dividend imputation, incentives have been given for superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies, Australian products and Australian ideas. Via the process of award based superannuation, average Australians are being given the foundations for greater independence when they enter retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to plan ahead for the multitude of changes that will face Australia into the next century. This has not only become the Government's hallmark in the area of retirement incomes; it has also stood it apart clearly from those members opposite. Its goal has been to strike the correct balance between income adequacy for those in need and incentives for all Australians to maximise their retirement incomes. This legislation which will put in place the superannuation guarantee levy will be a further important step in encouraging the growth of superannuation as a form of savings in this country. I am very pleased to be able to stand here tonight and support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is starting to believe the Government's propaganda in relation to superannuation. Firstly, I would make the point that he places great emphasis on the employer making the contribution. As we all know, the Government's proposition will not provide real superannuation for retirement. He raises the point of those higher income earners who receive greater tax concessions. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) addressed that problem and we address it in Fightback. The Government's proposals do not address that issue. The honourable member for Oxley skated around that issue without any positive alternative. The Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill seek to impose an extra charge on employers&mdash;the very point that the honourable member for Oxley does not fully understand&mdash;who fail to meet the new standards of superannuation support that the Government has set out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to begin in a different way to other speakers and have a look at the practice in other overseas nations. Most governments regard retirement incomes as a very important area, because the policies that guide individuals through their working lives impact so heavily on government expenditure when members of the community reach their early sixties. A number of the more prosperous, or in some cases fast growing nations, are sometimes held up as models for Australia. These countries often ensure that there is a clear link between the level of superannuation contributions made by the employee and the amount the employer puts in&mdash;the very point that the honourable member for Oxley fails to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Switzerland makes both employers and employees contribute 4.8 per cent of total earnings to a pension fund. Austria has a contribution level of 12.25 per cent for employers and 10.25 per cent for employees, noting that both parties are contributing. The economic powerhouse of Japan is a country where social pension contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. In South Korea, which has been recording a GDP growth rate in excess of Australia, the present contributions are 1.5 per cent for the employer and employee. The Malaysian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of 7 per cent per annum until the turn of the century. In that nation employees pay 9 per cent and employers pay 11 per cent, maintaining the nexus between those two groups. Australia now proposes to go against what these other economically successful nations practise. Even more importantly, these Bills are not in the individual economic interest of Australia, especially with the nation being in its worst recession in 60 years&mdash;a recession that we had to have, as is so well known by members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have many concerns about these Bills, with the massive 74 points in the explanatory memoranda, and the most important effect it has on the levels of employment. I also note that in Singapore over the past few years the country's Central Provident Fund has been gradually extended. That particular scheme now has a level of contributions from the employer of 15 per cent, but a much higher payment from the employee of 23 per cent. The most salient point is that during the mid-1980s, when there was a recession, the Government allowed a reduction in the level of contributions from the employers, a completely different situation to what we have in this country, where the Government during a recession is asking the employers to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should compare the Singaporean scheme with the moves in this Bill by the Keating Government to impose further compulsory superannuation contributions on the employers, no matter what the individual company's circumstances are, let alone what the national circumstances are. Perhaps that is why Singapore has advanced economically relative to Australia. This Keating Government now proposes to load onto employers an additional cost with little thought as to the consequences. The honourable member for Oxley showed no consideration for job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy offers little, if any, prospect of the employers being able to negotiate offsetting productivity agreements. Interestingly, as the honourable member for Curtin mentioned in his speech, a deputy secretary of the Treasury recently let the cat out of the bag when he commented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that these extra superannuation benefits to employees would be partly funded by cancellation or a reduction in wage increases. The Committee made the observation; it has the understanding that there will be an offset on genuine wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this what individual Australians want? I would have thought that most employees want the freedom to choose what they themselves do with their after-tax earnings. Many employees under the age of 35 may wish to pay off their mortgages more quickly rather than have access to increased superannuation. However, this Bill will deny them that option, because their real earnings will decline over the next eight years if Australians are forced to accept these superannuation increases as a substitute for wage increases. That is the thrust of the ACTU policy. Bill Kelty and the Prime Minister, in advocating that point of view, have on the record made  superannuation a substitute for wage increases, either implicitly or up front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second largest provider of superannuation to Australians is the National Mutual Life Association. I would expect that, like other insurance companies, it is broadly in favour of any measure that would improve its revenue, as this Bill will do over the next eight years. However, National Mutual has made the following comment about this Bill&mdash;and I ask honourable members to note that this is not coming from the Opposition or any industry group of employers unconnected with the superannuation industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislated contribution levels make no allowance for the capacity of various employers and industry to meet the requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">assumes everyone can pay higher rates at the same point in time.</PARA>
<PARA>What a very important observation that is. The Government is presuming that every business in Australia will be equally as profitable. That last proposition, which is enshrined in the legislation, is an absurd proposition, as every businessman knows. For instance, in Victoria the construction industry is at a much lower ebb than food processors&mdash;although I note that Pacific Dunlop Ltd, with its Edgell closures in recent days, commented on Australia's lack of competitiveness and said that its rationalisation was not as a result of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill, the Government suggests that every employer has an equal capacity to pay superannuation, which is the very point that I am making. This, of course, is an essential difference between the freedom in the coalition's industrial relations strategy and the compulsion in the Government's policy in both the industrial relations arena and the superannuation arena, where the Government is legislating to force employers to pay superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that individual circumstances vary for employers and business and for employees. No two people have the same fingerprints; no two firms have the same opportunities, level of profits or problems&mdash;although all Australian companies share one thing: some of the burdens imposed upon them by this Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition says that it should be up to employees at each work site to determine their pay and conditions. However, in deference to the administrative difficulty that any removal of this Bill might cause, we will honour the levy in place at the time of the election of a Hewson government, although it will not be increased any further. It is very important for members of this House to note that we will honour any levy that has been legislated for, if by chance the Senate passes this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's low household savings ratio of between 4 and 6 per cent is of great concern, especially when it is compared with the average in many other countries. A good example is Germany, which has a rate of around about the 12 per cent. That is up to three times Australia's pathetic effort to increase its savings ratio. However, there is little evidence that an increase in the flow of superannuation from employers will lead to higher savings from households. It is appropriate for the Government to abandon this legislation. Individuals should be allowed to temporarily withdraw superannuation contributions to pave the way for a deposit on a first house, as the coalition's visionary Fightback package proposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Corangamite, for instance, there are many firms with between 10 and 20 employees which, depending on the levels of salary they pay to their staff, are very close to the $500,000 threshold in this legislation. If they suddenly find themselves to be over the limit, their costs will in the next year suddenly rise from 3 to 5 per cent on the superannuation side. This is just because they move across the threshold owing to some legislative consideration imposed upon them by this Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most businesses in Corangamite are finding it very difficult to hold both sales and profits at the level of last year; hence a sudden and probably unexpected increase in their costs will give them every incentive to dismiss staff. This is the point that the honourable member for Curtin made, that is, that jobs will be at risk because of this impost of the Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxpayers Association represents both business and personal taxpayers. In the light of its public position on the goods and services tax so far, it cannot be accused of being an Opposition stooge. The Australian Taxpayers Association had this comment to make recently in its journal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe Treasurer Dawkins must withdraw his superannuation guarantee bill. It creates an administrative nightmare for every employer . . . down the track, with a 9 per cent requirement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has gone in with an ideological fix because the ACTU&mdash;the `Keltic' club, as perhaps it should be called&mdash;has decided that Australian workers need their bosses to provide a higher level of superannuation contributions and it should be provided, no matter what the consequences are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What justification is there for a requirement within the legislation that, if a business has a shortfall in its superannuation contributions below the stipulated levy, it could have to pay interest on 52 weeks or more of contributions plus an iniquitous administration charge of a flat $50 plus $30 for each employee? That is coercive legislation if ever we have seen it in this House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The many hundreds of young people who are employed by retailers in Geelong, which is in my electorate, will not see any gain from this legislation. It is common for these young people to work on Friday night and Saturday morning and, as 16-year-olds, get paid approximately $55 for their weekly labours. They will be outside the ambit of the superannuation guarantee levy, as are all of those who earn over $250 a month. Each month, the typical 20 to 25 casuals at a supermarket such as Coles in Belmont, in my electorate, will accrue an extra $12 in superannuation benefit. But the administration charge will eat up about $10 of that. So there is $2 left. What a mockery this is of the superannuation that is being proposed by this Government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their extra benefit will be $2 per month, as I have said, which I am sure will set them up for life and increase Australia's household savings&mdash;especially since when each young person leaves after the typical period of two to three years, the benefit will have to be taken in cash as it is under $500. A number of those in the shearing industry and other industries where casuals are employed have commented about the ridiculous nature of the administrative procedures, the compulsory pressure from the award superannuation, and the final outcome which, because of these outrageous arrangements, does not benefit either the employer or the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saddest thing is that, like the large Melbourne and Sydney retailer David Jones, Coles Myer might decide to reduce its 135 casuals by 2 per cent simply because of the introduction of this Bill here tonight. I note that the Australian Taxation Office is already suggesting that it will spend $3.4m this year on promoting this levy, despite the possibility that it might not see the light of day if we can convince the Australian Democrats in the Senate that the points of view we have been putting forward on this side of the House are valid and that Australians will not be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look forward to the Tax Office zealously prosecuting small businessmen or women, as they try to keep on staff members as profitability declines and so neglect to pay the compulsory superannuation demanded under the legislation. When their day of reckoning comes, these businessmen and women might find they cannot afford the interest and the administrative charges which are levied. What will then be the future of thousands of small Australian businesses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU's philosophical position on superannuation is quite interesting. Not so long ago in October 1991, a senior ACTU official, Brian Daley, the assistant secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU does not support the need for a further enquiry into a national retirement incomes strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an interesting position for the ACTU to take. I concur with that, at least for the moment; that is also my position. Mr Daley went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy is well documented and has been for at least two years.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement must have been superseded by some evidence taken at the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation over the past few days. Not only did the Australian Taxation Office and the Commonwealth Treasury not have any figures as to what benefit lower income earners and casuals would derive from this new levy, but also they could not say whether there would be any increase in national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree entirely with the honourable member for Curtin who made the same point. Here we have the Treasury being unable to cost the Government's own proposals in any meaningful manner. These two major government bodies were also unable to say how much in additional tax concessions to superannuation this new impost would cost in terms of government revenue. They could not produce any evidence to back up claims that this Bill would result in a lowering of the number of Australians presently on the age pension. What an indictment on those two bodies; with all of the hype and with all of the power that the Government has bestowed on this proposition, they cannot produce any evidence to say that the liability for future governments will be reduced in the pension area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House must be opposed because it adds to the cost structure of all Australian business. Australia should instead be reducing business costs by $20 billion. The coalition's Fightback package will achieve this. We will reduce that cost; our position has been well documented. With the abolition of payroll tax, we are getting rid of a tax&mdash;unlike this superannuation tax. We propose to abolish petroleum excise, the wholesale sales tax and the training guarantee levy. We also propose to stop any superannuation guarantee levy at the ruling rate when a Hewson government comes to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's superannuation policy rejects the notion that a government should impose a particular level of contribution on employers, whatever a firm's individual circumstances may be. A proper retirement incomes policy must regard superannuation as a way to prepare for retirement. Most working Australians want their superannuation to achieve the maximum possible growth each year. They want to be able to decide which fund they can contribute to, as has been shown in Queensland where some 90 per cent of retail staff did not choose to join the union-established industry superannuation fund. What a remarkable turnaround for the unions in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's ceiling on lump sum funds and the restriction on the total annual rebate available to any one individual of $1,500 has been criticised by some commentators. It is important to note that spouses will also be eligible for any such rebate. It is also inappropriate for very high income earners to use superannuation as a milch cow and then, in some cases, arrange their affairs to qualify for pension entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's approach will give younger Australians access to a better system than they have at present. Not only will the coalition's refusal to increase employer contributions further enhance job security&mdash;and that is important with up to 45 per cent of young people jobless at present&mdash;but also they will be able to use up to 75 per cent of their accumulated superannuation benefit for a home deposit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's inflexibility and willingness to hit employers hard, even when they lack the capacity to pay, contrasts with the coalition's superannuation policy, which will restore some sanity to this area but, most importantly, will not allow blinkered ideology to preside over a further loss of jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the results of a Morgan gallup poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Australians believe that tackling unemployment is the most pressing task faced by the Federal Government. In fact, 74 per cent of Australians ranked unemployment as one of the three most important political issues in Australia&mdash;and no wonder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, unemployment in Australia has reached its highest level since the Great Depression and close to one million people are now out of work. Clearly, the overriding priority for the present Government must be to generate new job opportunities, particularly by fostering industries, small business and the farming communities. It is almost unbelievable, therefore, that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill should be so totally at odds with this vital objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been calculated that this legislation will result in nothing short of a massive increase in unemployment due to the impact it will have on business costs. Indeed, as many as 100,000 Australians will lose their jobs because of this legislation. I, for one, cannot think of one reason why the Government should be prepared to introduce any policy which will put so many Australians out on the streets, which will create so much misery amongst Australian families, and which will drive another nail in the coffin of the Australian economy. One of the Government's recent Treasurers, who lost his seat when the music stopped playing, summed up the looming difficulties by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are five people in employment now for every person over 65 years of age; in 20 years time there will be only three. Eleven percent of our population is now over 65 and in 20 years time it will be 18 percent.</PARA>
<PARA>In this financial year alone, the provision of pensions will cost Australian taxpayers some $12 billion. Clearly, something must be done immediately if we are to prevent a massive blow-out in the nation's pension welfare budget in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the most appropriate option is to encourage Australians to provide for their own financial needs in retirement. Greater reliance on superannuation, along with other investments designed to give people income during their retirement, will result in less reliance on the pension and, consequently, less strain on the taxation system. Both of the nation's major political parties acknowledge the desperate need to reduce the overall dependence on pension support. However, the ways that we have gone about planning to achieve this vital objective could not be any more different, as this legislation before the House demonstrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation builds on the Government's policy of providing superannuation entitlements for some employees by forcing the employers to pay the premiums for them. It sets the scene for a new form of payroll tax&mdash;to be called the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;which would come into force on 1 July this year and would compel all employers to make compulsory superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees or be subject to a tough new tax. The cost to business of this new super tax would depend on its total payroll. Whereas small businesses with payrolls of $500,000 would pay 3 per cent, bigger businesses would be forced to pay 5 per cent of the value of their annual payroll or meet the new tax requirements. Over the next eight years, these rates will be steadily increased to 9 per cent of payroll, regardless of how big the business might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way, the Government argues, Australians will become increasingly less dependent on age pensions in their retirement years. The current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), like his predecessor, argues that the new super tax will increase the level of national savings, thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development. In other words, the Government is saying, `Trust us, this new tax will help reduce the nation's foreign debt'. How can anyone take this seriously&mdash;especially when we consider that the present Government has presided over the worst blow-out in foreign debt in Australia's history? In June 1982, gross foreign debt stood at $24 billion. In June last year the figure was $173 billion. That is an increase of just on 140 per cent over the period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put his so-called One Nation statement on Bankcard. He committed the Government to spend an extra $2.3 billion which the Government simply does not have and, as a result, must borrow to fund. When the Treasurer says that his legislation will help reduce foreign debt, forgive me for being a little sceptical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, as this objective is supposed to be so important to the Government, it seems strange that the Treasurer's second reading speech contained only a brief mention of it. There was absolutely no detailed explanation of the extent to which this new super tax would increase the nation's savings. The reason for this is now well known, thanks to the probing of my colleagues in the Senate, which revealed that there is very little evidence that the new super tax would result in significant increases in national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under questioning by my colleague the shadow Minister for social security, child-care and retirement incomes, the Deputy Secretary to the Government's Treasury Department, Dr Alan Preston, admitted that there is no hard-core evidence supporting the contention that the Government's new compulsory superannuation policy would boost national savings significantly over time. This contradicts the line persistently pushed by the Government in support of its draconian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two Treasurers ago, we were told by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) that the super tax:</PARA>

<PARA>Now we have the latest Treasurer repeating the same claim, despite a total lack of evidence to back it up. This says a lot about the lack of integrity of this Government. Only now that the Government has been caught out in this way has it decided to establish an economic modelling group to examine superannuation issues. This is nothing short of a blatant admission by the Government that the legislation before the House has no factual basis whatsoever and that respective Ministers have tried to con the Australian public by saying that its new super tax would achieve results&mdash;for which, as they knew, there was no factual support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Government's other major justification for this far-reaching legislation&mdash;that it will reduce the cost of age pensions? Again, Treasury's answers to questions in the Senate reveal that there is no objective basis for this claim either. When asked what calculations or predictions had been done to determine this legislation's effect on the number of people on the pension in 20 or 30 years time, or the financial savings to the Government owing to this legislation, Treasury's deputy head said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not have any demographic modelling available to us that would allow us to provide such answers. We certainly are unable to provide precise or approximate evidence on what the effect might be 20, 30 or 40 years down the track.</PARA>
<PARA>This means that neither of the Government's two main arguments in support of this legislation stacks up. And yet, despite a total lack of evidence about the long term impact of the new super tax, the Government is prepared to push ahead with its plans. Despite widespread opposition to the legislation around the nation, the Government says its new super tax is essential in order to achieve ongoing benefits, without being able to prove that those long term objectives will ever be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we have determined that the legislation will not necessarily achieve the aims set out by the Government, what impact will it have? The most obvious concern is that the new super tax would be a very significant additional cost to small and big business alike. As it is based entirely on the business payroll, the new super tax would be nothing short of a Federal payroll tax. More importantly, once it is completely phased in, the superannuation levy will be almost double the average prevailing rate of State payroll tax. Importantly, there will be no exemptions to this new tax for small business. If a small business does not take out the required amount of superannuation for each employee, the business must remit a levy to the Taxation Office in its place. This levy will not be tax deductible. It is no wonder the coalition, the Taxation Institute of Australia and every major business group around Australia has slammed the Government's new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its latest survey of business labour costs, confirmed that payroll tax was the biggest labour oncost by far in every State, with the Victorian and Western Australian State governments heading up the list of big taxes. Around Australia, 9.8 per cent of business labour costs were due to payroll tax, compared with 10.7 per cent in Victoria and 10 per cent in Western Australia, both of which are renowned for their addiction to high taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people seem to think that the small business sector is exempt from payroll tax, but this simply is not true. The ABS survey found that small businesses as a whole, being those with less than 20 employees, paid 7.2 per cent of total labour costs as payroll tax, which is not far behind the average of 9.8 per cent for all businesses. Clearly, the States payroll taxes are a major burden on small business, which is why the coalition is committed to scrapping payroll tax altogether. Despite the existing cost burden of the existing State payroll tax system, the Federal Government wants to impose its own kind of payroll tax at a much higher rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS survey found that, on average, businesses paid over $900 in payroll tax for every employee, which is equivalent to just over 3.2 per cent of their wages bill. Imagine the impact this new legislation would have by forcing businesses to pay nearly three times that amount to the Federal Government in the form of its new superannuation levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On average, businesses already pay the equivalent of 3.4 per cent of their total labour costs to superannuation. The impact of eventually being forced to pay a further 9 per cent of their payroll is obvious. Incidentally, these figures are important for another reason: they demonstrate that the business sector already pays, on average, the equivalent of 3.7 per cent of total earnings in the form of superannuation. This is well in excess of the 3 per cent compulsory contribution imposed in 1986 and demonstrates that, whilst some businesses cannot afford and are not required to pay superannuation on behalf of their employees, the business community as a whole is pulling its weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my discussions with business leaders and individual proprietors, I have found that there is a widespread recognition of the need to encourage people to take out private superannuation and to provide for their own retirement. We cannot squeeze blood out of a stone. The business community, especially small business, simply cannot afford to pay the cost involved in achieving this aim, nor should it. This extra cost burden will send many businesses to the wall and will force others to lay off staff to reduce their exposure to Labor's new super tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is common knowledge that the managing director of one of Australia's major department store chains, currently employing around 10,000 Australians, has warned that the proposed increase from 3 per cent of its payroll to 5 per cent would result in a 2 per cent reduction in employee numbers and a further 200 people out of work. There are 850,000 businesses across the nation and it is easy to see how Dr Murphy's economic model demonstrates an increase in unemployment of up to 100,000 people. Businesses, especially small businesses, cannot absorb the extra cost of this new levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession engineered by the present Prime Minister has tightened consumer demand and forced small businesses to become leaner and leaner. Today, those businesses which have survived years of high interest rates, punitive taxes and low levels of consumer demand are not carrying any fat whatsoever. In fact, there could never have been a worse time to impose any additional costs on small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more curious is that the Treasurer has said that this legislation provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this statement, made barely one month ago, the Government is pushing ahead with its plans at a time when the Australian economy has hardly had the capacity to pay a one-way bus fare out of Victoria, and despite the fact that small businesses are still shell-shocked as a result of the worst recession in 60 years. Clearly, the Government accepts that its new superannuation levy will be a major cost burden for small business, particularly as it changed its mind earlier this year and allowed an extra year for businesses with payrolls under $500,000 before their levy obligation is increased from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Across Australia there is widespread recognition of the importance of helping to make small businesses more competitive, and in particular of reducing business costs. Unfortunately, instead of working towards removing taxes on business, such as payroll tax, the Government is going to add to them quite considerably. Compare this with the coalition's plans to scrap seven business taxes and to cut business costs by $20 billion across the nation. Instead of introducing a new tax based on employers wage bills, we are committed to scrapping payroll tax so that the costs are reduced for those businesses which currently pay this tax, as well as for businesses that do not pay the tax directly but which buy goods from businesses which do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the Government's new super tax will cost business a massive $122 billion over the next nine years, as the top rate of tax is phased in. Small business will pay $21.9 billion of this, much of it from businesses which currently do not have to pay payroll tax or a superannuation levy. In addition to the cost of this new scheme, small business will become bogged down with paperwork as it tries to keep pace with the complicated new requirements it imposes. The Taxation Institute of Australia said that the Government's scheme would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . result in unwelcome paperwork particularly for small businesses . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Taxpayers Institute has slammed the way the new levy must be met on a monthly basis from 1993-94 onwards. The employer will be able to pay his or her year's super levy in one go without incurring huge penalties. This means that employers will have to make all their wages and superannuation calculations every month to ensure they know the minimum required level of superannuation support for each employee, as well as the level of actual employer support for the month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minimum level is not met in any one month, the employer will have to pay an interest component as well as an administration fee of $50 flat, plus $30 for each employee concerned. This is exactly the sort of bureaucratic nonsense that Australian small business owners do not want or need and they should not have to put up with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about their employees? Will they benefit a great deal from this legislation? Clearly, they will not. In some cases employees will actually lose out.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the 100,000 or so who stand to lose their jobs will not welcome the Government's plans. But there is reason to suspect that employees as a whole have every reason to suspect the Government of foul play. On 21 August last year, the then Treasurer, responding to a question in this Parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one point which everyone seems to be missing&mdash;we do not necessarily have to assume that superannuation is going to be an add-on to wages.</PARA>
<PARA>During questioning at a Senate committee hearing, the deputy head of Treasury let the cat out of the bag when he said that the only way in which employers could avoid paying the full cost of these measures was for employees to go without wage rises. Asked whether the superannuation levy would be at the expense of wage increases, Dr Preston confirmed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wage increases will be lower than they would otherwise have been.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government has not done its homework on this particular aspect of the issue and cannot tell us the extent of wage increases that will need to be forgone to fund the new super tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that this legislation is supposed to provide a long term benefit for employees, yet it will put many out of work. Those lucky enough to hold onto their jobs stand to suffer further reductions in real wages that will be put aside because of this Government's new super tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, certain groups of employees would be affected more than others under this legislation, particularly part time employees and women. For example, someone employed on a part time or casual basis by a small business and earning $250 a month will have $90 a year set aside as a superannuation contribution under this legislation. However, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has confirmed that the annual cost of administering an individual superannuation entitlement is over $127. This demonstrates that the employee in question would be left with no accrued superannuation benefit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coles-Myer, the nation's largest private employer with 135,000 employees, has also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and the funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of a retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, as this legislation does not apply to employees under 18 years of age, I suspect that some employers will be forced to consider laying off staff when they turn 18, because this legislation makes their employment far more costly than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this legislation does not guarantee any significant benefits in terms of increased national savings or reduced pension payments. Worse still, the Government's new super tax will have a severe impact on the business sector, especially small business, which would have to pay the extra cost of this levy and comply with new paperwork requirements. Even the very employees who are supposed to benefit from superannuation stand to be the big losers, as many will lose their jobs if this new super tax is introduced, while those still in the work force will have to forgo pay rises in coming years. For those reasons, the coalition strongly opposes this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to follow my colleague the shadow Minister for small business, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) because obviously his phone has been running as hot as mine. It feels as though every businessman in my electorate is ringing me at this time. My staff have been inundated with complaints as people register their protest at what the Government is trying to achieve with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very interesting that only three members of the Government are prepared to speak on the legislation in defence of the actions being taken by the Government. Obviously their phones have been ringing hot too. They have been receiving the same sort of input that I have been receiving from my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the important thing that should be noted is the level of contributions to be imposed&mdash;it starts off at a minimum of 3 per cent in 1992-93 and moves right up to 9 per cent in the year 2000. In fact, this may be changed in future amendments to the legislation. But I think what we are looking at is a proposal by the Government which is only going to add to the unemployment problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Confederation of Australian Industry has come out in very strong opposition to what the Government is proposing. It is strongly opposed to the levy, and its main arguments are based on the effect it will have on investment and unemployment. It stresses the unemployment aspect. The CAI argues that enterprises currently not providing superannuation will be required to meet the cost of contributions or the levy from their retained earnings. The reduction in retained earnings will reduce the amount available for enterprises&mdash;and that is all businesses&mdash;particularly small and medium sized enterprises. I guess in the electorate of Bendigo most of the businesses would fall into that category. Most of them are small, family owned businesses; there are some medium sized enterprises; and there is only a handful of large ones. But all of them have been in contact with me expressing their concern about the imposition of a further cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAI argues also that the amount available for enterprises, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, to reinvest in the enterprise will be limited, and this will result in lower investment back into the business. The alternative will be for these firms to borrow the funds at a high cost for investment, but the funds likely to be available for small to medium firms may not increase to offset the reduction in retained earnings. This is due to the practice of superannuation investments being channelled into the larger, blue-chip firms. As the proportion of available capital invested in these bodies increases, there is a reduction in the proportion of capital available to small or medium firms. That would be disastrous for many firms, particularly in Victoria where the state of the economy is the worst it has been for 60 years or more and the level of economic activity at this time is extremely low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, according to the CAI, the small to medium firm will face the increased costs associated with that borrowing. However, these effects may be offset by the fact that not all retained profits are reinvested, so that funds need not be channelled from investment but may come from other uses of retained earnings and the additional cost of borrowing may not be sufficient to effect many rational investment decisions, which are based on many criteria. I do not quite agree exactly with the Confederation of Australian Industry on that point, but I am sure that its next point will hit home with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Confederation of Australian Industry makes the point that the superannuation guarantee levy will impose an additional cost on employers that, in the current recessed climate, will force them to reduce costs by shedding labour. That is what I am being told right now in the city of Bendigo. In the Bendigo electorate, the unemployment rate is high. It is running at 25.9 per cent in the shire of Bet Bet and 16 per cent in Bendigo and Maryborough. Youth unemployment is running at a rate of 46 per cent. Almost 7,000 people are out of work in the Bendigo area at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government through this levy is forcing additional costs onto employers, whose only alternative will be to reduce costs by shedding more labour. The additional cost will be sufficient to drive some small to medium enterprises into liquidation. I would have thought that the Government would have realised the damage that it has done, particularly to the Victorian economy, in view of the number of small businesses which have gone into liquidation and receivership over the past two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAI argues also that the superannuation guarantee levy will result in increased unemployment. It has estimated that the effect of the superannuation guarantee levy, the SGL, will be to put at risk between 45,000 and 60,000 jobs. I know for a fact that it will have a dramatic impact on my electorate. The figures I have quoted show that every business there is looking very hard at its work force because of the depressed economic conditions. It is not a matter of putting people on;  they are asking, `How can we reduce staff and maintain a business and keep it viable to get us through the recession?'. It should also be noted that superannuation contributions made by an employer are tax deductible, while the superannuation guarantee levy will not be deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned unemployment and the impact that the levy will have on businesses in my electorate. The criticism that I have of this legislation is that the Government is imposing this levy on businesses without any regard for their ability to pay. In fact, the Government is saying, `You will pay this levy whether your business is operating profitably and irrespective of the level of profitability that your business is running at'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism of the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;it also applied to the training guarantee levy&mdash;is that it resembles a payroll tax. It is a disincentive to take on additional employees. In fact, it is an incentive to reduce the number of employees. The levy is imposed regardless of profitability, as is payroll tax. The enterprises, as I have said, are just hanging on now. They are finding it extremely difficult, not only because of the recession, but also because of the difficult times the rural sector has had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bendigo is a shopping centre for many people from the rural areas far to the north, east and west and has a shopping population of about 150,000. All the businesses in the retail sector, the commercial area, of Bendigo are feeling the impact. This proposal by the Government to add further costs will be very detrimental to the economic operation of those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that the Government really has overlooked relates to national savings. It has provided no incentive at all for employee contributions. There is no requirement for an employee contribution. I would have thought that any superannuation scheme would have had a higher value and would have been much more attractive had a contribution been made by the employee as well as by the employer. It has been argued that this would, in fact, reduce the value of the contribution made by the employer, as perceived by the employee, while reducing the end benefit available and increasing the employer's costs, compared with a situation where both the employer and the employee are required to contribute to their superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-employed people are some of the losers under this legislation. I want to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is sitting at the table. It is a very difficult time for self-employed business people to operate their businesses. They work long hours. Of course, they choose to do that; but in the past three years, particularly in the Bendigo area, those self-employed business people have been working extremely long hours for little or no profit. The fact that the superannuation guarantee levy legislation does not require any level of contribution for self-employed persons may be a blessing. But what does it do with the Government's proposal to try to increase national savings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really misses the mark on that aspect. There are a tremendous number of self-employed people who run small businesses in country areas. I am sure that the Minister would recognise that. What opportunity do they have?  They have to take out a private superannuation scheme, which we encourage. It is part of our policy to encourage people to take out those private superannuation funds so that they can make provision for their future. My comment to the Minister is this: if it is so important to force retirement income down the throats of the work force, there is no good reason why the self-employed should be excluded under this legislation. I fail to see what the Government really has in view there. If the whole idea is to have retirement income provisions, why is the Government leaving out self-employed people in this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to some further comments about Treasury and what it had to say particularly about the impact of the Government's efforts to encourage savings. The Treasury is particularly conscious of this. The most that it claims in favour of the superannuation guarantee levy is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non superannuation savings . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They might be in real estate, or property, or land, or whatever the case may be. Treasury further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings. . . Some substitution . . . can be expected, however . . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available.</PARA>
<PARA>As Paddy McGuinness has argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weight of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of things that make people in the community concerned about what the Government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access Economics also had some very interesting things to say about this legislation, particularly on the matters of inflation and unemployment. It has predicted that the Government's proposals will, if passed, lead to a 5 per cent increase in inflation and the loss of at least 60,000 jobs through the 1990s. So it concurs with the Confederation of Australian Industry. The only way such a scheme could possibly succeed, without putting thousands out of work and refuelling inflation, would be for the increases to be at the expense of wage rises&mdash;in other words, to require Australian workers to forgo significant wage increases over the next decade in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension. The more likely outcome is that the cost of superannuation will be met from funds which would otherwise have been used by businesses to reinvest, generate new jobs and expand activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real losers in this legislation, too. It is a very bad deal for part time workers. Part time and casual employees really miss out in this legislation and do worst out of the compulsory superannuation. More than two million of those employees are women. Not only will they be effectively forced to forgo very substantial wage rises, but as well the amount set aside for them in the name of superannuation will be decimated by administration, insurance and taxation charges, leaving them with a small cash pittance and no retirement income, or very little, at the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing here is the deduction of money from people's earnings as a compulsory superannuation levy. It will be paid into that fund, and it will sit there and attract all those administrative and other costs. At the end of it, there will be very little value for part time and casual employees in their contribution to the superannuation guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAI really summed up the situation in a submission that it made to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The very last thing the Australian economy needs at this time are further increases in business costs. . . which will make the recession deeper and more intractable. . . add to unemployment and put upwards pressure on inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>It has summed it up very neatly. I think the Minister for Finance, who is to respond for the Government in this debate, has to reflect on the cost in terms of unemployment and of further closures of small and medium sized businesses adding to the already one million people who are out of work in Australia, and the impact that it will have on part time employees as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have probably almost another million people in Australia who are only working a few hours a week or maybe a couple of days a week. They are underemployed. We have almost another million people who want to do more work in the Australian economic community but are not able to get into it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at why the Parliament is debating this particular Government proposal this evening. We are aware that we already have `award superannuation', once called `vocational superannuation'. It is made up of funds managed by trade unions. We are aware that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said that, wherever possible, the Government will facilitate the continuation of these additional compulsorily contributed funds by employers going to those same union funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of fact that, as Treasurer, the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited a conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in Sydney some years ago at which he informed it that its industrial muscle was in decline. Might I add that by his actions he has been the principal contributor to that, notwithstanding that neither he nor his union mates at the ACTU are yet aware of it. By deregulating so many aspects of the Australian economy, he has forced upon Australia the deregulation of the labour market. Government members will bury their heads in the sand on that issue, but it would occur even if they were to remain in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, tell the ACTU conference? He said, `You are losing your industrial muscle. I have given you the opportunity to take on financial muscle. You will get that through your superannuation funds. It is time you entered self-management; that you even abandoned the good advice that might be available from some fund managers, and managed the money yourself'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wonder why that happened. Of course, we recollect the visit of the ACTU to Sweden when it was going to discover how to run Australia in the future. The ACTU came back and prepared a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. I refer the House to page 21 of that document, where the ACTU made some passing remarks about superannuation. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment through superannuation funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio to longer term growth and expansion objectives. This can be achieved by diverting some proportion of the future income of such funds into a National Development Fund managed through the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).</PARA>
<PARA>For quite some time the ACTU has had its eye on some substantial amounts of money coming from superannuation, and it has this wonderful plan as to how government might manage that in the national interest. We have had a rash of examples in the last decade of how government has managed the people's money. It is probably not more obvious than in my State&mdash;although, in terms of money lost, Victoria leads by a country mile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that had the ACTU been able to achieve this at about the date of its publication, it might have been contemplating putting Brian Burke in charge of these funds, just as this Government was contemplating making him our next Prime Minister. People are sitting there waiting to retire on these princely sums that are going to come forward, on the misrepresentation that they will be substantial, and one wonders whether they would be happy about having such captains of industry and such men of economic and funds management expertise looking after their money. Might I add that if it were Mr Kelty or some of his union colleagues, I would be equally afeard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation we are in. That is the background to this legislation tonight. It has nothing to do with achieving satisfactory retirement incomes for Australians. It has very little to do with protecting the tax base.

But do not think that is new: one only needs to read the novel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hotel</EMPHASIS> to find out how at one stage the proprietor of a hotel which was not unionised was forced to go to the union pension fund to raise funds to ward off the entrepreneur who was trying to take his hotel over. The condition was quite simple: he would unionise his entire work force. In other words, business will have to pay money which will come under the control of the trade union movement, and at the end of a period of time those same business people will have to go back to that trade union to borrow the money they have contributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), pointed out, history does not support these large funds investing in small business. If I have time before my speech is concluded, I will bring some evidence to the Parliament on that matter. What I want to talk about is the fraud, the deception and the dishonesty that is being practised upon the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, by the Prime Minister's own admission today, the work force is to forgo a 10 per cent wage increase. He did not say he would convince the people who have to take a pay packet home to a wife and tell her how to feed three or four kids, pay the rent, mortgage or whatever; he said, `We have convinced their leaders'. A large percentage of those workers do not agree with their leaders, do not want the people they have as leaders and do not want to be forced into being members of their trade union organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past day I have had three separate phone calls from people in Western Australia telling me that they are unable to get work driving their own trucks without joining the Transport Workers Union. I got off the phone to the last one just half an hour ago. It is a disgraceful situation when people are denied the right to employment if they do not join a trade union, ostensibly to protect workers, when these people are self-employed. These people do not want to join; they do not want to be in the organisation, but they have agreed with the Government that they will forgo 10 per cent of their wages to get this investment miracle of superannuation with the wonderful lump sums, et cetera, that will be forthcoming in the years hence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation and similar forms of insurance and assurance policies have been available throughout my living memory. I know numerous people a little older than me, retiring at this point, who are the subject of either employer-type&mdash;and, might I add, generous employer-type&mdash;retirement policies or personally purchased superannuation or other life assurance lump sum policies. Each and every one of them had some decision to make 20 or 30 years ago as to what sort of lump sum or pension they might like, as in most cases they personally contributed part or all of it. They made decisions in dollar values. To quote one person, `When we concluded our arrangements in my employment package, the superannuation pay-out I was to receive when I left work at 65 was going to allow me to buy a block of flats, live in one and let the rest for an adequate retirement income. But when I got the money 30 years later it would not buy one flat'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we offering people today?  When the poor old employer levy gets to 12 per cent, what will it deliver?  Luckily, it might deliver an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids, but it will not deliver a retirement income at the inflated costs of those days. Superannuation never has, if it is an ordinarily funded arrangement. I concede that some of the more generous government ones do because they are not funded, but they just become a burden on the taxpayer of the day and are linked to the salaries of the retiree's replacement, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one puts money into a fund and that money accumulates the pay-out is peanuts, because one is not protected from inflation. Not long ago we were reading about the remarkable performances of fund managers, earning 20 to 30 per cent. Might I add, that was not 20 or 30 per cent on an employee's or the manager's contributions; that percentage was always declared on what was left after the Government had taken out its 15 per cent, after the union had taken out its dollar a week and after the fund managers had taken out their particular percentage. The return was calculated on what was left which, as we have discovered, was not much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already brought evidence to this Parliament of part time and casual workers&mdash;good supporters of the Labor Party&mdash;shearers and shed hands, who have discovered after a couple of years of involvement in this wonderful vocational award superannuation that the net value of their policies is about 50 per cent of employer contributions; it is worth only half of what the boss put in. How can one possibly support that sort of arrangement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 29 April&mdash;just a few days ago&mdash;that CML has been obliged to dramatically cut its bonuses to cover its Australian business, which is generating a return on capital of less than one per cent. We did achieve zero per cent inflation for one quarter, but we are not claiming that for the year. But at the moment that fund is not even achieving inflation, and neither are many of the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do these funds deliver above average performances in better times?  I have been in business all my life, and by personal hard work and many long hours I have generally made profits. I was never able to imagine how some entrepreneurs could get so rich so quickly because we always have another partner in every business, called the tax man. It is my experience that if I had a particularly good year he very smartly evened it out for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that in business one cannot deliver profits of 20 or 30 per cent at any point in time. But the funds were doing it. How did they achieve that? They already have huge amounts of money and the purpose of this legislation is to funnel another gigantic amount of funds&mdash;$3 billion or $4 billion a year&mdash;into their coffers. What has been the practice of the funds with this money? Their practice has been to ramp the share market and the property market. Unfortunately, that is an unnatural process. Eventually it comes to a cyclical peak and the whole thing collapses in a heap, creating great problems of economic management and resulting in the recognition that in the end there is a real value for everything. How do these funds make their profits by that ramping?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members one simple example of one of the major funds to whom this Government is going to deliver all these additional moneys. Let us take, for example, a fund with a holding of $100m or $200m worth of BHP shares which are trading at, say, $10&mdash;I do not know their current value. The fund manager has a look at the old balance sheet and realises that it is not getting on as well as it should, so he goes out and buys another couple of million dollars worth of BHP shares at, say, $11. He will be a bit more cunning than that and will probably push the shares up 20c a day for one or two weeks, at the end of which he will have got them up by about $2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then revalues $200m or maybe $500m of the shares he is holding and declares that a profit. It has done nothing for the nation; it has not built one extra factory. In fact, it has not laid one extra brick. Of course, the fund was doing the same thing in the property market: if it owned 10 top skyscrapers it would buy another one for 20 per cent more than it was worth and revalue the other ones by 20 per cent. I wonder whether the wizard across the road with, I think, some academic degrees has ever thought how that works. One can ask oneself how else it would work. There is only one means by which businesses increase in value, and that is by producing more profits. Those opposite can look back and see that throughout the boom, other than with this ramping process, very few of them did: it was not by productivity. We find within the Australian economy a very interesting graph situation when we put productivity growth and GDP growth on the same page, with GDP growth flashing away in an upward direction from productivity growth because in the 1980s and the early 1990s this country has run on debt, not on productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite think they are going to force people to save money by putting it into these funds, with the ambition of the ACTU to have most of it reinvested in Australia, they should look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 4 August 1989, which lists the 10 top fund managers. It tells us where they invested their money. Bankers Trust had more than 40 per cent&mdash;nearly half&mdash;of its investments in Australian equities. National Mutual had all its funds in BHP, WMC, NAB, Elders, CRA and BTR. AMP Balanced had its money in the top 10 banks, Coles-Myer, CSR, Amcor, MIM, CRA, North Broken Hill and Caltex. I ask the Minister whether he has heard even one middle sized business mentioned yet. How much more money does he want to be put into these people? How much higher does he want the value of their shares to go while they produce not one whit more? That is where the Government's national savings are going to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, things have been so bad economically in Australia that the opportunity&mdash;which this Bill will not assist&mdash;to make profits with the present wage structures, et cetera, is such that the AMP, the largest of these funds, has now gone offshore and has started to buy itself insurance companies in England. It will get a return for the shareholders, for the contributors, but it will not reinvest in Australia unless the returns are adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primarily, the purpose of such funds, because of their huge holdings, is to participate in the share market in a way that delivers nothing. We do not see them coming in when someone else has a new float, unless it is the floating of the Commonwealth Bank</PARA>
<PARA>or something. When somebody comes up with a bit of a risky investment we will not find these funds being ripped off employers in the so-called interest of the employee; we will not find any of that being invested in greenfield propositions. These big funds will sit back and wait; they are almost obliged to do so.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why would the Government be forcing people to put part of their earnings there?  The Prime Minister has said it is coming; it has being paid by the employer but there is 10 per cent that employees will not get&mdash;the Government's own constituency. What are people going to get for it? They will get an investment in the AMP, an investment in the ramping of the share market and the property market, but no investment in the growth of Australia. It is just forcing up the value of existing companies. If the Minister thinks that is smart, he is stupid. That is where I started my speech and that is where I will finish it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fairly unusual for the Opposition to take the opportunity to speak on the third reading of a Bill. But I have to do so, and I am delighted to see that at last the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has come into the chamber because we required him to come in for the vote. The fact is that we have had this debate in the chamber for a number of hours and we have not seen the Treasurer in the House to take charge of this, his own, legislation. Furthermore, he did not bother to speak in the debate; nor did he bother to comment on remarks made by me and various other members of the House from both sides. It merely demonstrates yet again what we see in this House time and time again, which is a total unwillingness by members of this Government to face up to their responsibilities as parliamentarians to this House and all members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not good enough for the Treasurer once again to leave the chamber during what is his legislation. How does he expect the people of Australia to regard this legislation? They know that it is of such fundamental importance that it will affect the lifestyles and the saving capacity&mdash;and in fact the very employment&mdash;of hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens who have no control over their destiny, who have no say in what happens to them under this legislation. This is simply a sordid deal between the Government and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all the elements of this debate those words come through: a deal has been struck and it will be consummated in this Parliament. It is my belief and it is certainly the belief of the Opposition that when the legislation gets to the other place the Government will find the going far more difficult because it has failed during the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to demonstrate any case whatsoever which would support the very principles upon which it alleges this legislation should be based. For example, it has failed to demonstrate to the Senate and certainly to the House of Representatives why these proposals will not have a major cost in terms of employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Question Time today we had evidence put forward to demonstrate absolutely that in the words of the Treasury alone in the next five years over 100,000 jobs will simply not exist because of the additional costs brought on employers as a result of this legislation. Clearly, one has to assume that these are mere bagatelles; they are not matters of great significance. Who is going to care? I can tell the Government who is going to care: the Australian people. I can tell the Government who is going to speak for them in this place; it will be members of the Liberal and National parties. It is we and we alone who stand up at this time to demonstrate as well as we can that compulsory superannuation legislation of this nature is fundamentally flawed. It will do nothing to overcome the real problems about which we have heard so much from all members in this debate tonight&mdash;the problems of a greying society and the problem that by the year 2020 we will have a ratio of 3:1 compared with the  current rate of 7:1.  These are  fundamental  issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Treasurer? Why is he not here? Why is he not taking through this legislation? Why has he not spoken in this debate? We are now on the third reading of this legislation. I trust that at this late stage the Minister will take the opportunity to take his place at the dispatch box and explain to the House&mdash;as he endeavoured to do but failed to do after Question Time today&mdash;why the comments made by the Treasury officials at the Senate committee inquiry, in response to the very sensible questions put to them by the shadow Minister for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>social security and by other members of the Senate, were of such a nature that we are now absolutely convinced of the veracity of our cause. We are pleased to see that members of the Australian Democrats are also very concerned about the quality of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not good enough to come up with a deal, put together by the Government and the ACTU, based on a range of propositions which, when they are tested, are found to be fundamentally flawed. These are important decisions. They are matters of great moment. I earnestly hope that we will not see a continuation of the arrogance of the Treasurer as we have in the last few hours, that he will enter this debate and he will answer the fundamental issues which have been put to him by me and by other speakers in this debate this evening. </PARA>

<PARA>Since the introduction of the Bill on 2 April 1992, the Government has received a number of representations concerning various aspects of the Bill.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prepayment of contributions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first significant change will be to allow prepayments of superannuation contributions to be taken into account in determining, in certain cases, whether superannuation guarantee charge requirements have been met. Under the existing Bill, for the 1993-94 and subsequent years of income, contributions made within 28 days after the end of a contribution period&mdash;that is, any of the 12 months of the year&mdash;may be taken into account for that contribution period. However, contributions made prior to a contribution period cannot be taken into account in that period. The amendment will enable contributions paid prior to a particular contribution period to be taken into account for that period, provided the contribution is made within 12 months of the beginning of the period. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign executives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important change is to introduce a further category of employee who is excluded from the superannuation guarantee arrangements. The category is to be set out in regulations and is to include those employees who are overseas executives of international corporations who come to Australia on a temporary basis to establish a branch of the company or to join an existing branch in a managerial or executive capacity. The effect of the amendment will be that superannuation contributions do not need to be made by an employer on behalf of these overseas executives. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemption for certain payments made by the Commissioner of Taxation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also propose to provide an income tax exemption for certain payments made by the Commissioner of Taxation in the event of an employee's death or early retirement due to illness. The proposed amendment will provide that where the Commissioner pays the `shortfall component' of the superannuation guarantee charge to an employee under 55 years of age who has retired from the work force due to illness, or to the legal personal representative of an employee who has died, the payment is exempt from income tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this has been a cognate debate, I would like to make a few observations about various aspects of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992. Firstly, I was intrigued to notice that the SGL legislation does not require any levels of contribution for self-employed persons. This is a matter, among others, which I would have hoped the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would have been able to explain to us: how it is possible to argue a case for a so-called universal scheme, but at the same time ignore the realities that many hundreds of thousands of people are self-employed and are as entitled as anybody else, therefore, to access the welfare and the pension system upon retirement. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to presume that the system should also encourage them to be in it, whether it be through the 23FC funds or, perhaps, to join the schemes which may already be on the marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, as I have regrettably made my remarks in the third reading debate, the opportunity to seek this information is apparently not open to us. No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) will do his best to answer what we all know is an extremely complex matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I would like to refer to is the question of part time and casual employees. As I said in the second reading debate, the evidence is fairly clear: there will be those who will do worst out of a so-called compulsory superannuation system; in fact, some two million people fit that category, and most of them are women. Most of them, even under this legislation, are going to be in a situation where they may well be excluded because of the very low levels of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that the Government, presumably, has put up is that their exclusion is due to the fact that the administrative costs of handling such small amounts do not make their inclusion worthwhile. On that point, therefore, I have to draw attention to the Opposition's policy in relation to the provision of what we call retirement savings accounts. We like to think that the retirement savings account is one of the great initiatives of the last few years in terms of the Opposition's contribution to the debate on retirement income. They would work basically the same as bank accounts and be as simple as bank accounts. They would have an advantage in that a part time worker coming in and out of the work force would be able to make contributions when he is so able. The funds would remain there and they would go up with the normal effluxion of time and the accumulation of interest. The administrative charges would be extremely low, if at all; in fact, they would probably compare with the same charge rates currently applying to savings accounts with banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued, therefore, to notice a reference in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of a few days ago that the Government is considering the introduction of what it calls superannuation savings accounts. All one can say is `a rose by any other name'. But one would hope, of course, that, should the Government go down this way, it will at least note that the idea did come from us. I think it would be a major contribution&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it still came from us; it does not matter how long it has been in the air. As a matter of fact, I first announced it in 1986, so it has been around for some time. Nevertheless, it is an initiative that would be of some definite value in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to overall employees, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the problem of the effect of this legislation. For example, Coles Myer, is the country's largest private employer with 135,000 employees and will certainly be required to fit the payroll category of $500,000 or more. Therefore by the year 2000 and subsequent years it would be in a position where it would be expected to fund at least 9 per cent. It is interesting to note that, of that significant number of employees, 32 per cent are regular casuals under the age of 21. Coles Myer had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that fact is based on its assessment, which is correct, that the administrative costs of funding such a scheme would, in most cases, be well over 1 1/2 per cent of notional contributions. Consequently, whether one is referring to people in that category or, as I said, in relation to women&mdash;and we are talking about no less than two million non-working women in the work force&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the fundamental weaknesses of this legislation&mdash;and they are many, a myriad&mdash;is the reality that the Government has ignored the presence in the Australian community of over two million non-working women who have been denied access to the alleged benefits despite the fact that women not only live longer than men, but they are also particularly financially vulnerable in their retirement years in the event of early widowhood or divorce. That is, incidentally, an observation made by no less than the ACTU itself. Therefore, I am surprised, if not shocked, to see, since the ACTU has regarded itself, rightly or wrongly, as being the dynamo, the driving force, behind all of these legislative changes, that it has totally ignored the realities of the need for retirement income for over two million Australian women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Opposition has faced up to this problem. We have made a fundamental change in the whole structure of superannuation funding with the effect that we would permit people to have a tax deductibility of 25 per cent up to annual contributions of $6,000 a year. I might add that under this legislation the Government is offering only $4,000 a year. So there is a significantly greater advantage in our proposals than in the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, side by side with that, we are effectively saying to a married couple that, if they wish to finance the superannuation and retirement income of their spouse, that woman, or man as the case may be, would also be entitled to be funded up to $6,000 a year. So effectively the combined family contribution rate would be $12,000, to all of which the 25 per cent tax rebate would apply. That is an extremely generous package and it is far beyond the very narrow boundaries of this ridiculous piece of legislation that we are debating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not hold the House up any longer on this particular Bill save to say that the response which employers have made to clauses in this legislation&mdash;particularly in relation to their concern about whether they are in the half a million dollar or less category, where their funding rate will be 3 per cent in 1982-83 going up to 9 per cent in subsequent years after the year 2000, or in the payroll category of half a million or more where the rate would start off at 5 per cent and go up to 9 per cent in the year 2000 and beyond&mdash;has been unanimous. It is simply that this legislation will cost jobs at the very time when Australia, like most other developed countries, regrettably, appears to be going into a phase of our economic development where periods of unemployment in excess of 12 months may well be the norm. This, unfortunately, is a statistical fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one analyses the last 20 years, one will see that at one stage unemployment over three months was regarded as long term. Then it went to six months; then it went to nine months; and now it is out to 12 months. One can look at the reality of how long it took to work through the unemployed from the period of the 1983 recession; the answer is that it took nearly seven years. I wonder how many years it is going to take the million-odd people who have lost their jobs in the last 12 months or so in Australia to find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many of them are going to be told that one reason why they cannot find jobs is that they are too expensive to employ. Why are they too expensive to employ? It is because of the myriad of taxes and charges which are levied on big and small business alike. It is at this time that those charges should be removed. The Fightback package is directly aimed at doing precisely that, that is, removing seven fundamental taxes from the Australian taxation system and, above all, removing taxes on wages and taxes on employment. The sad fact about this legislation is that it is, indeed, an additional tax on employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take too much time either because I know that the hour is late. I want to support the amendments that are before the Chair at the moment, which the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) obviously did not address. I thought that was why he rose to speak. He amazes me when he talks about what the Opposition has done in relation to women in the work force and, particularly, women in relation to superannuation. I spoke on the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Bill earlier tonight, but I will repeat it so that he will hear it because obviously he did not get it right. When the Opposition was last in office in 1983, the overall proportion of workers with any type of superannuation entitlements was only 39 per cent, with the rate being 50 per cent for male workers and a miserable 24 per cent for female employees. I remind the honourable member for Bradfield that today these figures have risen to 72 per cent for the work force as a whole with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 78.5 per cent of female workers. That is an increase from 24 per cent to 78.5 per cent of female workers, and that is a pretty fair effort in itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation before us tonight will further improve that because so many women, particularly, will benefit from the employer superannuation fund. The honourable member for Bradfield also needs to realise that in providing the superannuation obviously there will be a need to negotiate, through the industrial arena, ways of implementing the increase in the superannuation fund. Employers have failed, of course. They had been given the opportunity, under the superannuation provisions, under the award provisions, to respond in a positive way. This legislation is now necessary because they have failed to respond, and it is necessary now to force employers who have failed to provide sensible superannuation for their employees. So it has got to this stage for that simple reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield talked about self-employed people. Surely, the self-employed people have enough brains to provide for their own retirement through their own superannuation funds. What we are talking about here is providing superannuation for employees. That is the important part. If, of course, the self-employed people do not provide for their own superannuation or their own retirement, something will be need to be done with that, I do not doubt, in the longer term. But this particular legislation relates to employees. I think we need to clearly understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years, before this Government took the action it did in improving superannuation for so many people in the work force, there was the big incentive for self-employed people to go into superannuation funds, mainly as a tax concession. I think we all realise that. One of the fastest growing industries under the previous Liberal Government was the tax avoidance industry. We used to see all this money being channelled into superannuation funds purely for tax benefits. I think most self-employed people are smart enough to realise that, and I think the honourable member for Bradfield is putting them down somewhat by suggesting that they need to be included in this in any way. I wanted to correct a few misunderstandings by the honourable member for Bradfield, and I hope that we will get these amendments through quite comfortably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate two years ago I quoted the following extract from an article in a May 1982 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most neglected date on the Australian calendar is May 8. While it is fitting that our war dead should be honoured on April 25, it is surprising that there is no celebration on a similar scale to mark our national survival. . . Never in Australia's history has the nation stood in such peril.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time I made that speech there was virtually no public awareness that the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea was only two years away. As I stated in my speech, my purpose in raising it then was to urge the Government to give this anniversary the recognition it should receive as a critical event in our national history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members will be aware that over the past few days the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, and Secretary of Education, Mr Alexander, have been in Australia as official guests for the Coral Sea anniversary celebrations and ceremonies. In addition, a number of US Navy ships are paying goodwill visits to various Australian ports. However, I believe that it should be placed on record here that, as well as the substantial contribution made by both the Australian and US governments to our commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea, a significant contribution has been made by ordinary Australians&mdash;a number of whom have for many years put considerable personal effort into maintaining within this country an awareness of the importance to Australia of its American alliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon at the Australian War Memorial, Secretary Alexander unveiled a new display in the `War in the Pacific' section, dedicated to the Battle of the Coral Sea. This display was a community initiative. Various individuals&mdash;both American and Australian&mdash;and organisations contributed approximately $100,000 towards its cost. I hasten to add that the War Memorial itself contributed an amount more than equal to that. Furthermore, notwithstanding the community support&mdash;notably through the Australian-American Association&mdash;that the project attracted, its successful completion owes a great deal to the enthusiastic support of the War Memorial Chairman, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, and the Director, Brendon Kelson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The display is a reproduction of the bridge of the USS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yorktown</EMPHASIS>, one of the two aircraft carriers involved in the battle. Much of the equipment in the display was provided by the US Navy. It graphically portrays, including through the use of military archival film taken at the time, the military tactics of the Japanese fleet&mdash;namely, to secure Port Moresby from the sea, to attack allied bases at Thursday Island, Cooktown and Townsville, and, at the least, to force Australia out of the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now a well-documented part of history that the damage inflicted on the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea was a decisive factor in the United States Navy's victory in the Battle of Midway less than one month later. From that point on, Japan had no chance of winning the war. The battle indeed turned the tide. We owe much to the courage and skills of the American sailors in the Battle of the Coral Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly fitting that we should acknowledge the 543 Americans who lost their lives in that battle. This landmark display at the Australian War Memorial will serve to make future generations of Australians aware of how great was the peril of our country in those days referred to as Australia's darkest, and how important strong alliances are to our national security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last few days the Australian press has carried details of race riots in American cities, principally Los Angeles, following the decision of the jury in what has become known as the Rodney King case. This has led to a wide range of leading articles in Australian newspapers, some adverse journalistic comment about the inadequacy of the American jury system, and questions as to how, within the framework of the American legal process, a jury of laymen could make such a grievous error.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many of the propositions advanced in the editorials are soundly based, I advise our editorial writers, before they get too moralistic and start reflecting on the US judicial system and its impact on race relations, that they would do well to pause and consider why, over some years, many of those writers have not felt the same level of editorial erudition and moralising when it comes to our own judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If laymen on a jury in the United States can in the light of the available evidence get it so wrong, to use the popular term, what do we say of a High Court composed of Australia's most distinguished lawyers when, in the light of all the available evidence to the contrary, they endorsed and accepted the doctrine of terras nullius? Terras nullius was the notion that some 200 years ago this island continent was unoccupied and nobody owned it by right of prior occupation. Because it was an empty place and unoccupied, its annexation was therefore legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was Australia occupied; scientific evidence suggests a continual occupation for some 60,000 years. As Aboriginal legends and religious belief make no reference to migration, there is no scientific evidence to contradict the Aboriginal belief that Australia as they knew it was the ultimate source of their origin. At the time the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese visited our shores, this island continent was divided by boundaries well known and understood by its own group of Aboriginal peoples and by their neighbours, and supported by religious and spiritual beliefs centred upon their occupation of their own land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no legal concept as perverse, myopic and riddled with the mores of the occupying colonial power as terras nullius. We may well ask, in the light of the enormous and ever-expanding body of research, how our distinguished judges got it wrong. Even now, compared with Canada, Mexico, the United States, New Zealand and even South Africa, Australia continues to refuse to legally recognise the prior occupation and possession of this land by its indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as a multicultural society, prides itself on its capacity to absorb people of mixed background, religion and origins. However, Australia in 1992 has yet to come to terms with the rights of its own indigenous people. The maintenance and continuation of the concept of terras nullius within our legal structure shames not only our judicial system but also our nation. It is a concept that should be rejected by this Parliament and by our High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal doctrine should attract at least some of the same attention of our editorial writers as the recent events in Los Angeles. Perhaps it is easier for journalists, as it is for the rest of us, to moralise about the event in the United States and to proffer advice rather than to face the reality of our own history. The sad and tragic fact of the history of the second settlement of Australia is that the genocide of and the denial of fundamental human rights to our indigenous people&mdash;the first Australians&mdash;not only has distorted and falsified our history, but some 200 years later has recorded them as the most deprived of all our citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the process of reconciliation now being undertaken by this Parliament is to become at all relevant to Aboriginal Australia, it should begin by clearly rejecting the concept of terras nullius, and hopefully in so doing it will have the support not only of our editorial writers but also of our judiciary. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has to come a breaking point. Either the Government has to recognize the plight of the intellectually disabled in regard to accommodation or parents end up in hospitals suffering total physical and emotional fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the story of many families in South Australia who have children with intellectual disabilities or head injuries. The present Government has not come to their aid. They are worse off than they were before.
