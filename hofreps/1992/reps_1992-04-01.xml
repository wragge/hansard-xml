<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you have just indicated, the legislation before the House covers five different Bills: the Deer Slaughter Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill 1992, the Deer Export Charge Bill 1992 and the Primary Industries and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1992. This legislation will establish a deer industry research and development fund through industry levies and government contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the House for very long on this issue, because the main debate took place yesterday. I will briefly go over some of the facts. The deer industry is a growing industry in Australia. This legislation has been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia. At the moment, the industry has 155,000 deer, and around 1,000 farms are involved in that production. The industry is growing at the rate of about 25 per cent per year and, until this stage, it had voluntary levies on its members and an income of $25,000 from those levies. These Bills mean that the industry could expect in the vicinity of $100,000 coming in for research, development and promotion. The coalition supports this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few general comments about the need for our industries to be world competitive. Previous speakers in the debate have mentioned the fact that competition is occurring in this area, particularly from New Zealand, which has a much larger deer industry. Australian farmers, people in manufacturing businesses, miners and so on have to realise that we are now in a global market and we have to face up to the fact that there is world competition. Australia will benefit from the fact that it has a country nearby which is competitive and which will make industries in Australia more efficient. I think that is the case with the deer industry market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australians, we have to make sure that our infrastructure, which is often outside the control of farmers or business people, is efficient&mdash;the areas in which government has a say. If the money which is raised in the deer industry is to be beneficial in promoting venison as a product within Australia and overseas, we have to have competitive transport systems and a competitive industrial relations framework in Australia, because it is these types of costs which impact and impose on our industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot ignore the fact that we are in a global market; we are not just in regional markets. Australia is part of the global community. As a Parliament we have to ensure that the infrastructure costs which are imposed by governments on people such as deer farmers, by the framework which we put in place, are the most efficient possible. It is good to see a developing industry. In the State of Tasmania there are presently about 85 deer producers. I am sure that the number will continue to grow. Producers are able to dispose of their product. The deer industry is an important industry in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of parliament we should give every encouragement to new and rising industries in the rural sector of this country. We need to diversify, because as we diversify we are going to find niche markets around the world into which we can provide products. The deer industry is growing in Australia, and it should be encouraged. I am sure that the investment of some of the farmers' moneys into research, development and marketing will bring benefits to this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that some people in Tasmania are not happy with some aspects of the deer industry and the way in which they feel some of this money may be used. I think it would be good if the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia came under the umbrella of the National Farmers Federation. That is the peak body in which the Tasmanian farmers would like to see their industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this type of industry develops there needs  to be recognition that there may be regional differences in the way in which farmers would like their product marketed. I recognise that from a national point of view we would hope that industries would act in unison. Within those industries there is a need for an awareness that different products and different regions may need to market differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would encourage the deer industry to look at those differences within its own organisation to ensure that people are treated fairly. The Tasmanian deer farmers are not opposed to this levy. They were part of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia when the decision was taken to support this initiative. But they do have questions about the way in which the organisation is being run. They are concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By improving investment and getting a better product turnover in the primary industries in Australia, which I believe this levy will help achieve, all Australians will benefit. If primary industries in Australia are vibrant, dynamic, competitive and have an edge in world markets, then all Australians benefit. I believe that this industry is one which can be competitive in the world markets. It may not be a large primary industry sector in Australia as time goes on, but it can be competitive. As it is competitive, and as people use their skill and creativity in marketing the Australian product better, the benefits from having a greater share of the world market will flow to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation. I believe that benefits will flow not only to the deer farmers of Australia, but to all Australians as another primary industry sector grows in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Mr Speaker, I will not take up the time of the House, because there is basic agreement with this legislation. I concur with the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). The deer industry is a small industry, but I think it has a very strong future, and it can be a very competitive industry in world markets. A recognition by the industry of its ability to so compete is demonstrated by its preparedness and its urging of government to support this legislation. I welcome the Opposition's support for the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two points are worth while commenting on. First, I note that there have been differences within the industry about the legislation. I join those who have spoken before me in urging that the industry sort out those differences, because if it is to compete effectively, if it is to take advantage of opportunities, it is important that it do so with as united a front as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to comment on was raised in the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) yesterday. It concerns the issue of double dipping. He wanted me to reaffirm on the record that it was not the intention of this legislation that a producer who had paid a levy in relation to deer velvet for the domestic market should subsequently incur an export levy. I can confirm that it is not the intention for double dipping to occur, and I direct his attention to clause 6(2) of the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill, which clearly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No charge is imposed by this Act on deer velvet on which levy has already been imposed by the Deer Velvet Levy Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that meets the point of concern that has been raised. I thank the Opposition for its support. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Supply Bill (No. 1) 1992-93 seeks interim appropriations of $12.383 billion for the beginning of the next financial year until around 30 November 1992, by which time the 1992-93 Budget Bills should have been passed. The Supply Bill (No. 2) 1992-93 seeks $596m over the same period, while the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1992-93 seeks a further $53.1m for the ordinary annual services of the Government and the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday saw the release of the Commonwealth Government financial transactions statement for February 1992. The year-to-date analysis in that document showed that the cumulative Budget deficit to February was of the order of $12.5 billion. This compares with a figure of $4.017 billion for the same period last year. The cumulative Budget deficit to February was thus $8.509 billion greater than that for the same period last year. This is a massive variation and it would be surprising if this could be fully accounted for by the many irregularities that occur in the pattern of a government's annual outlays and receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession is clearly having a continuing, and largely unacknowledged, impact on the Commonwealth Government's finances. Total outlays are running at 1.6 per cent higher than the considerable growth of 5.7 per cent in 1990-91 projected in the recession Budget for 1991-92. This includes Newstart and Job Search allowance payments, which are running at $1.534 billion higher than over the same period last year in order to pay for the army of unemployed created by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;our own Mr Recession&mdash;and his Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Revenue collections have fared even worse under the impact of the Government's recession. Total taxation revenue collections are running at minus-8 per cent as against the 2.1 per cent fall forecast in the 1991-92 Budget. So, once again, we see Budget forecasts being way off track. Tax receipts are down across the board, net PAYE receipts are down 5 per cent, and prescribed payments system receipts are down 19.6 per cent, giving us some indication of the depressed state of the building industry. Company tax is down 11.6 per cent, withholding tax is down a massive 42.7 per cent, and sales tax collections are down, a more worthy but still worrying, 2.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the only areas of tax receipts to show an increase are those not directly related to economic activity, such as the fringe benefits tax. Customs duty and the coal export duty, amongst the most iniquitous of the current range of taxes, have also shown increases of 2.3 per cent for imports and 23.4 per cent in the case of the coal export duty. Both of these taxes are to be abolished under the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These percentage increases and decreases are of even greater concern because they are additional to the recession figures for outlays and revenue of late 1990 and early 1991. But these figures are interesting not simply because they reveal the depth and extent of the recession forced upon us by the Government but also because the shortfalls in tax receipts could have been much worse if recent Tax Office boasts about revenue windfalls are anything to go by. For example, earlier this month the Tax Office bragged that it was expecting a windfall of $300m from taxpayers who failed to claim the expected deductions to which they were entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a strange boast, Mr Speaker, since it is indicative of taxpayers being unable to cost-effectively calculate their deductions and entitlements and meet the associated substantiation requirements. Self-assessment certainly livened the country, but it is not well, nor is it equitable if more tax is being paid by individuals than is rightfully required under the law. For many taxpayers it is simply cheaper to pay the tax than spend valuable time and money calculating their entitlement to a tax deduction, and subsequently having to argue their case with the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also means that the Commonwealth budgetary situation would have been $300m worse off by the end of this financial year if it were not for this tidy little&mdash;albeit disreputable&mdash;windfall from the Tax Office. The same can be said of the Tax Office claim of $1.3 billion extra taxes being netted by the large case audit program of Australia's top 100 companies&mdash;another bonus for the revenue. But the Budget deficit is nevertheless set to explode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach to the conduct of fiscal policy during the recession has been grossly irresponsible as typified by last week's fiasco in introducing Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92. My colleagues in the coalition well recall that it was not so very long ago that we were being browbeaten by a government claiming to be the paragon of fiscal virtue. The Government was running a Commonwealth Budget surplus and close to zero public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told in one Budget Speech by the then Treasurer, who is now, regrettably, the Prime Minister, that fiscal policy was to be turned into the Government's No. 1 weapon against the current account deficit and inflation. But the Government claimed to be making a massive deposit in the savings account of the nation&mdash;remember the words, remember the rhetoric? But no sooner did the Government hit the rough and all the talk of fiscal rectitude went straight out the window. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A huge turnaround, and we see it time and again. We are now told that the surplus was not immutable. It had been before, but, all of a sudden, it was not immutable. We have been told that the run-down in the surplus and the emergence of a Budget deficit was cyclical and not structural. Of course, this implied that there never was a structural surplus to begin with, only a cyclical surplus, since there was no surplus to speak of once the recession had collapsed revenues and blown out expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the collapse of our economy, the cyclical surplus of the past, built largely on increased tax receipts from strong economic growth, turned into a cyclical deficit. But instead of seeking to counteract this situation, the Government is now heaping a structural Budget deficit on to the cyclical deficit through the unfunded spending contained in the `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that the Government's original Budget deficit forecast contained in the 1991-92 Budget was $4.732 billion. This figure was revised earlier this year to $6.3 billion and then to $6.8 billion only a few weeks later to take account of the $500m to be spent in the current financial year as a result of the `One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that this massive turnaround in the Commonwealth's finances does not even begin to take account of the increased spending in the Government's `One Job' statement. We were informed by respected private sector sources before the release of the `One Job' statement that the Commonwealth Budget deficit could blow out to as much as $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although aware of these dire predictions and not prepared to contradict them, the Government has subsequently embarked upon a massive program of totally unfunded public sector spending under the `One Job' statement. All told the Government will be issuing $20 billion in new debt for the `One Job' statement spending over the next few years&mdash;$20 billion of new debt. This is nearly a 60 per cent increase on Commonwealth Government securities on issue at the present time, which amount to $35 billion. So in one fell swoop it will add another $20 billion to that debt over a few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are, of course, dependent on the costs of implementing the `One Job' statement being in line with projections and upon the Government's economic productivity and revenue growth fantasies being realised. Given the Government's track record, we have every reason to expect that the Budget deficit, subsequent to the implementation of the `One Job' spending and the new debt required to finance it, will greatly exceed Government estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget what Senator Walsh had to say about the Budget estimates contained in the `One Job' fairytale. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table.</PARA>
<PARA>You can bet your life on that! We know where it came from. In other words, the Government has again cooked the books, this time on the projected surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of serious concern to all Australians. It is also a matter of concern to their children and to their grandchildren, who will be obliged to repay this debt, plus interest, over future years. We on this side of the House do not value Budget surpluses or balanced Budgets for their own sake or necessarily as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By increasing the supply of Government bonds, the Government, however, forces down bond prices, which in turn increases interest rates. These higher interest rates increase the cost of capital to the private sector and thereby put in jeopardy the new investment spending essential to pull us out of recession and to ensure sustainable economic growth over a longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all indicators pointing to a slow and weak recovery, we simply cannot afford to put at risk new investment spending because of avoidable higher interest rates. Since private sector investment is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than private sector consumption, that investment will suffer disproportionately to private sector consumption spending from higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of public sector investment, only the $1.1 billion in new infrastructure spending contained in the `One Job' statement could be strictly characterised as public sector investment. Most of the remaining unfunded spending contained in the `One Job' statement is for public consumption purposes. The new debt being issued by this Government thus favours public and private sector consumption over public and private sector investment spending, both through higher interest rates and through direct government spending for consumption purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday we saw the release of the most recent figures on private new capital expenditure in Australia. They show that private new capital spending in the December quarter declined by 11 per cent from the September quarter and 14 per cent from the December quarter 1990. This was in an environment of falling interest rates, not the rising interest rates we can expect following the `One Job' statement. The significance of this is that without greater spending on investment we will not generate the future income stream from new productive investments to pay for this debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Government has committed a greater proportion of our future income from existing investments to debt service requirements. We are again committed to borrowing from our future income to finance consumption today with little offsetting provision for greater flow of income in the years to come. This situation might be summed up by saying that we are poorer as a result of this new public sector debt devoted to current consumption spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some of the non-infrastructure spending contained in the `One Job' statement has investment characteristics. My good friend at the table, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), would be aware that the increased spending on education can be regarded as public investment in human capital. However, the returns on such spending accrue to private individuals, not the Government. Returns on these investments are thereby alienated from the Government and cannot be considered offsets against the repayment of public sector debt. Future generations of taxpayers will be obliged to pay for the bulk of the Government's current investment in particular industries through spending on education. Even in the case of new infrastructure spending, the rates of return on these investments will probably leave much to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Job' statement is perhaps most notable for the absence of the wide range of structural reform measures needed to make the Australian economy more efficient, more competitive and thereby more productive. The rates of return on public sector capital spending, to the extent that they can be calculated in the absence of conventional accrual based accounting in the public sector, are far from being comparable with those attained in the private sector. Through the `One Job' statement we risk creating a series of infrastructure white elephants that will be more of a burden than a help to the Australian economy unless we address the whole range of key micro-economic reform issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we address the issue of work practices on the railways, for example, the rail spending contained in the `One Job' statement will not deliver satisfactory returns to taxpayers. Until we tackle the reforms needed to take place in coastal shipping we will not even know whether rail is an appropriate long term investment, given that, by reforming coastal shipping, it might be more efficient to transport some goods by sea rather than by rail. The contrast between the Government's ineptitude and the approach taken by the coalition in Fightback is telling. We are committed to reducing public sector debt by some $13 billion through our Fightback package. The retirement of debt financed out of current consumption spending serves to increase our net wealth, since a smaller proportion of our future income is mortgaged to debt servicing. In other words, we are wealthier to the extent that we can use the Federal Budget to retire public sector debt; that should be self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we will aim at maximising the return on public and private sector investment by tackling the full range of structural reform issues that have been neglected by this Government over the past nine years. One of the most important of these reforms will be the reduction in protection to negligible levels by the year 2000 and the associated phasing out of customs duties. This is in sharp contrast to the Government's cynical back flip on protection and industry policy ahead of the Wills by-election later this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The argument being put by the Government that tariff protection is appropriate for some industries but not for others is both ridiculous and dangerous. It completely ignores the arguments that have long been put for zero tariffs. The case for zero tariffs has nothing to do with the particular needs of the domestic industries currently enjoying protection. Zero tariffs are about Australian consumers being able to buy goods at the cheapest available prices and ensuring that our domestic industries are internationally competitive. If Australian industries are unable to compete with further tariff cuts at the present time, it is because of this Government's failure to deliver on key micro-economic reform and its failure to address the impact that business taxes have had on the competitiveness of goods produced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the coalition's Fightback package addresses both these issues in a comprehensive way. The Treasury analysis of the coalition's Fightback package supported the coalition's claims about relief to be made available to businesses through the abolition of taxes on business. In the case of the manufacturing sector, this relief amounts to $5.37 billion in total, according to the Treasury, which equates to a 2.86 per cent reduction in costs. How long is it since we have seen a government able to effect a reduction in costs in this country? That is exactly what is both possible and intended in the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were genuinely concerned with the long term viability of these protected industries, it would implement the tax reform proposals contained in the coalition's Fightback package rather than seeking to lumber Australian consumers with the job of supporting inefficiencies through higher prices. When I talk about Australian consumers, I mean everyday family people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Government's proposed tariff reductions, the Industry Commission estimates that consumer prices will be kept at 4.2 per cent above the level that would prevail with negligible tariffs as the coalition proposes. This is comparable to the CPI impact anticipated from the coalition's tax reform proposals. Indeed, it is greater than the price impact anticipated by Treasury to flow from our tax reform proposals as spelt out in Fightback. The Government's tariffs alone are a greater burden on consumers than are the coalition's tax reform proposals, including the goods and services tax. The Prime Minister risks increasing this burden by opening the door to other currently unprotected industries which now have every reason, at least in their own minds, to demand similar levels of protection to those now enjoyed by the car industry, the textile, footwear and clothing industries and manufacturing industries generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for free trade was made centuries ago and is not some latter-day invention of the so-called economic rationalists, those bugbears of the Left and of the Luddite Right who now lurk in the pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine and elsewhere.

<PARA>Similarly, Benjamin Disraeli was led to observe early in the nineteenth century that protection was not only dead but damned. Unfortunately, Disraeli was only half right in as much as protectionism is still very much with us; but he was entirely correct in so far as he referred to the death of protectionism as a credible idea in the minds of intelligent men and women. The dead and damned epitaph is entirely appropriate, however, in describing this Government's approach to industry policy and the costs it forces upon Australian consumers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How would the honourable member know? It is this palpable lack of commitment to structural reform on the part of the Government that makes its increasing resort to deficit financing all the more alarming. The lack of structural reform puts at risk our ability to provide the productive capacity that will be required to service the debt and provide a decent standard of living for future generations. There are thus good reasons for favouring a Budget surplus to retire public sector debt and for favouring a balanced Budget as a rule of fiscal policy over the longer term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return for the fiscal excesses of the `One Job' statement, Australian taxpayers can expect very little, except more pain. Not only will the increased public sector debt from the `One Job' statement put at risk the economic recovery, and thereby the jobs of many Australians; the nature of the proposed income tax cuts in the `One Job' statement will also ensure that those fortunate enough to have jobs and earning around average weekly earnings will receive little or nothing by way of tax relief. Because the `One Job' statement maintains the existing tax brackets for low to middle income earners and contains no commitment to the return of revenue derived from bracket creep, these people will end up paying more tax as a result of the `One Job' statement as inflation erodes the value of the $5,400 tax free threshold and pushes some of them into higher tax brackets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly true of the millions of Australians earning $20,700 a year or less. A worker on a wage of around $20,000 a year will lose as much as $12 a week due to bracket creep under the `One Job' statement. This entails, of course, accepting the Government's assumption of a low inflation rate of around 3 per cent, a rate which may turn out to be significantly higher, depending on the extent to which the Government through the Reserve Bank accommodates the `One Job' statement fiscal stimulus in its handling of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bracket creep in the lower tax brackets will result in a revenue windfall to this Commonwealth Government of $1.5 billion, with a similar amount accruing from a reduction in the real value of the remaining tax brackets.

These tax cuts will result in someone earning $100,000 a year being about $2,464 a year better off. While higher income earners are also entitled to some tax relief following the Government's PAYE tax grab during the 1980s, the fact remains that it is low to middle income earners who have fared worse under the present Prime Minister and who are most in need of relief from personal income taxes at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the coalition's Fightback cuts are concentrated on those with low to middle incomes, starting with an increase in the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000. The tax cuts for people earning $25,000 a year or less under the coalition's Fightback package range upwards from 25 per cent to 100 per cent.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister, in his usual way, rhetorically asked in Question Time what the coalition would do about its Budget surpluses once it had redeemed all of the government securities on issue, knowing that the question could not be answered during Question Time. It is a ploy of the Prime Minister when playing to our friends in the press gallery. An obvious answer to that question would be to give these funds back to their original owners, namely taxpayers, through personal income tax cuts. But I can assure honourable members that that would not occur to this Prime Minister. It is interesting that the Prime Minister thinks that any surplus funds in the hands of the Commonwealth need to be found some special purpose if there is no Commonwealth debt to redeem.

Oh, yes, it was the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). He was an economic failure in 1983, but is now masquerading as the saviour of the world's problems.

The answer to one of the questions was that Australia's first national strike in 1976 protested against changes to Medicare.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to mention quite a few things. One thing which I believe will gladden the hearts of those Australians who are battling out there during this recession is that tomorrow we will see the start of the bonus payment. More than two million families who are entitled to receive family allowance will get that extra bonus, starting at $125 for a one-child family and ranging up to $250 for a family with four or more children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I would also like to praise the Government and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). I am delighted, and so is my electorate, about the progressive improvements being made throughout the length and breadth of the electorate of Hunter. A new day care centre in Cumberland is going full steam now and is much appreciated. The new hostel for the aged in Cessnock is to open next month, and that will be a boon for the town. The hostel for the aged in Merriwa is well on stream, and improved aged care facilities are also proceeding in Singleton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have one grizzle which puts me in a pretty foul mood. For the past seven years I have been battling to achieve better social security arrangements for the people of the upper Hunter. It is intolerable and totally unacceptable that the people of Scone, Muswellbrook, Singleton, Merriwa, Denman and a host of other townships should have to depend on the Social Security official who visits Singleton for two hours and visits Muswellbrook on one day for two hours. That is just not good enough. In my opinion, it is shameful that people who cannot make contact with Social Security officials during those brief periods have to travel to Maitland to gain assistance with social security problems. The people in the bureaucracy in the Department of Social Security do not seem to understand that not all unemployed people own cars; nor do they seem to have any appreciation of the distance and the time involved in travelling to Maitland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, the Minister decided that additional Social Security offices would be established in New South Wales and I was confident that either Muswellbrook or Singleton would gain a guernsey. However, my electorate missed the boat, and that is why I am spitting chips over that issue at the moment. However, the fight is not ended and next Monday I will be having a conference with the regional manager and other top personnel in Social Security. Some harsh words may be necessary, but I am determined to gain better social security services for the deserving areas of my electorate and those areas which are about to become part of my electorate as a result of the redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see what is occurring in my electorate. I try to gain benefits, but sometimes those benefits are not appreciated. I refer to a bypass of the town of Muswellbrook. I am not quite sure of the population of Muswellbrook, but it is a lovely little town and a busy little town. It is in the heart of the coalmining area. I guess it has a population of about 12,000 to 14,000 people. But its main street is absolutely crazy. There is a viaduct which allows the railway line to run over part of the main street virtually and, with the passage of coal trucks and the other heavy traffic through Muswellbrook due to the fact that it is on the New England Highway, which is now the national highway, it is impossible to make oneself heard if one stands in the main street. I believe that businesses are suffering as a result of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the idea behind the national highway as enabling people to get as speedily as possible from point A to point B. We have bypassed so many towns. I was reared for a time in a small town on the north coast, Nambucca Heads. That town is bypassed completely now. People to whom I have spoken in that town have no concerns because business has not suffered. All of the towns on the south coast of New South Wales used to have the main road going through them, but they have been bypassed; Goulburn is to be bypassed; Mittagong is to be bypassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it will be a wonderful thing for the people of Muswellbrook when their town is bypassed by the national highway. However, a few business people up there are concerned, and I understand their concern.

There is a $20 billion expenditure blow-out in the One Nation package, with the Government giving no idea of how it will fund it. I am not a great devotee of opinion polls, but not surprisingly the opinion poll evidence is very clear that Australians will not be duped any more by this kind of cynical politicking of which they have got so very, very tired.

I think that is all the evidence we need to prove that the One Nation  statement will, in the end, do nothing to create jobs in this country, nothing to reduce our historically massive level of unemployment and nothing to resolve the social crisis that goes with unemployment, because it is not going to inspire businesses in this country to invest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Confederation of Australian Industry, which I think all would agree is one of the two major industry associations in Australia, said of the One Nation  statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic statement is not about economic management. It is political from top to bottom.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One ultimately becomes wary of trying to fit all of the pieces into a coherent recovery strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>The review of the Confederation of Australian Industry published in February, very soon after the One Nation statement was released, gave it the most damning indictment imaginable. So, too, did a recent report produced by the Centre for South Australian Economic Studies in what is called its March briefings. It does briefings on a quarterly basis. It has confirmed many of the things that we and people in the business community have said about the One Nation package. It says some rather flattering things about the Fightback program, which I suppose I should read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but I want to concentrate on the main point here, and that is the criticism of the One Nation  package. What the Centre says is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The One Nation scenario appears on the face of it to offer an unsustainable growth rate over the period 1993-96. It would appear that the One Nation scenario is too optimistic about the net export performance, and hence the growth prospects of the Australian economy over the period 1992-93 to 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The One Nation scenario is too optimistic. The growth rate it projects in the medium term, if they were retained, which we doubt, would cause a blowout on the current account of the balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the Centre for South Australian Economic Studies, which is run by Flinders University and Adelaide University. It has nothing to do with politics or party politics, but it is a damning indictment of the credibility of the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Centre is saying is that not only is it a document that is totally unfunded but also it is not an economic document but just a political document.

He says, `I doubt that it'&mdash;the growth, the scenario&mdash;`should be taken seriously'. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if it is going to be taken seriously, that's a formula for very largely repeating the mistakes of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>That is when tax cuts helped fuel an overheating economy. I will not continue to quote, but he goes on and on and on, damning the One Nation statement in exactly the same way as the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies does, in exactly the same way as the Confederation of Australian Industry does, in exactly the same way as the 7,000 members of the  Australian Chamber of Manufactures do and in exactly the same way as the great Australian public does&mdash;46 per cent of them think it is a complete wash-out, a fraud, and only 28 per cent of them, the diehard Labor voters, think it is any good at all. I would have to say it is a `One Nation, One Job' statement which is really swinging in the breeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, however, since it launched its One Nation statement has decided that it would rather not talk about it too much. We had a few days of frenetic activity, talking about the monarchy, the flag and all these sorts of things. This One Nation statement was launched the day after the attack on the monarchy, the flag and the British involvement in the Malay Peninsula in 1942. The Government does not concentrate on what it believes to be the main agenda of politics today. The main agenda is the coalition. The Government is not really very interested in telling the Australian public about its own policies or about what it is supposed to be, the Government of Australia, with still one-third of its parliamentary term remaining. Government members are not out there talking about that. They are not in their offices formulating policies designed to further the broader interests of this country. They are running around Australia trying to scare the pants off people over the coalition's Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in the heart of the Labor Party there is a recognition that much of the Fightback program is precisely what Australia wants. Let me give some examples. We propose in the Fightback program to get rid of the current ramshackle consumption tax system that we have in Australia. Yes, we have consumption taxes in Australia&mdash;sales tax, payroll tax&mdash;which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Every time we take our cars to a petrol station, we are going to a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. Every time we do this, a third or so of the price of the petrol that we buy at the service station is simply coming back here to Canberra for the Prime Minister and his colleagues to splurge all over the country trying to win votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that we will get rid of that consumption tax and replace it with a simple across the board goods and services tax. We will get rid, for example, of the wholesale sales tax. What can one say about the wholesale sales tax? Somebody back in 1985 said that there are three main advantages of a consumption tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions and fails to tax the services sector. Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose. Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community. The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax is a crucial design feature. It will assist both administration and compliance. For business this is a simple tax. They will also benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks.</PARA>
<PARA>That, I think, sums up very well why we believe we need a broadly based consumption tax in Australia, which we call a goods and services tax, instead of the existing ramshackle indirect tax system above all of the sales tax. That, one might think, was a quote from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), or whoever it may be, but it was not. That was what the Prime Minister of Australia today said in 1985. If people believed him then, they would find him pretty hard to believe today. Of course, the Prime Minister changes as quickly as the opinion polls change when it comes to policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have time to detail more and more of them, but the list of quotes just goes on and on. The Treasury's so-called critique, which was motivated by politically based instructions from the officers of the various Treasurers as the Treasury was doing the work, proves the point. It says that farmers will be better off to the extent of over $8,000 per farm as a result of the Fightback package; that manufacturers will be better off by nearly $5 1/2 billion; that wholesalers and retailers will be better off by nearly $3 billion; that restaurants, hotels and clubs will be better off to the extent of $318m as a result of the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish the Government would go out and tell the public this. Why doesn't it? Because it does not have a skerrick of integrity. It should go out and tell the public that its own Department says in this document I hold in my left hand that taxes on exports under the Fightback program will be reduced by almost $2 billion, reducing the price of exports by 3 per cent and making Australia more competitive. That is what its own document says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just shameful the way the Government runs around the country, saying, `If you vote for the Liberals, you will vote for this terrible consumption tax'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Labor Party do? It taxes goods right across the board with its sales tax system. It taxes through the payroll tax system. Every time people fill their cars with petrol it rips 26c per litre out of their pockets. Through its tariff policy&mdash;which it is now apparently so proud of&mdash;it adds something like $30 to a pair of Reeboks, $12 to a knitted shirt, $32 to a jumper, $6.60 to a bra and $3.89 to women's panties. Those are a few examples of typical things that people buy which are all taxed by the tariff system to the extent of $650 per Australian per year. To claim that we will tax people, when we are abolishing that tax and we are abolishing six other taxes on top of that, and to claim that people will be worse off, is a fairytale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a blessing, I suppose, when some speakers stop. I would like to address the question of superannuation, because it and the way it is treated by the tax system has significant implications for government expenditure, which is the nature of the broad debate today on Supply. It has significant implications for government expenditure because of the generous tax treatment of superannuation by this and previous governments. It is an acknowledged form of savings, and governments therefore tend to encourage an investment in retirement incomes using the vehicle of superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was reading the Opposition's proposals for a new superannuation policy. I also read some significant criticisms by the superannuation industry of the Opposition's proposals for changes to superannuation. They are most disturbing indeed. The quotes I want to bring before the House today indicate that the Opposition is irresponsible in its treatment of superannuation as part of a retirement incomes policy. I will take much of my material from an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 27 March 1992. It reported on the proceedings of a seminar held only weeks before that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there is a fundamental principle on which the Opposition and the Government divide in respect of superannuation. The Government has determined for some years now that, wherever possible, it would make it compulsory for Australians to contribute to a superannuation policy or, through their work, have their employers contribute to superannuation&mdash;that is, to employees' savings. It is our view that a minimum amount of compulsion is essential to make sure that those savings are put aside for people's retirement so that some 20 years hence we do not have too many people falling back onto the pension system. It is absolutely essential that we have a minimum level of compulsion when it comes to putting away savings, and our preferred vehicle is superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, the Opposition is proposing to have an incentive-based system of contributions to superannuation. Not only do the Government and I have a significant difference of opinion with the Opposition here, but also the superannuation industry has real worries about this. No matter what level of tax incentive is given to people to contribute to superannuation, will they ever contribute sufficient money to promote their own retirement funds and keep them off the pension?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take honourable members to some remarks from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. The coalition believes that it can get people to save for their retirement by offering incentives. This is the view put by Senator Alston, the Opposition spokesman on social security matters. He believes that the Opposition policy will provide sufficient incentive to people to save for their own retirement. However, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia informs us through this article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no country where the provision of tax concessions has resulted in the general population saving enough for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no clearer statement, among all the good statements I have, as to how an incentive based system of superannuation contribution simply does not do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, we have encouraged a system whereby, through awards, it is compulsory for workers, with their bosses, to contribute money to their superannuation funds. We have some figures here. The ACTU Assistant Secretary, Iain Ross, mentioned at the Wollongong conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since the introduction of award-based superannuation in August 1985, the proportion of employees with superannuation entitlements has risen from 39% to 72%. For male workers, it has risen from 50% to 80.6% and for females from 24% to a staggering 78.5%.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the alternatives: an incentive based system, which the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia says simply cannot provide sufficient savings for Australians, or our award based superannuation system, which not only will provide the savings but also is clearly putting large numbers of Australians onto that compulsory system. Ray Block, senior economist at SBC Dominguez Barry, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax-induced super (the coalition's strategy) is unlikely to raise national savings significantly. At the incentive-driven margin it merely directs private savings from one form to another.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, Diane Ross, a partner specialising in superannuation with the legal firm Hunt and Hunt, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general consensus in the industry is that the policy is horrible to the point of being horrific. At the very least, the coalition has a lot further to go before they get it right.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary criticism of a major section of the policy of the Opposition, an Opposition that wants to come to government and implement a superannuation strategy which it claims will ensure that Australians put away sufficient money, through the vehicle of superannuation, for their own retirement. Clearly, a number of people who are in the business of providing superannuation say that it simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of these criticisms lies this fundamental difference between the Government and the coalition, and also between the coalition and just about everyone else in the superannuation industry: voluntary contributions on the Opposition side and a system of compulsion on our side. Quite frankly, the industry&mdash;as we have heard from Diane Ross&mdash;is aghast at the fact that, contrary to the experiences of other OECD countries with whom we compare ourselves, the coalition believes that voluntary contributions will enable Australia  to supplant the age pension with superannuation. Ross Christie, chief executive officer of the Local Authorities Superannuation Board has commented on this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History shows that a voluntary superannuation scheme just doesn't work. The coalition's policy is about as silly as asking people to voluntarily pay their taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>With the best will in the world, few people&mdash;with the exception of myself and others&mdash;pay their taxes voluntarily. People gripe about it. But the Opposition is expecting us to believe that, with a little bit of incentive, people will voluntarily contribute sufficient money to their own retirement savings to provide for them 20, 30 and 40 years hence. Christie goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bulk of the population simply don't have the financial resources during their working lives to make voluntary contributions. As someone said at Wollongong, disposable income to these people meant they might be able to buy their children shoes.</PARA>
<PARA>Christie echoes the thoughts of others in the industry&mdash;and this is an exceptionally good report by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>&mdash;when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only rationale he can perceive for the coalition policy is an ideological commitment to freedom of choice. Certainly, the ACTU believes the coalition's policy is driven by a fervent opposition to award superannuation, somehow believing that these industry funds will give the union movement excessive influence over investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been hearing that one for a decade, I suppose, in my involvement in the trade union movement. There has been no evidence to date that the trade union movement seeks any special control over superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if you like, there has been some debate between the Government and the ACTU from time to time as to what role trade union leaders would play in the management of superannuation funds. It is trade union leaders who say to us, `Hey, don't fiddle around and direct where we should make these investments, because we have to get the best return for our investors, that is, trade unionists'. So trade union leaders, when placed in a role the same as anyone else who manages superannuation funds, generally come up with the same sorts of answers and questions. They want to make investments that return sufficient money to their people&mdash;to trade unionists. So I do not understand the sort of drive, on the part of the Opposition, to have an incentive based superannuation system that clearly, on the advice of a number of people from the industry, will not provide sufficient funds. The most damning statement in this article is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is a widespread belief&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in the industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the coalition is opting for a policy that runs counter to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think one can be more damning than that in a criticism of the Opposition; that it has a policy that runs counter to the national interest. The national interest in this case is, of course, to raise the general level of savings. That is an objective that the Government has and has heralded any number of times. But we might return to our friend Ray Block. He makes a further comment, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the ultimate concern; how is Australia going to generate a large increase in savings and, in particular, in retirement savings? The coalition's proposals are not plugged into any savings models. They constitute a bare minimum retirement benefits, rather than a plan of imaginative action for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are my concerns, too; that there is a certainty, were the Opposition to be elected, that all our hard work in the last six and seven years trying to get people into mainly award based superannuation schemes to ensure that they put money away for their retirement will be ruined by this system of taking away the basis of award based superannuation. It is also my concern that the Opposition, if elected, would have no further legislation in the form of the superannuation guaranteed levy, which we have introduced, but would shift across&mdash;diminish the national effort, basically&mdash;by using this very weak method of incentive to get people to put away for their own savings. As we have heard, people do not voluntarily pay tax and they do not, by and large, voluntarily pay for their own savings unless, of course, there is an enormous and overwhelming contribution also made by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move now to some more particular and finer criticisms of the Opposition's proposals on superannuation. One element of this proposal is that there should be a $6,000 per year contribution cap that individuals could make and, as a consequence, if one is to propose a cap to the level of contributions that individuals can make to their own superannuation year by year, of course, one has to take into account the fact that people do not work all of their lives&mdash;they may leave the work force and then come back&mdash;so that they have to make some amendments to their scheme whereby people can make a catch-up if they fall behind in their contributions. That, in itself, is absolutely sensible. But I just want to take us through some of the difficulties with that contribution cap and the catch-up arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury has done some work for us here and has worked through this. Rather than quote Treasury first, I will quote some people from the industry itself. I quoted the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia before and it is absolutely scathing in its analysis of the $6,000 contribution cap which the Opposition touts. It notes, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limit on rebatable contributions will prevent most people from making adequate provisions for retirement through superannuation. It appears to have been based on a premise that a member would make contributions at this level throughout his&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I should say, `her'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">career. However, the coalition acknowledges that most young people show little interest in voluntary superannuation and that young marrieds would, in any case, be better off by paying off their mortgage rather than saving through superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not agreeing with all of that element, I might say. It goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, most people will have little more than 20 years to save for retirement and, at $6000 a year, will not be able to produce a sufficient benefit to support them in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the difficulty that we have with this proposal. This sort of cap arrangement may actually deny people an ability to put away sufficient funds for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to figures prepared by Westpac Financial Services Group, a person who wants to live on a retirement income that was equal to 75 per cent of his salary would have to save 17 per cent of that salary over 40 years. To achieve that level of income over 20 years&mdash;a more realistic saving period&mdash;the person would have to put away 41 per cent of salary. A person saving 20 per cent of salary over 20 years, which is an scenario envisaged by the coalition, would end up with a retirement income of only 37.5 per cent of salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the superannuation industry will always argue to have more moneys flowing through its network. I understand that, but here is a decent and very real criticism of the Opposition's desire to put a cap on the level of savings per year that one can contribute. We have some difficulties with the proposition that a person should try to catch up and make contributions, say, later in his working life if he finds that he has not put away enough for his own retirement. The first is that the proposed catch-up arrangement will, by and large, be of greatest benefit to the higher income earners, as this group is likely to be best placed to afford the catch-up contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also find that the Opposition has a desire to simplify all the superannuation arrangements, which is a very decent thing to do. We share that desire, but we find that its particular arrangements here for catch-up will be complex to administer and police because of the necessity to maintain records of superannuation support received in each of the preceding five years, and it may provide insufficient scope for people who have not had the opportunity to contribute to superannuation. This is a major concern of ours, for example, because people have been out of the work force and that will be true for many women. They may not be able to make the catch-up contributions in order to fund for them what will be an adequate retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed $6,000 limit on total contributions will be difficult to administer and, for individual taxpayers, difficult to understand. I might just work through one or two examples. This will be particularly the case for members of defined benefits funds and unfunded superannuation schemes where the level of employer support received cannot be readily quantified. We argue that the problems will arise where employer contributions do not vest immediately and people may be denied rebates and taxed at higher rates on other contributions because of contributions that they ultimately do not receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there is no indication in the Opposition's documents of how the $6,000 will be distributed where a person makes a personal contribution and receives employer contributions or where a person receives employer support in several funds. The rules will be required to determine which contributions are to be rebateable first and this will, undoubtedly, involve complex deeming rules or complex notification requirements for fund members. I get calls in my office from people who are already worried about the complexity of the superannuation scheme and I do not doubt that this will double the number of calls in any member's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is against me. I ask members of the Opposition to please reconsider their obsession with using a very weak mechanism of tax incentives to encourage Australians to put sufficient money away for their retirement. It has not worked in any other advanced nation and the industry has told them it will not work. I am suggesting that the Opposition will have to back off from its policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

They possess a diffused yet active scientific and technological research base in the private sector as well as within large defence related industries. The market pull in these countries is nothing short of fantastic compared with similar demand for competitively driven research and development in this country.

I fully understand that the success or otherwise of restructuring will also depend upon the response of management and its openness to explore the investment timeframes related to research inputs. There will be a steep learning curve, no doubt, but there will not be too many choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this, I would therefore wish to outline the continuing role of the CSIRO within the context of the coalition's overall industry agenda. There is sometimes an impression that the scientific and technological issues trail the mainstream economic debate. This is a simple fallacy. The object of the coalition's policies will be to remove the legacy of past policies which have largely created a profoundly constricted industrial and manufacturing base with little interest in technology acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparent myopia of much of Australia's industry in respect of the potential relevance of the public sector research community is not symptomatic of industries elsewhere. When the CSIRO and other public sector research agencies confront the indifference or disinterest in the private sector to its activities, it is directly experiencing the legacy of the past. They are not experiencing a market failure as such; they are encountering structural problems which result from government failings. Until the various structural concerns are overcome, our nation will never advance on these concerns and its energies will be expended through frustration and the search for contrived solutions to fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the scientific research community be on the inside of these issues. There will be no sudden upturn in industry interaction with the research community until the private sector as a whole is driven to seek out technological based solutions to its market difficulties, until business is hungry for technological innovation, and until there is a basic impulse to search out the best science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do think we are deceiving ourselves and the wider community if we think we are ever going to reach any meaningful change if we continue to talk endlessly but never do anything on a massive across the board scale to boost private sector investment in research and development. It is an easy thing, and a constant temptation, for politicians to stitch together a cute initiative here and there and announce, `The problem is under control'. But, invariably, the media binge washes off and the problem in all its bluntness re-emerges in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a community we have been chasing these issues around for years. Political pressures build up and explode, a few million is spread across the research effort and there is a feast of self-righteousness by all involved. At some point, however, all of us have to say, `Enough! I want the basic, underlying problem fixed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, then, how do we as a nation try to build the innovative private sector which is so crucial to the construction of a large scale internationally significant research and development effort? What is characteristic of a powerful industrially based R&amp;D capacity? Recently CSIRO headquarters published and disseminated the thirteenth David Rivett Memorial Lecture by Professor Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford University. It is a wonderfully brave and commonsense look at what makes for competitive, knowledge intensive economies&mdash;an issue vital to the life of the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Professor Rosenberg turned the common wisdom on its head by showing that science rich countries are not necessarily those which are technologically intensive or apt to use technological innovation to build their competitive positions. In fact, he found that there was an inverse relationship between those countries which produced Nobel Prize winners and their comparative economic performance. Copies of the CSIRO's occasional paper No. 6 can be obtained from the organisation for interested members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside the complexities of the argument, Professor Rosenberg accepts that there is no model performing economy. Some countries do have high growth start-up companies achieving new sales based on new product lines and niche markets. Some have essentially mature industries which have upgraded product cycles, found new design opportunities and grabbed some extra efficiencies in their production processes&mdash;cameras, motor cars and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the common thread running through all these performing economies is that they have a collective, almost primal, urge to compete and to build new and rebuild old markets. It is this instinct, this elemental impulse, that is absent in this country. It is an old phrase, I know, but governments do not create wealth or produce or innovate&mdash;private firms do, small businesses do, conglomerates do. What creates an industrial culture which does this? It is businesses which are conscious of and striving to match international best practices and win against international competition. The best firms, the firms which have a smell of the global market and all that requires of them, are the most innovative. They are the ones that look instinctively to science and technology in one way or another to grab an opportunity, to elbow into a new market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more to it than this, though. If it were this simple, then a quick lowering of tariffs would bring about a miracle in industrial restructuring. But such a process must be underpinned by a massive across-economy boost to industries&mdash;rural, manufacturing and service industries alike. There must be a dramatic reshaping of the total cost environment or landscape in this country which saps scarce resources from such areas as research and development and spins them off into Commonwealth tax takes, or squanders them in wasteful on-costs. This fundamental reshaping of the production environment is the central intention of the coalition parties. It involves shedding $20 billion in company costs, which currently runs into Government coffers. It involves winning another $30 billion in gains from boosting productivity across the entire economy. This is the big game: this is where the fundamentals are remade, the environment in which new instincts are born. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely, in this country, if I were to walk out onto a public platform and announce an unfunded research initiative of, say, $100m, I would be praised. I could then say I was onto the problem and all would be well. It says a lot about a community and the media that politicians are allowed to get away with this stuff. I could bask in the sun a bit and, even when the past started to rear its head, I could get away for, say, 12 to 24 months by referring everyone to my track record and claiming previous initiatives were still working their way through the system. It is easy to do. It is a great temptation for the non-performing Minister in the non-performing economy presiding over the languishing research base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want a vital change in the culture of business so that R&amp;D is seen for what it is, a vital tool for creating wealth and providing for sustainable growth, then we have to do some heart surgery on the economy, or perhaps a spinal tap or the like. Business must be competitively poised. It must be subject to driving forces of change, technology and global competition. But it also needs the biggest across-the-board fully funded cash stimulus in this nation's history&mdash;a multi-billion dollar direct shot in the arm, which Fightback provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the scientific and technological community want to finally do something about the fundamental obstacles to creating a powerful industrial base in this country. The scientific community understands the critical importance of competitive economic performances to the take-up of research and the application of new technology. But it has watched enough Government Ministers pontificate to it about this road to Damascus. It is wondering whether it is really there. Well, it is not there, and it will not be until it is built. To build it, we  have to use the tools of public policy and we have to want to accept the scale of the undertaking and all that means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO is integral to this larger task. As I said in my opening remarks, the reservoir of expertise in this organisation will be critical to the nation's ability to capture the benefits of the changes I have touched on. Economic restructuring is intertwined with technological change. The CSIRO will continue to play a clearly important role in respect of its continuing work with established industries such as mining and minerals processing and agriculture. Not only are these areas in which Australia enjoys something of a comparative advantage but they are industries with which the CSIRO has already cemented relationships. This in itself is critical to the commercialisation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pace of technological change and the rate at which market structures shift or new opportunities emerge is speeding up. This presents challenges to the whole manner in which we go about conducting commercially oriented research. Much early research is already being integrated into the latest stages of the R&amp;D process. Hence, any commercial linkages the organisation seeks will require even closer relations with user groups in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of what I have said so far, I will no doubt have created anxieties as to how the coalition conceives of the balance of research within the CSIRO. While I am adamant that commercialisation of technology will remain high on the agenda, my interest is mainly in making current efforts more effective. It does no great good to push the CSIRO into providing a subsidised service for short term industry research needs; that is the meagre end of the greater national need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though I understand that the private sector has short term commercial needs that the CSIRO should be able to meet, there is much more to the game than this. Industry needs to learn, in the context of an economic environment that makes it receptive to learning, that the strongest industries are those which possess a strategic vision of their business plan. Similarly, I believe that the CSIRO must be able to retain and build upon its strong strategic research base. Innovation in management, as in research, is a product of planning and seizing hitherto non-existent opportunities. It is about prudent investments over time; it is about patience. Even in a crude instrumental sense, the CSIRO will best serve the community in the medium and long term by keeping alive its potentially most powerful capacity; that is, its capacity to seize the leadership in a given area of research. That capacity ultimately resides in its strategic research effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubts that the organisation, if it directed its research exclusively into near market research, would benefit the industrial base in many ways. But to what benefit and for how long? It would most likely, by and large, yield incremental developments on existing technologies. We need incremental developments, to be sure. They will be especially important in consolidating the position of Australia's primary industries. But we also need a research base which will draw industry into new dimensions of technology and into new areas of market development. Research of this type will be fired by imagination. The retention of a sensible balance of research within the CSIRO is therefore crucial to achieving this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this basis, if Australia is to build an effective and lasting commercialisation or technology transfer process, it is one which must come to draw on a strong, competitive, strategic research effort. I know that one of the by-products of the CSIRO's current commercial research activities is that industry is building confidence with regard to the role of research in its business plans. There is a long way to go, I realise. The recession has compounded the problem, as has the rural crisis. I know that this crisis has hit sections of the CSIRO directly. As a member representing a country electorate, this is an issue about which I need little education. The more general recession has had a wider effect still. Businesses are disinclined to look beyond their core business plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the various rural research corporations have restricted the resources at their disposal owing to falling commodity prices, but the process of working with the private sector, for all the stresses it has placed on CSIRO's researchers and research managers, has been the only practical means of breaking into the commercial world. It has been the only way of demonstrating the unambiguous capacity of the CSIRO to directly benefit business outcomes. It has been, and will continue to be, an effective means of sending the message to industry that a commitment to higher levels of investment in R&amp;D over a longer period would yield even greater benefits. It is working, though sometimes the CSIRO might feel entitled to question the pace and extent of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition talks of the hopes it has for commercialisation strategies, it is not simply talking of the rapid fire transformation of research into commercial products. It is, instead, looking to build a partnership between the public sector research organisations and the private sector, which is based on a shared view of the role of strategic research. Moreover, it is looking to build the environment which will see industry recognising the value of investment in research which will capture significant proprietary returns down the road. If economic and technological restructuring are indeed to proceed hand in hand, if the nation is serious about rebuilding and redirecting its industrial capabilities, then this is the ethos which must guide it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) remains in the House and listens to my speech, he might hear me answer some of the questions he has posed in his speech to the House. I commend him for taking up the issue of the CSIRO. It certainly is the flagship of the research organisations within Australia and it is an organisation which all Australians can be proud of. The honourable member for Gippsland addressed several matters, including the need to boost business in the economy. During my speech I will be glad to canvass those issues and illustrate some of the areas where the Government is addressing them and where the Keating One Nation statement has also addressed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said that $20m is needed to boost the economy. I ask: how will that figure be derived? I guess that, as part of the doctrine of the GST, the coalition will relieve taxes on certain businesses and transfer them to those on lower incomes. I guess that will be the Opposition's way to boost the economy. If anything, the biggest sap on the economy in the last 20 years has been inflation and misdirected investment. I would say that the offer of a $20 billion boost to the economy, the Holy Grail, goes back to the old days of McEwen and tariffs and things such as that. Business has to have an incentive to go out and lead; it still has to be given a promise that it will get back something which no-one else is getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like, very briefly, to take honourable members through some of the changes that have occurred in the economy over the past 10 or 20 years. The Labor Government has gone through the pain of throwing out unnecessary government controls on banks, trade, capital and foreign exchange, which put the economy in a straitjacket for the past 10 or 20 years. The Labor Government has cut protection against imports, so our exports are proving to be cheaper and our home industries are forced to match some of the world's best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) commented on the export economy in dollar terms. The figures indicate that we are exporting more and that the export economy is growing. Because of the changes that we are putting in place, it will grow even stronger over the next five or six years. The Labor Government has entrenched an accord with representatives of some four million wage earners so that industrial disputes no longer shut down our industries and wage increases no longer force businesses to fire workers&mdash;probably one of the most important things it has done over the last five or six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lowered taxes and targeted spending so that Australia now spends less on government than do most other advanced industrial nations. We often hear parliamentarians&mdash;senators seem to have more time to trumpet throughout the States&mdash;say that we are a high taxing nation and that the Government is taking too much money. That is belied by the fact that we are a low taxing nation. I think we are second lowest of the OECD nations. That is the money the Government has to spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, I feel that by working together Australians have created about 1 1/2 million jobs in the 1980s while reforming the economy and opening ourselves to more competition. The Government has expanded the size of the economy by nearly one-third and has increased the average living standards of Australians by one-tenth. We finished the 1980s by exporting almost twice as much as we did at the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not deny that there were some useful lessons to be learned from the 1980s&mdash;some of them from our successes and, I do not mind admitting, some of them from our failures. Manufacturers have learned from our successes that they can put their products onto world markets and win sales. Later I will give examples of that having occurred in my electorate. Employers, employees and unions have certainly learned that they can work together to change the tired old rules which held back productivity and diminished the value of work. By learning to work together, they can transform the workplace in a way that increases pay, profits and the enjoyment of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can say that the lessons are equally valuable from our failures; some are old lessons and some are new. We have been reminded that we can still be bumped around by changes in the price of our exports and our imports, both of which are beyond our control. We have been reminded that our growth is, to some extent, influenced by the growth of our trading partners. We need to take into account not only our opinions but the opinions of foreign leaders in that area. The recession has certainly set us back, but the Government will not allow us to stop the clock. In the last two years Australia has lost about one-tenth of the gains from the 1980s. We have lost two out of every 17 jobs created in the 1980s and one-fifth of the gains of the average income in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The losses have been severe, but we can recover by building on the strong foundations that we have laid down. The recent One Nation statement has shown that over the next four years we will more than make up for those setbacks. We will create about 800,000 jobs, more than four times as many jobs as we have lost. At the end of the next four-year period, the economy is projected to be 10 per cent bigger than it was before the recession. We will do it without losing the great gain of low inflation. Nothing could give business people a greater boost than by keeping the inflation rate low. It is an honest boost to the economy, not an artificial boost by a transfer of taxes from one section of the economy to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to sustainable growth in the economy over the next four years will be workplace reform and the accord between the Government and the trade unions will entrench inflation to a rate equal to or less than that of our trading partners. That is the economic imperative and we should not lose sight of it. The introduction of a GST puts all those gains at risk and, in fact, they go out the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating statement is one of economic logic. It is a strategy of spending on substantial and necessary public investment now while private investment is weak, and bringing the Federal Budget back into surplus when that private investment is strong. The far-sighted projects that were offered in the One Nation statement will do just that. The Government's economic strategy is the 1990s is designed to maximise our strengths and remedy our weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not throwing tradition away; we are not throwing traditional industries to the wall. We will still remain an important producer of iron ore, coal, wool, beef and other traditional commodities. We have enormous potential in processing raw materials, such as aluminium and food. We can export high quality services, as we are doing successfully with education. Our tourism potential is enormous, as the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), would no doubt agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will still be a world leader in commodities by the year 2000. We retain a fundamental comparative advantage in those areas. It would be stupid to squander that advantage by not recognising it or by not exploiting it. The Keating Government's goal is for an internationally competitive economy that continually strives for world best performance, an economy that provides equal opportunity for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to canvass a number of initiatives in the One Nation statement that will go a long way to providing support for export industries. I believe these government policies need to be reiterated because business people certainly need to be informed about them. I would like to commend an organisation in my electorate, the Murwillumbah Business Enterprise Centre, for doing its part in education by holding seminars for some of the industries in my electorate. Those industries have taken up the challenge and are looking to export, and in some cases are already exporting, to Asia and thereby providing much needed export dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the initiatives the Government announced in the 1990s that have been built on by the Keating statement are those that are helping business people to invest. The recently announced special investment allowance will help internationally competitive major projects to start in the near future. That allowance will be available to benefit individual development projects worth more than $50m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new pooled development funds will improve the availability of capital for small and medium sized Australian firms to develop their ideas into commercial products and processes. The PDFs will also provide opportunities for investors across the spectrum to participate in the development of Australian ideas and thereby help to revitalise industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Technology Group also was announced in the One Nation statement. As everyone knows, too few of our research successes have been kept in Australia; too often they have been let go. To help us reap the commercial reward from our ideas, an Australian Technology Group will be specially created to bid for the rights to publicly funded research projects and help them into business. I commend the Government for this project. Essentially the aim of the ATG  will be to link good research ideas and good business. It will be in addition to the 125 per cent reduction for the cost of research and development that is a permanent feature of the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage new investment, foreign investment guidelines will be somewhat streamlined, leading to the start of new projects, especially in the resource sector. In particular, in order to help large projects get started, the environmental heritage reviews, which are often required for big projects, will be simplified somewhat, although that does not mean that the Commonwealth and State reviews will lead to a single assessment for big projects. Certainly, the idea of the small unit to help people go through the morass of paperwork involved is another initiative which will get projects started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland has commented on the need to boost the economy. I mentioned that probably the most important thing was the maintenance of low inflation which sees investment directed into the particular industries which will return a steady and productive income to Australia. We had the good old days of high inflation: the rip-roaring inflation, the you-beaut investment in quick returns, the quick buck which built office blocks and giant holiday towers not far from my electorate. Hopefully all that will wash out of the system as we mature and move through the 1990s into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maintenance of low inflation is a fundamental economic requirement because it will encourage investment in productive industries. One has only to glance back, as I mentioned, to the 1970s and the 1980s to see where much of that investment went. The buildings and enterprises that benefited from that investment did so because of support and misdirected investment as much as anything else. The investors in that type of industry now may be somewhat shell-shocked&mdash;a description I have used before&mdash;but they can no longer rely on the quick return, or marry their taxation or investment portfolios to a quick return from inflation. They have now got to look for the steady productive enterprises in which to invest, and I believe it is the cautiousness of those businesses that has led to the decline in investment. As soon as they are either re-educated or regain confidence we will see an investment surge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland on his comments that export confidence is essential to economic recovery. That is why we have tripled money available for performance bonds from some $50m to $150m. It will provide a form of insurance for firms undertaking contract work overseas. It will do this by helping them to meet performance bond requirements where banks are unwilling to actually advance bonds without some formal security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extra $18m was also provided for 1992-93 under the development import finance facility which will enable Australian exporters to become more competitive. In particular, the Austrade international network will be extending its export access program. That program is proving to be of great benefit and a great boost to industries right around Australia. It has been boosted from $4m to $12m over three years to assist those small to medium businesses to get into the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is an accepted fact&mdash;I think on both sides of the House&mdash;that it is the small to medium enterprises which play a vital role in actually improving Australia's export performance. They are the ones that are particularly well placed to contribute to new areas of export activity in the high value added goods and services sector. In fact, I think it was back in the Budget of 1991 that support for this particular program was first announced. It is specifically targeted at those assisting export and international businesses. The funding increases there will boost participants from the present 200 to around 700 through the life of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also see improved access to the program by businesses in all States and regions of Australia. This will enable additional markets, particularly in Asia, to be targeted. The access program provides participants with a comprehensive package of training and practical assistance in developing successful export activities. It includes such things as assistance with preparing an export plan, identifying potential overseas buyers and preparing an undertaking through an overseas market visit. I commend the Minister for the initiative and for the work that has been undertaken there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supply Bills that have been brought into the House are for the appropriation of some $12 billion or more. It is an incredibly large amount of money, but I know it is to tide government spending over from July through to November 1992. It also brings into effect some of the extra initiatives that have been accounted for in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention the Employment, Education and Training portfolio and the extra money that has gone into that and into the labour market programs&mdash;the $166m&mdash;for the assistance to job seekers in industry, flowing from initiatives previously announced in that 1991-92 Budget. In particular, the labour market programs are proving most beneficial in my electorate. The Skillshare program, which is targeted at the long term unemployed, has been of tremendous assistance there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen Skillshare programs in Mullumbimby, Murwillumbah, Ballina and Byron Bay. They are taking on people who have been unemployed for quite some time and they are getting success rates of about 50 to 60 per cent. It does not sound like a great deal, but honourable members should consider the numbers that are going through Skillshare and the fact that without this particular government assistance these people would stay on the unemployment benefits. I hope the Opposition can change its mind about dissolving Skillshare, because it is a successful program in the sense that it does pick up those people who have been unemployed for quite some time and gets them back into useful, productive employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of these Bills is the $73m which is going to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to assist with Commonwealth employment, education and training projects&mdash;particularly Commonwealth development projects such as the CEEPs. They have also been a great success in my electorate&mdash;or just out of my electorate where some of the people have gone to work. Again, they have been of tremendous benefit in helping people's self-esteem and helping them play a productive role in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) at the table, I would be very remiss not to mention the veterans in my community who have come to my office and thanked him for the changes that he has made in the portfolio, in particular for allowing veterans to get first-rate hospital treatment within the community. Rather than having to travel all the way to Sydney or Brisbane, they can now stay with their family and get that assistance in their local town. I thank the Minister for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I would like to address in the little time that I have got left is the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio and the money that has gone into infrastructure support for the rural adjustment scheme. The assistance is timely and it certainly has been well received. The other aspect of spending is within the CSIRO. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I doubt whether since Federation there has been such a clear choice between the two major party groups. We will be presenting our GST Fightback package offering an exciting vision for Australia, which has had a remarkable acceptance already within the community. It appears that the Government will be offering little more than its One Nation statement, which I believe is its fourth statement within a year. This indicates to me that it is becoming increasingly desperate and is incapable of making any of the real changes that are needed to turn Australia around. It is only fiddling at the edges. The most extraordinary thing about the One Nation statement is that it was totally unfunded; there was not a cent of funding in it. You would think that if the Government had learnt anything in recent times, it would have learnt that expenditure has to be funded. Not funding it blows out the current account deficit and adds to the economic woes which have been foisted upon us during the term of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

Before the vote to depose Bob Hawke, he apparently told half the Party that he would support the mining of Coronation Hill if they would support him, and told the other half that he would not allow Coronation Hill to go ahead if they supported him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in recent days a 180-degree shift on tariff protection, which I will talk about later, but there was one analysis in one of the newspapers this morning which said that if you paid every textiles, clothing and footwear person who loses a job $100,000, that would be cheaper for Australia than to stall the program of reductions that the Prime Minister has announced in recent days just so that he can gain some supposed kudos during the Wills by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the Prime Minister misleading the Australian people on the economy. On numerous occasions he is on the record as saying that we would have no chance of a recession, when he apparently knew from Treasury advice all along that that was to come. His track record as far as results go is the worst of all time. I think nothing epitomises this more than the overseas debt, which in net terms has blown out from about $23 billion when he assumed the Treasury benches in 1983 to a net debt today of $145 billion&mdash;a sixfold increase. What a shocking indictment it is of the policies that he has thrust upon Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, of course, he is telling us that the recession is over. If he would come out to country areas of New South Wales, certainly to the areas which I represent, people would tell him that the recession is not over, that they are in a depression which is worsening and will probably continue worsening for the next 12 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at some of the figures. Private sector investment for the December quarter was down to 5.5 per cent of GDP, which is the lowest on record. On top of that, we have the One Nation statement being based on totally unrealistic assumptions of growth and productivity. No-one believes these assumptions. Senator Walsh, the former Finance Minister, has confirmed that over the last day or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is little more than a dash for growth policy with a Federal election looming in the next 12 months or so, if not sooner. There are many dangers in such a policy. There are dangers that it could stimulate areas that will not be particularly useful to Australia in the situation we find ourselves in, such as overstimulating housing. This dash for growth policy will have undoubted effects on the exchange rate and inflation. It will aggravate the current account deficit, the overseas debt, which will lead to upward pressure on interest rates again. The bond markets themselves are already indicating this and surely this is the last thing we need for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the Prime Minister doing about our economic situation? All he seems to do is shift ground further as political pressure mounts in different areas. The Wills      by-election has been a classic example of this. We have had the unedifying spectacle of the Prime Minister preaching to this chamber the exact opposite to what he believes in. Does anybody in this chamber really believe that he thinks what he is saying is true on this shift on tariffs? We did have similar shifts many times in the past. I do not think there has been any greater shift than the shift he made when he supported GST back in 1985 to the shift today where he is supposedly opposing a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has dozens and dozens of quotes on the record that he made back in 1985 when he was Australia's strongest advocate of a GST. I would just like to quote one speech he made to the National Press Club on 5 June 1985. I will read some of these quotes at length because honourable members would probably think it was John Hewson or Tim Fischer making some of these statements. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . There are three main advantages of the [consumption] tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful "net dividend" for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Then later in the speech he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax is a crucial design feature. It will assist both administration and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . For business, this is a simple tax. They will also benefit from no longer carrying the cost of the wholesale tax which they pay and have to finance on their stocks.</PARA>
<PARA>And later still:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it has come to the crunch, short-term political interests have always come first. But I think it is fair to say that, at least to some extent the community as a whole has been prepared to let its politicians get away with that attitude.</PARA>
<PARA>And lastly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The result has been across a whole range of areas, that Australia's economic performance has been below par. The country has not been working to the peak of its achievable capacity because we, as a community, have not been prepared to let it do so. There is no more glaring example of this than our existing tax system. It is decrepit and in a state of virtual decay.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is: the Prime Minister of Australia talking about the need to adopt a goods and services tax back in 1985. John Hewson himself could not have said it better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have another shift in recent days on tariffs. Only a few months ago he was telling John Laws on radio of the necessity to cut tariffs&mdash;all tariffs&mdash;to zero per cent and when we queried him about that in the Parliament, what does he say? `Oh, that was only on radio. I was only using generic terms on a John Laws radio program'. In effect, he said you cannot take a show like that seriously. The fact is that he has been saying throughout the decade of the 1980s that tariffs are poison and has made many gung-ho statements to that effect and then comes into the chamber and announces a 180-degree shift in policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has lost his credibility in this Parliament entirely. He has lost his respect; he has lost his dignity. This is a sad situation for Australia. His principles bend like a reed in the wind. If the political wind blows in one direction, he structures the rhetoric for that; and if it blows in another direction, he crafts his rhetoric for that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first to admit that I was not a great fan of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, but at least he commanded much more respect from the Australian people and had a greater rapport with them, and he would not have sunk to this sort of level. I believe that the present Prime Minister's logic, even in his shift on tariffs, is quite defective and inadequate. If he wants to change his mind on tariffs, I think he should come in here and openly say so, instead of inventing obviously false and concocted reasons that he expects us to swallow. I think it only makes him look foolish and demeans his position. Indeed, it reflects badly on all politicians; we are all dragged down by this type of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He comes in here and says, `Tariffs in one area were at 270 per cent. We have reduced them to 15 to 25 per cent and that is beneficial'. I would agree with that, but he says that to reduce them from the 20-odd per cent to zero is suddenly wrong. To bring them from 270 down to 20 is okay but to bring them from 20 to zero is going to be disastrous. That is not only economically illiterate, it is mathematically illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also says that if we keep the tariffs for these industries at 15 to 25 per cent, it is going to preserve them. If it going to preserve these industries, why have companies like Nissan suddenly closed their doors and gone back to Japan when they are holding a tariff much higher than this? If a 20 per cent tariff is going to keep these industries in Australia, why not double it to 40 or 50 per cent and keep a few more industries in Australia, and start a few more up? Surely we have been down that path, have heard that argument, and all of us have seen how fallacious it is. I believe the Prime Minister knows this. Why he is not honest with us is quite beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other factors are much more important as to whether an industry stays in Australia or not. The exchange rate shifts that we have seen many times over the last few years have a far greater effect on an industry's profitability and, of course, the industrial relations rigidities that we have in this country are far more important to industry's profitability. If the Prime Minister genuinely wants to do something about keeping industries in Australia, he will free up some of these rigidities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the classic example in Shepparton in Victoria with the SPC canning factory. There, because of these ridiculous industrial relations practices, they were going broke&mdash;there were bad management decisions as well. But what happened? The management went to the workers and said, `If we continue on this way, none of us will have a job in a few months'. The workers, being the commonsense people that they are, negotiated with the management and they came to a sensible enterprise agreement which would save that factory. John Halfpenny, bless his heart, heard about it and watered down that agreement. But, even with that watered down enterprise agreement, within a short few months the productivity of that plant has been lifted 35 per cent and more; it is back in the black, it is distributing, as I understand it, profits to workers; and it has a future, whereas it had none last year. That is the sort of thing that has got to be put in place if we want to keep industry in Australia, not shifting positions on tariffs as the Prime Minister has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the textile, clothing and footwear industries, there is, in effect, a 40 per cent equivalent consumption tax on these industries because of tariff protection. Who is that hurting? Is it hurting Kerry Packer; is it hurting Bond over in Perth? I think it is hurting the poor of Australia more than it is hurting the rich. It is affecting the average man in the street, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we going to do about this? On the coalition side, we are going to remove these taxes. Customs duties will phase out by the end of the decade because we believe that the poor in this country are today paying more in tariff taxes than they are in income taxes, and that is totally inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These consumption taxes that the Prime Minister supports only hurt exports. If you have got tariff protection on your industry, it builds in inefficiencies; it ultimately and inevitably raises your costs. That means that it puts you at a disadvantage on the world export market where it is very competitive. That lowers your economy of scale and restricts your vision to the domestic market, which is quite small in Australia because of our population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, tariffs are inflationary because they lift prices higher than they otherwise would be. That has an upward pressure on the exchange rate which in itself is detrimental to exports in this country. Tariffs&mdash;I think everybody admits this, even the Prime Minister&mdash;lead to inefficiencies for Australia and a lower standard of living for us all. All tariffs do is shift jobs and resources from one industry to another, from one occupation to another and from one region to another, and the export industries of this country, which we need so badly to turn the country round, are hurt the most, because they ultimately carry the cost burden of the high tariff protection. There is no net gain of jobs from tariff protection, but there is a net loss of wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the debate about the mess that we are in that the Government should adopt many of the coalition policies in this country. I have already mentioned the need to have a large shift on industrial relations. I believe the Government should come out now and adopt the GST Fightback package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all about jobs, as the shadow Minister for Tourism says, and knows only too well. I guess if we went out of this place and asked the Australian people what is wrong with the tax system today, they would say three things: they would say that taxes in this country are too high; the taxation system in this country is far too complex&mdash;I have old accountants in my electorate who are retiring prematurely because even they cannot understand the tax Act which is now about three foot high. The other thing wrong with the tax system is that the tax mix is wrong. We pay far too many indirect taxes vis-a-vis direct taxes, and that has to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST Fightback package addresses all those things, and corrects those things. If we take the wholesale tax system alone, we have got five scales in this country today. Five! We have zero taxes on some items, 10 per cent on others, 15 per cent on passenger cars, 20 per cent on other items and 30 per cent. There is no rhyme, reason or logic why one item is taxed at one level or exempted at another. All that is doing is distorting consumption and investment patterns. What we want to do is abolish all those scales and replace them with a flat one-level tax right across-the-board&mdash;a simple, visible, honest and open system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, to collect the same amount of money from abolishing our sales tax we would bring that level in at 7 per cent. But we intend to bring the level in at a higher level, 15 per cent, so that we can do other things and so that we can simplify the system even more and change the tax mix even more. By doing this we are able to abolish seven taxes in total: sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax, customs duties and so on, as well as lowering other taxes, such as fringe benefits tax and making the greatest slash in income tax in this country's history by 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have compensation measures in place for pensioners and families and we are lifting $20,000m of taxes off the back of business, and that will be the greatest kick-start to jobs in Australia today. The GST Fightback package offers a vision for Australia. It is a bold initiative; it is something that is well overdue to be done, and because of its simplicity and because it gets incentive back into the system and because it rewards production, it will be the greatest thing that this country has ever seen. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1575" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member draws our attention to what all Australians are entitled to believe is very good news for the economy. Of course, one has to be somewhat circumspect about relying entirely on one month's figures, but now we are so far into the year that we are able to make fairly confident predictions about the reliability of the estimates that were made at the time of the Budget last year, when it was forecast that there would be a current account deficit of $14 billion and there would be a surplus in the balance on goods and services for the first time since 1979-80.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the figures that have been released today, I think we are entitled to be confident that we will meet both of those forecasts. In the area of the goods and services balance, there has been a dramatic turnaround in Australia's performance over the last year. I think all of us, on this side of the House at least, are very gratified about that performance, even if the prospect of good news sends long faces onto the visages of those opposite. They are always wanting to predict more doom and gloom for Australia, and every time some statistics come in which confound them they are sent into a mood of depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first eight months of the present financial year, the goods and services balance has recorded a surplus of $1.2 billion. Of course, the constant refrain from those opposite is, `What would you expect at the time of a recession?'. What they mean by that is that imports would go down in the context of a recession. But the real reason why these figures are better is that there has been strong growth in exports. Exports are up by nearly 10 per cent. Therefore, we can now confidently say that this is a better trade performance not because of the recession but rather because of the structural improvement which is occurring in the economy&mdash;the kind of structural improvement which I referred to yesterday and before in terms of the better export performance of our manufacturing industries in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only need to remind ourselves of the dramatic improvement that we have seen in terms of manufactured exports, which went up by 111 per cent in our last five years, compared with 47 per cent in the last five years of the Fraser Government. If we look at the area of sophisticated manufactures, we find the comparison even more stark. In our last five years there has been export growth of 145 per cent, compared with just 47 per cent in the last five years of Fraser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it is even more astonishing that we should have the honourable member for Barker, the shadow Minister for industry, indicating that he is about to scuttle those programs which have been so important in encouraging an improved export performance. What he has said in this Parliament is that over the years ahead, if he had a chance, he would actually demolish the export programs which have been so important in terms of turning Australia's export performance around. Austrade would be scuttled. The export market development program would be scuttled. DIFF would go. EFIC would be scuttled, and so it goes on. Yet these are just the programs, valued at about&mdash;</PARA>

By not overdoing the pace of structural adjustment imposed upon the heavily protected car and TCF industries in electorates such as Wills, the March 1991 programme raises the chances that the wider dismantling of protectionism will "stick" politically.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly right. The Government has taken from 1988 to the end of the century to phase down industrial protection and, at the same time, give the car industry incentives to export. At the same time, it picked up adjustment programs in TCF to give them a chance to adjust, so that the reforms will stick.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Older People and Their Banks</EMPHASIS>. While I do not agree with all of the substance of that report, it does reflect a very real concern amongst older Australians, particularly pensioners, about the services they are receiving from the major banks. The report did find that many pensioners were forgoing considerable income because the savings accounts in which they had their moneys were paying less than the maximum rates of interest. Moreover, while these things have to be set against risk, convenience and availability of services, it still appears that many pensioners are getting less than they could get from other similar, secure financial institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report made a plea for the institutions to make publications for pensioners and older people easier to understand so that the account charges, the conditions and rates of interest would be fully understood by existing and potential older customers.

The report makes it clear that the pensioners do not want fancy images and glossy brochures, all peppered with terms which often they cannot understand. They want simple, straightforward information provided by polite, sympathetic and helpful staff. The report also goes on to criticise some of the fee structures, especially for customers who have frequent small transactions with their banks. It is clear, I think, from this report and to all those who are sufficiently interested to have read the views of the pensioners in this report, that the financial sector is under some challenge to improve its services, and I think in some cases to improve the perception of those services amongst older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, I took these concerns to the chief executives of each of the major trading banks last week in a series of conversations with them and asked them to review their services to older Australians to see whether they could provide a better deal for senior citizens. I urged the banks to become more pensioner friendly in the design of their accounts, in their publications, in the rates offered and the charges made. I put the proposals to each of the executives suggesting the possibility of dedicated services for pensioners through the banks, for cooperative development with both the pensioner organisations and my own Department in the provision of information and for wider consultation between the individual banks and the pensioner community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that, while the banks pointed out that they needed time to consider these proposals, I very much welcome their very positive response to these ideas and their very genuine commitment to developing better services for their pensioner clients. I look forward very much to receiving their responses prior to Easter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But certainly the result of these conversations with the leading executives in the banks encourages me very much to believe that some very worthwhile initiatives will emerge from the banks to meet the particular needs reflected in the report mentioned by the honourable member for Lilley to improve their services to what is a very valued group of their clients.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Issues paper No. 2 of the national health strategy review provides a comprehensive analysis of access to and financing of public hospitals in Australia. Its key findings are that Australia needs no more hospital beds&mdash;that we have far too many beds in our inner suburbs and too few in outer urban areas. A good example is the comparison of Sydney's inner west with growth corridors such as that in the electorate of the honourable member for Robertson in the Gosford-Wyong area or in the south-west.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, everyone involved in health care planning understands that we should aim to match hospital resources with the needs of people who live near them. We will therefore implement the core reforms in the national health strategy hospitals paper to ensure better quality and more secure health care. We are also in the process of negotiating integration of the Concord Repatriation General Hospital into the New South Wales hospital system. This will enable the redirection of resources to Sydney's south-west, where they are critically needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted with some interest that the honourable member for Lowe seems to have a somewhat different attitude&mdash;even a cavalier attitude&mdash;to the allocation of hospital resources. A recent article which may have escaped the attention of some honourable members, but certainly did not escape mine, appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drummoyne-Five Dock &amp; District News</EMPHASIS>. I have a copy here. It has a photograph of the Concord complex, a very large high-tech hospital complex which is very well equipped in terms of capital expenditure. The article is headed, `High Tech Health'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must have new hospital, says Woods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney's inner west must have a new `high tech' hospital to cope with the health demands of the coming decades, used not to replace existing hospitals but to integrate present services into a strong feeder system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the basis of a major campaign by the Federal Shadow Minister for Health and Federal MP for Lowe, Mr Bob Woods&mdash;a leading doctor in his own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gave details in an exclusive interview with District News.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Woods believes the Federal Government can easily find between $60 million and $100 million (the price of the Sydney Opera House nearly 20 years ago) to build the new hospital.</PARA>
<PARA>This, the honourable member for Lowe says, is peanuts. The fact that the hospital would be built in his own electorate gives us some insight into the motives of the honourable member for Lowe. Almost everyone knows that the inner west of Sydney does not need a new hospital, a fact clearly recognised by the New South Wales Government and all others involved in the delivery of health services to the region. Indeed, it would seem that the honourable member for Lowe is preoccupied with his own electorate at the expense of the broader needs of the people in, for example, Sydney's west. What an incredible example of pork-barrelling. What a blatant example of pandering to special interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that the honourable member for Lowe also displays a novel attitude to spending. The $60m to $100m he estimates is needed in public money is, in his words, `peanuts'; `the price of the Sydney Opera House' he says. Does this mean that all health expenditure decisions would be based on whether the cost is more or less than the cost of the Sydney Opera House? Will health be financed by a lottery?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also point out that the honourable member is hopelessly ignorant of the true costs of building this hospital. The latest high-tech hospital to be built in New South Wales is the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle which cost $250m. The operating costs of this hospital last year were $34m&mdash;certainly a lot more than peanuts. The attitude of the honourable member for Lowe is even more remarkable when we consider the Opposition's health policy, under which hospital funding to the States would be reduced by a massive $1.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a re-run by the Opposition of why it should be in opposition and what it did when it was in government. When it was in government, rather than developing capital resources for health on any sort of rational basis, essentially we had members who were either prepared to pander to the interests of the profession, the good doctors, or to pander to the special interests of the electorate.</PARA>

During your recession you have lost 12,600 jobs in the TCF industries, despite average effective protection of more than 170 per cent for clothing and footwear and around 70 per cent for textiles. Are you still claiming that you will not lose more jobs in those industries by the year 2000, when the rates under your current plan will be less than one-third of these? How do you explain, if low tariffs are now so bad, that the food and beverage industry has employed an extra 12,500 people during exactly the same time of your recession, with a 3 per cent effective protection rate with, in fact, negligible protection?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the honourable gentleman on about? He is the one who is arguing for zero tariffs. He is the one who is arguing that these tariff levels should be taken away. If he is trying to imply that the reductions in protection to date in the TCF industries has produced some structural decline in employment in that area, that decline would be enormous under a zero tariff level. The fact is that these industries have become a part of the employment base of this country, particularly in rural Victoria, in rural New South Wales and in some other places. They have become so under a policy of very high levels of protection, in the main with quotas, where the effective level of protection is infinity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government got rid of quotas. We have removed quotas and we are now on a phased reduction in protection for these industries and, with the work of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, funding for restructuring can occur, which will leave segments of the industry in a competitive position, but not in a position as competitive as that produced by a zero tariff level. We will end up with a declining protection from the 250-odd per cent to 25 per cent or 15 per cent tariffs. We will then see cheaper products for the Australian consumers, but still the maintenance of segments of these industries&mdash;the ones which can never be competitive will have gone&mdash;and possibly and probably they will be in areas of rural Australia where people rely upon these industries for their employment.</PARA>

We had the agrarian socialists, the National Party, going to country meetings shedding crocodile tears for farmers, while at the same time turning up at industrial dinners and picking up the cheques from the people they had handed the industrial protection out to. You were trying to run a scam&mdash;a duplicitous policy&mdash;kidding country people while taking the money through the back door from manufacturing industry, and trying to make the claim that the exchange rate, which was, of course, hugely overvalued in the 1970s, robbed Australian farmers of much of the wealth they should have otherwise enjoyed, because you believed in a managed exchange rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the question from that well known rural member, the honourable member for Stirling. It was a question about the impact of New Zealand shearers in Australia. Of course, I am aware in this wool week that this is a matter of great concern to some of those in the shearing industry in Australia. I say to the honourable member for Stirling that, under the provisions of Australia's double tax agreement with New Zealand, where a New Zealand resident shearer comes to work in Australia for a period of less than six months, Australia does not tax that income. The income is taxable in New Zealand. Where a New Zealand resident shearer works in Australia for a period exceeding six months, Australia taxes the income at non-resident rates. The taxation treatment is similar&mdash;in other words, it is reversed&mdash;in cases where Australian residents go to work in New Zealand. The residency of the individual is determined by the treaty. The Government is aware of the problems in the shearing industry and we wish to make sure that tax issues do not add to those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the CER review, the Australian and New Zealand governments are going to renegotiate the Australian-New Zealand double tax agreement, which, of course, is now quite dated. The appropriate treatment of New Zealand residents that come to work in Australia and Australian residents that go to work in New Zealand will be considered in those negotiations. This is a particularly important issue as we have seen emerge as a result of the CER arrangements essentially a common labour market stretching across the Tasman. Therefore, I think the reality of that common labour market needs to be reflected in the taxation treatment of the individuals working in either country. It is a matter that I will, with great pleasure, take up with my New Zealand counterparts in the context of reviewing the double tax agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, this week or last week, published a series of forecasts by the country's leading economists and econometricians in their own right and representing some of the organisations they work with, including banks, which showed overwhelmingly that the group of people surveyed thought that the Government's forecasts were in the middle of the range or thereabouts of their own forecasts. In other words, if one takes that as a representative group of people studying the economy and forecasting and commenting on the economy, they thought that the Government's forecasts over the period were entirely plausible. It does the Leader of the National Party no credit to take references from a particular institution which might disagree. I do not even know whether they are an accurate reflection, as the Leader of the National Party claims them to be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Calwell for my maiden foreign affairs question. I assure the Leader of the National Party of Australia that this does not reflect a violent mood swing. The Government is aware that the German Government has announced the suspension of arms deliveries and military assistance to Turkey on the grounds of its belief that German origin weapons were being used against the Kurds. I am not aware that any other country has taken similar action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned about the escalating level of violence in Kurdish areas of Turkey since 20 March. No official figures have been released, but various reports indicate that up to 80 people have been killed and up to 200 wounded in the course of actions by the Turkish armed forces against terrorist actions by the Kurdish Workers Party, known as the PKK. Turkish Government measures to date include the imposition of curfews and large numbers of arrests. The Australian embassy in Ankara is continuing to monitor the situation closely. On 30 March we directed our Ambassador in Ankara to convey Australian concerns to the Turkish Government, including urging the Turkish authorities to exercise restraint in any anti-terrorist action against the PKK, and to ensure that the human rights of the Kurdish people are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a long period Australia has closely monitored the treatment of the Kurds, not only by Turkey but also by Iraq. The Government is very concerned about reports in today's press that once again Iraqi troops have been deployed against Kurds in northern Iraq.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, in the course of Question Time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went out of his way to misrepresent my position in relation to the impact of the goods and services tax and our Fightback package on the prices of groceries and food.

<PARA>It is appropriate that the House focus today on the subject of Cambodia, and on the prospects for a lasting peace in that long-suffering country. Great crimes have been committed against the Cambodian people. The tragedy of the conflict has been brought home to us all through the personal witness of many Cambodian Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 February the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution formally creating the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia or UNTAC, the body responsible for implementation of the historic comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict. In response to the UN Secretary-General's request for contributions to UNTAC's operations, Australia has agreed to provide 495 Defence Force personnel to form the force communications unit. This total includes 65 communicators already deployed as part of the UN advance mission in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If conditions are right in Cambodia, the Government expects that the main Australian contingent will begin deploying during this month. They will be joined in the field by 40 signallers from the New Zealand Defence Force. Furthermore, Australia has provided UNTAC's military commander, Lieutenant-General John Sanderson, who commenced duty in Cambodia on 15 March. Australia will contribute six staff to his headquarters unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also expects to contribute to UNTAC's civilian component whose composition is still under consideration by the United Nations. As part of this, we have decided to provide 10 police officers. In addition, Mr Michael Maley, an officer of the Australian Electoral Commission, has taken up duty in Phnom Penh as Deputy Electoral Commissioner for UNTAC. The creation of UNTAC is the culmination of years of complex and difficult negotiation. The peace plan embodied in the remarkable agreements signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 provides a way of ending the nightmare of Cambodia's recent past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main objectives of the settlement are to end the civil war and to allow the Cambodian people to choose a new government through genuinely free and fair elections. Reflecting the complexity of the Cambodian conflict, the Paris agreements provide for an unprecedented and ambitious role for the United Nations in the implementation of the peace plan. UNTAC will have a peacekeeping role supervising, monitoring and verifying the cease-fire, partial demobilisation of armed forces and the cessation of external military assistance. UNTAC most definitely will not have a role enforcing or imposing the peace if hostilities break out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the civilian sphere, not only will UNTAC have a role in organising and conducting the elections, it will also play a role in monitoring and supervising the interim administration of the country to ensure a neutral political environment for the elections. In addition, the United Nations will be responsible for coordinating and assisting the repatriation and resettlement of some hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees and displaced persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cambodia peace settlement is a striking demonstration of the fundamental changes that have occurred in the international system. Unprecedented cooperation between the permanent five members of the Security Council has greatly enhanced the scope for resolving regional conflicts. The UN system has been able to harness broad-based support for its peacekeeping role. The subtle and dynamic balance of interests in the Cambodia peace agreements reflects the close involvement and cooperation of the permanent five members of the Security Council in the negotiating process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efforts of the Indonesian and French governments deserve special mention. Their initiative, courage and persistence were essential to the success of the peace plan. Great credit must also go, of course, to the Cambodians themselves. Those of us who have not known their suffering, or seen the evil they have seen, can only wonder what human qualities it takes to sit down and talk about the future, about peace, and about national reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia played a significant role in the long process leading up to the Paris agreements. In the mid-1980s, former Foreign Minister Hayden was active in regional diplomacy which sought to identify a basis for dialogue between the parties to the Cambodian conflict. In late 1989 Senator Evans played a key role in breaking the impasse following the first Paris Conference on Cambodia in July and August 1989. The core of Senator Evans's proposal, which was taken up by the permanent five members of the Security Council, was an enhanced role for the United Nations in the transitional period preceding elections in Cambodia. Senator Evans's resourceful and energetic pursuit of peace in Cambodia has earned him nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. It has also earned international respect for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving this motion today I pay regard to the achievement of Senator Evans and his Department. In light of our diplomatic contribution, it was appropriate that Australia was the first country to establish accreditation to the Supreme National Council, the interim body in which Cambodian sovereignty has been vested during the transitional period.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia was also among the first to supply troops to carry out the vital task of establishing communications and infrastructure in preparation for the deployment of the main UNTAC force. It is appropriate that we now help to see the process through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The return of Australian soldiers to Indo-China in the cause of peace is a matter for us to reflect on with justifiable pride. With peace secured in Cambodia, we shall be able to welcome the countries of Indo-China back into the mainstream of regional activity. We can confidently expect them to become part of the dynamism of Asia. Vietnam will now be able to emerge from its isolation and, with Cambodia, play its part in regional and international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In parallel with the improved prospects for peace in Cambodia, Australia will resume direct bilateral aid. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) announced today that, over the next four years, Australia will provide approximately $A49m in development assistance to Cambodia. This total includes $A23m for new bilateral aid. In addition, during this financial year we are providing approximately $A7.7m in disaster relief and assistance to displaced Cambodians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aspects of the comprehensive settlement have been criticised by some observers. It is suggested that it would somehow have been better to exclude the Khmer Rouge from the peace process because of its responsibility for the atrocities committed by the former Pol Pot regime. Involvement of the Khmer Rouge in the process does not reflect a judgment by the Australian or other governments that the Khmer Rouge can now be trusted. Rather, it reflects a realistic assessment that the only available effective way of containing the military threat it poses, and of ending the civil war, was to involve it and its main backers&mdash;China&mdash;as parties to the agreement. Put simply, a peace settlement without the Khmer Rouge and China would not be a peace settlement at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been suggested that the settlement could have been improved by providing for 100 per cent rather than for at least 70 per cent demobilisation of the armed forces of the Cambodian parties. Obviously such a provision would have been preferable, but the outcome set out in the Paris agreements is the best that could be negotiated.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the judgment of the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain, all significant Asian states and Australia that the Paris settlement represents the best available, realistic basis for a just and durable peace in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNTAC will be the costliest as well as the most comprehensive peacekeeping operation yet undertaken by the United Nations. It is expected to involve approximately 15,900 military personnel, 3,600 civilian police and 3,300 civilian administrators. More than 50 countries have been requested to contribute to this complex undertaking. The initial United Nations estimate of the cost for a duration of 18 months is $US1.9 billion. Australia's share of assessed contributions for this amount is 1.51 per cent, or $US28.7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also advise the House that Cabinet agreed in October 1991 to provide supplementation to the Defence budget of $A49m Australian dollars to fund the estimated costs involved in making our contribution to UNTAC and the United Nations advance mission in Cambodia. This is separate from our assessed contribution to UNTAC's budget, described above. We expect this will eventually be partially offset by reimbursements from the United Nations of some $A19.7m, but this will take some time to materialise. The final UNTAC plan and budget are now being scrutinised in New York by representatives of major donors, including Australia. It will be some weeks before the final budget is approved. Along with other donors, Australia hopes that, as implementation of the settlement proceeds, an increasing habit of cooperation among the Cambodian parties will allow savings in UNTAC personnel and costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the settlement is working. In the five months since it was signed, the remarkable thing has been not the number of violations or the number of disputes, but the way in which the Paris agreements have held firm, and the way in which the parties have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to the settlement in all its detail. Of course, there have been incidents which threaten the whole process, and the Government has viewed with particular concern the recent fighting in Kampong Thom province. But we must look beyond these hurdles without in any sense trivialising them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implementation of the peace plan may well prove more difficult than its negotiation. There are bound to be further setbacks. We should expect them and not be disheartened when they occur. The Government's decision to commit Australian forces to the Cambodian peacekeeping operation was not taken lightly. The UN forces will face risks from mines, from disease, from banditry, and possibly from fresh outbreaks of fighting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has assessed these risks and has weighed them carefully. It does not underestimate them, or the need to take every prudent precaution to protect our troops. We have made this commitment, however, because the opportunity to help restore peace to Cambodia is one which the international community cannot lightly let go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN commitment to help Cambodia also serves Australia's direct interests, and those of our neighbours, by helping to create a more peaceful and prosperous region. But it is important to emphasise again that Australian forces will not be participating in the UN operation in order to enforce or impose the peace in Cambodia. That is a task beyond the United Nations mandate. Rather, the Australian forces will be in Cambodia to help keep a peace on which the Cambodian parties themselves have agreed. That is the condition under which UNTAC is being deployed. It is the whole basis of the Paris peace accords. It is the condition under which Australian troops have been offered to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we conclude that there is no longer a peace to keep in Cambodia, the Australian and other UN forces will have to be withdrawn. But we do not expect that to happen. All sides in the conflict have invested so much effort in the peace process, and the Cambodian people have so much to gain from its success, that we think the prospects for a successful outcome remain promising. If we turn our backs on this opportunity to help consolidate the hard work of the peacemakers, we shall be sentencing the Cambodian people to further years of cruelty and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned already, UNTAC's primary military functions will be supervising and verifying the cease-fire, partial demobilisation of armed forces, and the cessation of external military assistance. UNTAC will also assist in the clearance of hundreds of thousands of mines. Australia's contingent will provide the crucial communications network for the UNTAC military operation. Our servicemen and women will be operating in a difficult and sometimes dangerous environment. Already Lieutenant-Colonel Russell Stuart has been wounded in the course of his duty with the United Nations advance mission in Cambodia. That incident underlines the risks which the peacekeeping personnel face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians can be proud of the skill and professionalism which the Australian Defence Force units have brought to UN peacekeeping and other operations around the world&mdash;from the Sinai, Iraq and the Red Sea, to the western Sahara and the Afghan border. Their reputation is reflected in the UN Secretary-General's decision to appoint Lieutenant-General Sanderson, commander of UNTAC's military force. I am sure all members of this House will join me in extending congratulations to General Sanderson on his appointment and in wishing him well in his assignment. I am equally sure that honourable members will want to express their confidence in and support for the Australian Defence Force men and women deployed in Cambodia. There is no more honourable duty than the one they will go to perform&mdash;to preserve the peace. We know they will serve Australia and the cause of peace with distinction, and we look forward to their safe return.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that that return will not be long delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the United Nations presence in Cambodia is not to oversee developments there indefinitely but to manage a transition from war to peace, from factional distrust to national reconciliation. May 1993 has been set as the target date for the United Nations organised elections. The UN Secretary-General intends withdrawing UNTAC about six months after that date. I know it is the earnest desire of all members of this House that the Cambodian people will seize this opportunity to establish a just and lasting peace in their country. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion before the House. It does so because the Cambodian people have suffered far too much for far too long and because they deserve to have every chance to secure a genuine and lasting peace in their country. A nation that has been racked by war, genocide and anarchy for decades deserves every opportunity for a better future. The Cambodian people have a basic right to live free from the fear of persecution and free from the horror of war. That is a right that has been denied them for over a generation. It is the right which needs to be restored in a real and enduring way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also supports this motion because our Defence Force deserves it. Its members are called upon to perform a professional job in the service of their country and they should know that, in doing so, they have the support, respect and best wishes of this House. We know that the professionalism and dedication to duty shown by the Australian Defence Force throughout its history will once more be demonstrated as it undertakes its work as part of the United Nations force in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I also take this opportunity to add the best wishes of the coalition parties to General Sanderson, an Australian, on his appointment as the UN Commander. We wish him well, of course, in this very difficult and challenging post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has consistently supported the peace process in Cambodia over recent years. That support has been genuine, constructive and positive in its purpose, but it has not been uncritical. It is that spirit of genuine and constructive, but not uncritical, support that motivates our response to this motion today. It is important, I believe, to set this motion, and the Opposition's response to it, in a proper historical context. Only by reference to how the situation has evolved can the real forces of change be identified, the real threats to progress recognised, and the consistency of the Opposition's approach demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the days of the Paris Conference on Cambodia, in July 1989, the Federal Opposition has welcomed a process that brought together the four Cambodian factions, the Hun Sen Government, Prince Sihanouk's faction, Son Sann's non-communist faction and the Khmer Rouge, as well as the United Nations Permanent Five, the ASEAN nations and Australia. In welcoming this process of dialogue and negotiation, we have consistently highlighted particular concerns. We have emphasised that an enduring peace would be achieved only if there was a settlement of the external factors, such as the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia, as well as internal factors, especially the civil war between the Cambodian factions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also emphasised that under no circumstances would we support the return to dominance of the Khmer Rouge and in particular its leaders, who inflicted such crimes against humanity on their own people in the 1970s. In fact, in November 1989 we called on the Australian Government to take the lead in supporting action in the International Court of Justice against Pol Pot and his associates for the crime of genocide. It is a matter of regret that the Government has never given that proposal its wholehearted support. The 1989 Paris Conference ultimately failed because the Cambodian factions could not agree on a power sharing arrangement. But a process had begun that at least held out a chance for a settlement that might endure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1990 the peace process ended a new phase when Senator Evans produced his so-called Red Book proposal for an enhanced UN role in Cambodia. This signalled the beginning of a high profile, activist role by Senator Evans in the Cambodian peace process. I should make it very clear that, although we on this side of the House have sometimes seriously questioned Senator Evans's judgment, we have recognised the positive contribution that he has made on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I have personally supported his role in many meetings that I have had with leaders in Asia and in the United States. But, as I have said, we have not been uncritical of Senator Evans, and I will refer in my comments today to some aspects of that criticism. I should also make it clear here and now that in our view Senator Evans has contributed positively to the search for peace in Cambodia and that we have supported him in that general endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A role for the United Nations in brokering a Cambodian peace was an option that had been canvassed for years before Senator Evans produced his proposals. He broadened it to include a role for the United Nations in the interim functioning of the Government of Cambodia because the factions were unable to settle on an appropriate formula. The Cambodian factions failed to agree on the Red Book proposals, but those proposals remained the basis for future negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset the Federal Opposition was supportive of an activist and constructive Australian role in that peace process, but we emphasised that without the involvement of the major powers and without pressure from them on individual Cambodian factions, Australia's efforts would always be of little effect. Throughout 1990 our concerns about the Khmer Rouge were reinforced. Its gains on the battlefield and its intransigence at the negotiating table during a series of failed conferences raised very serious doubts about its commitment to a negotiated political settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, we were deeply concerned at the prospect that the Khmer Rouge might be using the peace process to strengthen its own position on the ground and to enhance its own prospects for a return to dominance. The United Nations Permanent Five reinvigorated the peace process in August 1990 with a plan for a comprehensive settlement. The critical shift reflected in this initiative was a new United States activism on the issue and a new spirit of United States-Soviet cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcomed the comprehensive peace plan, but emphasised our continuing fears of a Khmer Rouge resurgence, our concerns at escalating fighting throughout Cambodia and our reservations about the practicality of the role envisaged for the United Nations. For almost a year, from August 1990 to June 1991, the peace process stalled. We expressed concern that Australian policy was showing signs of substituting unwarranted optimism for necessary realism. We attempted to offer constructive criticism and suggestions, including the exploring of other options for Cambodian peace in the face of increasing complexity of the situation on the ground and the inability of the four Cambodian factions and their backers to reach common ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The easing of tensions between China and Vietnam, China's decision to end its military support of the Khmer Rouge, and the  development of a greater spirit of cooperation among the Cambodian factions led to the critical breakthrough in mid-1991. Meetings in Thailand, New York and Paris towards the end of last year laid the basis for a negotiated settlement based on interim power sharing, a central supervisory and peacekeeping role for the United Nations, demobilisation of the factions, and national elections.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Opposition welcomed the signing of the agreement on a comprehensive peace settlement in Paris in October last year. We recognised the scale of what had been achieved on paper, but we cautioned realism about the difficulties of achieving fundamental changes in practice. Our call for realism was focused on the role of the Khmer Rouge in that peace plan. The only guarantees which the international community has ever had that the intentions of the Khmer Rouge are consistent with the terms of the peace settlement are the professions of good faith made by the Khmer Rouge negotiators themselves. Our fundamental concern has been the fact that such professions of good faith in the past have never been genuine guarantees about anything at all. It has been on these dangerous and shifting sands that the various ASEAN and Western plans to bring peace to Cambodia have been built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reviewed at some length the evolution of the Cambodian peace process. I have done so to emphasise the consistency of the Opposition's general support for that process. As much as anyone else, we have wanted to see a genuine lasting peace brought to Cambodia; as much as anyone else we want this current phase of the peace process to work. But our support has always been given with our eyes open. In addressing a tragedy on the scale of that in Cambodia, it is easy to let one's heart overrule one's head, to let good intentions be a substitute for good policy, and to be distracted from what is often the harsh and unforgiving reality in Cambodia. We have tried to guard against those delusions. The record of recent years shows that the consistency of our support for the Cambodian peace process is matched by the consistency of our concern about particular aspects of it. So we have come, over recent months, to the implementation of a comprehensive settlement and to the motion before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year the Australian Government contributed 65 Defence Force personnel to the United Nations advance mission in Cambodia. We regretted the fact that the Government failed to consult us, the Opposition parties, in the traditional way prior to the announcement of that decision. Nonetheless, we supported Australian involvement in the peacekeeping force, consistent with the support we have given to Australian participation in similar UN forces in the past. Over recent months planning for the main peacekeeping force, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, has been taking place. A prime ministerial statement on Australian involvement was promised by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) almost five months ago, on 5 November last year. Today such a statement has finally been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has re-emphasised specific concerns over recent days about the situation inside Cambodia and about the future of the peace process. It is against those concerns that the Opposition has assessed today's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). First, we have been concerned about the recent serious violations of the cease-fire by the Khmer Rouge and the dangers which those violations create for Australian defence personnel in Cambodia. The seriousness of those violations has been attested to by various observers, including the commander of the UN advance mission, the International Committee of the Red Cross, senior US administration officials and the Australian Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Head of the Supreme National Council, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, himself described developments this week as amounting to a very serious situation. In the light of these realities the Opposition has reiterated its concern about the intentions of the Khmer Rouge, its intimidation of civilians and its attacks on UN personnel. The Government's statement today attempts to address that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the Prime Minister's recognition in his statement that the recent fighting in Cambodia has been serious, that it has threatened the whole peace process and that the Khmer Rouge cannot be trusted. We welcome his acknowledgment that `implementation of the peace plan may well prove more difficult than its negotiation'. But there are other aspects of his statement in regard to this issue which we believe are ambiguous and incomplete. The Prime Minister has stated that the deployment of Australian troops to Cambodia will begin this month `if conditions are right in Cambodia'. However, he fails to spell out what those conditions are. He also says that `there are bound to be further setbacks' without specifying the level of danger that they will pose to Australian and other UN troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is an intrinsic difficulty for any government here. No statement of policy can be categorical, one way or the other, about the genuineness of the Khmer Rouge's commitment to the peace process. It is an issue which the United Nations will need to monitor closely and deliberately. It is an issue on which the Australian Government should exchange information, including classified information, more regularly with the Opposition than it has in the past. And I put that request directly to the Prime Minister today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask him to reconsider his Government's approach to our longstanding view that Pol Pot and his associates need to be brought to justice for their crimes. We have always believed that such action is necessary and appropriate, that it need not compromise a comprehensive settlement and that the Australian Government should promote it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second concern we have reiterated over recent days relates to the precise role of the UN peacekeeping force in general and the Australian contingent in particular. We have emphasised that its role should be one of genuine peacekeeping, not peacemaking and not peace enforcement. Peacekeeping works when the parties to a conflict are genuinely ready to make peace and when a cease-fire is genuinely in place. We have emphasised that both conditions need to apply when UN peacekeeping forces are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the assurances in the statement on this issue today and the recognition of the dangers our troops will face. In particular, we note the Government's firm statement that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we conclude that there is no longer a peace to keep in Cambodia, the Australian and other UN forces will have to be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say, however, that today's statement also leaves many critical questions unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government's understanding of the line between peacemaking and peacekeeping? Given that the role of Australian forces will include `supervising and verifying the cease-fire, partial demobilisation of armed forces, and the cessation of external military assistance', what are the rules of engagement for our forces, and will they be made public? What discretionary authority does the Australian commander have, and what matters must he refer to the Government for final decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important operational issues which define the limits of conduct for the United Nations and Australian troops. They are similar questions to those that were raised in the early days of the Australian involvement in the Gulf war. On that occasion, the questions were settled by the Government taking us into its confidence, keeping us informed and consulting with us prior to further decision making. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> We sincerely hope that similar questions now can be addressed in a similar way. And I ask the Prime Minister today to undertake the same level of exchanges of information and consultation as his predecessor did. Such interaction is the lifeblood of bipartisanship on these issues, and we hope that our continuing concern about the role of Australian forces can be the subject of further bipartisan discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the role which the Government has defined in its statement today for Australian forces in Cambodia is to change in the future, we believe that any final decision should be on the basis of consultation between the Government and the Opposition, and should be the subject of a separate statement in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third concern we have had relates to the period of deployment of Australian forces and the need to avoid an open-ended commitment. The Prime Minister has expressed today his hope&mdash;and it is just a hope&mdash;that the return of our forces will not be delayed. But no firm indication on timing is given, beyond the fact that the UN Secretary-General `intends withdrawing UNTAC about six months' after the planned election in May next year. Many people are questioning the realism of this UN timetable. If objectives take longer to achieve than planned, will our forces be deployed for longer than we currently expect? We look forward to close consultations with the Government on the implementation of the UN plan. We also expect that any extension of deployment by our troops will be the subject of a separate statement to this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, we have sought clarification about the level of commitments of personnel made by other countries to the UN peacekeeping force. The only information provided on this point in the statement is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . more than 50 countries have been requested to contribute to this complex undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA>We understand that, to date, the only major commitments of forces have been made by Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand. We look forward to clarification of the situation by the Government and to regular consultations with it on developments. There may be particular reasons why a more genuinely representative international force is not yet in place, but the Government needs to explain why this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, we have had concerns about the demobilisation of the Cambodian factions. In particular, we have sought clarification of whether full demobilisation of the 200,000 regular forces and 250,000 militia attached to the factions will be pursued, as recommended by the UN Security Council. We have also sought details on the arrangements for cantonment if there is not full demobilisation, and what guarantees exist that the factions, and the Khmer Rouge in particular, will not keep hidden military stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement today acknowledges that only 70 per cent demobilisation of the Cambodian armed forces is possible. The security implications of this decision and the arrangements for cantonment that now arise are complex and difficult issues on which we look forward to further information and consultations with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixth, we have had concerns about the level of funding actually committed to the UN operation in Cambodia. The statement estimates the total cost of the UN operation at US$1.9 billion, but it does not indicate what proportion of that cost has yet been formally committed. Our understanding is that only $35m has been contributed to date. Again, we look forward to clarification from the Government on that issue and to continuing consultations on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have had genuine concerns about the practicality of the responsibilities of government assigned to the United Nations and the detailed planning for it that has been made. There is little in today's statement, for example, about how the United Nations plans to take over particular functions of government in Cambodia, including foreign affairs, defence, finance, public security and information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There also seems a certain unreality about the timetable which envisages fair and free elections by May next year and the resettlement of 350,000 Cambodian refugees and 150,000 internally displaced persons by the same time. That means that refugees and others will need to be resettled at a rate of over 10,000 per week, even during the coming wet season. Once again, our concerns on these issues will need to be followed up with the Government in an open and cooperative way. The problem is, of course, that if the timetable is an unreal one, the cost of the UN operation will escalate significantly, the period in which Australian forces are to be deployed will be longer than is currently envisaged, and the dangers to those forces may increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we ask the Government to take us into its confidence on this matter and to provide us with regular and detailed briefings on the implementation of the UN timetable, on the level of funds formally committed to the operation and on the period of deployment for the Australian forces.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the situation changes in terms of the nature of the engagement of our forces, the level of Australian funding and the number of Australian personnel, we expect full consultations with the Government prior to any such decision and a separate statement by it to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to indicate the Opposition's support for this important motion. The concerns that we have raised over recent days on this issue, and to which I have referred today, are consistent with our longstanding support for the peace process and with our longstanding reservations about particular aspects of it. I should also note that we welcome the Government's announcement today of a resumption of direct bilateral aid to Cambodia. We judge that the changed political situation inside Cambodia warrants such an initiative. Moreover, the human need is painfully obvious with all the infrastructure, training and humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian citizens returning to their country. We hope that Australian non-government aid agencies will play a central role in this enhanced aid program. I have seen at first hand some of the suffering and indignity of life in the refugee camps. Anything that the Government can constructively do to alleviate that human tragedy is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the motion because of the critical importance of the issues it addresses: peace in Cambodia, freedom for its citizens and stability in our region. I have referred to specific issues on which I consider that the Australian people are entitled to further information. I believe that the Prime Minister should report back to the Parliament as soon as possible on the issues where clarification is needed. I accept that security concerns may limit the dissemination of some information, but in those circumstances I believe the Government needs to take the Opposition into its confidence so that legitimate ongoing concerns can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, may I endorse wholeheartedly what the Prime Minister said about our Defence Force personnel who will serve in Cambodia. They are serving in the great tradition of our Defence Force. They have our best wishes for the success of their mission and a safe return to their families and friends. I commend the motion to the House.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In welcoming the remarks that have just been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I need to say that, obviously, while in principle the Government would be anxious to take the Opposition into its confidence on this extremely important deployment, it is the case that I have not been asked by my opposite number for any briefings on this deployment, for any information which has not been publicly available. I signal my own willingness to cooperate in that regard, but the fact is that I have not been asked for any of that so far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information on some of the points which were the subject of the Leader of the Opposition's concluding remarks&mdash;the rules of engagement, the period of deployment and the levels of commitment of other countries&mdash;is freely available. But I might add that we are talking here about an operation which is not just as simple as might be one planned on the mainland of Australia by forces entirely under our control. It is a difficult, messy and complex situation on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently spent some days touring and visiting our forces in Cambodia and I can attest to the difficulties that will be involved. The Leader of the Opposition asked about what arrangements are being made for demobilisation and cantonment and conceded that they are difficult and complex. They are. There are about 200,000 people under arms in Cambodia, under the control of five separate groups&mdash;and even more if one counts the local war lords. It would be odd, indeed, if this process were to go entirely without hitch. So I want to say to this House and to the Opposition that some of these matters&mdash;the levels of funding, the timetable for the UN's operations and so forth&mdash;are by their nature ones on which one cannot give a completely accurate picture at this time. I repeat that, for my own part and for the part of the Government, I undertake that in a commitment of this kind there will be no unwillingness to provide information to the Opposition on what is a major deployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I wholeheartedly support the Prime Minister's remarks. I first went to Cambodia in 1968, and returned there recently, almost 25 years later. For a lot of people Cambodia has entered their consciousness really only in recent times. But let us remember 1975. Let us remember the horror of the killing fields. Let us remember the genocide of Pol Pot. Let us remember the tragic legacy of the Cold War&mdash;of the decision in 1969 by the then American President to involve Cambodia. Let us remember the unforgiving struggle which brought tragedy and death to this tiny country&mdash;a tragedy which, for a time at least, attracted the sympathy of the whole world. Australia has not forgotten that tragedy. We regard ourselves as having a mission in Cambodia&mdash;a humanitarian mission to bring peace to that tragic country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that obligation is also a political obligation which arises from two sources: first, there is a moral obligation&mdash;an expression of our determination to fulfil what we see as our international duty, a duty as a good citizen of the new international community which has followed the conclusion of the Cold War. Secondly, there is a duty to our fellow Australians in the interests of Australia to contribute to security in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the first point, the international duty, it is not 14 months since this House supported the principles of common security enshrined in the United Nations charter when we agreed unanimously to the participation of Australian forces in the United Nations actions against Iraqi forces which had invaded Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again this House is called upon to commit Australia to that principle. We are a middle power; we are not in the front rank in enforcing international peace in terms of the relative number of troops that we provide to peacekeeping operations. But I can say, having visited our peacekeeping forces and having discussed recently in New York with United Nations officials, that Australia has a reputation second to none in its willingness to work in a number of ways, military and non-military, to secure peace. We have participated in the majority of United Nations peacekeeping operations since the UN process began and have contributed Australian troops to those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changing international circumstances which allowed the United Nations to take the action it did to liberate Kuwait have also allowed the building of a consensus on a peace settlement for Cambodia. The Prime Minister has dealt with this in his statement. But for the United Nations to act as a facilitator to achieve peace in any zone as troubled as Cambodia has been, the process will be complex and will be fraught with the possibility of setbacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard it is important to accept that the mechanics of managing a multinational peacekeeping force are very complicated. Let us recall that from 1978 to 1988 no new peacekeeping operations were launched by the United Nations. From 1988 to the present time 10 new peacekeeping operations have been set up without any real increase in the resources devoted to the problem by the United Nations administration. As well as simply the military question of getting the forces to the trouble spot and supporting them, the UN Organisation also faces the wider political problems of balancing the interests of countries which have provided forces and the interests of the protagonists to the conflict. Australia recognises these problems. Indeed, no country has done more to try to bring them to a resolution. But it does not make us any less committed to the need for United Nations efforts to maintain peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of regional security and Cambodia, nobody has ever claimed that this operation would be easy or risk free. But, for the first time in 20 years, this tiny country in the international community now has a chance to bring about more peace and more security. It is a chance for peace for the people inside Cambodia just as it is a chance for peace for the countries that border Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no accident that Indonesia, Australia's neighbour and partner in regional security, was co-chairman of the Paris conference on Cambodia, which played the main role in bringing the warring parties to the conference table. It is no coincidence that Thailand and Malaysia, as well as Indonesia, are part of the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia. Indeed, at this moment, Indonesia has contributed the largest number of forces. So the participation of those countries of the region is a proof, if any were needed, of the importance of peace in Cambodia for regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to speak about the tasks of our Australian troops who are there and who will be going there shortly. It will be our largest and most testing peacekeeping mission, as the United Nations moves to put the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in place. As other speakers have said, the selection of Lieutenant-General Sanderson as commander of the UN force is an honour for Australia which reflects the conviction that Australian troops will play an important role in the restoration of stability in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of an Australian contingent of 495 personnel for the UNTAC force communications unit, along with the force commander and six other headquarters staff in Cambodia&mdash;a total of 502 ADF personnel&mdash;will be by far our largest contribution to a UN peacekeeping activity. Some idea of the extent of the task can be gauged from the fact that UNTAC will be required to canton and disarm up to 200,000 soldiers; disarm another 220,000 militia; secure their weapons, which could be as many as half a million pieces; ensure the security of borders; repatriate around 350,000 refugees and provide for their resettlement; and participate in the administration of the country to provide a neutral and secure environment in which free and fair elections can take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communications unit that we will provide will have a vital role to play. I affirm that there is virtually no infrastructure or communications system available in the country outside of that provided by the 65 Australian communicators already there. Those 65 are deployed not just in Phnom Penh but in Siem Reap and Battambang and are also located forward with all the factions at their headquarters near the Thai border north of Phnom Penh in Kompong Thom, and in recent days at Sisaphon, in support of the first repatriation of refugees. They are performing a vital task in keeping all of those bodies in touch one with another and they will do that on a larger scale once the main force is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 4 1/2-month period which has elapsed while waiting for UNTAC to become operational has resulted in considerable volatility in the security situation inside Cambodia. There has been an escalation in cease-fire violations, particularly at Kompong Thom where Russell Stuart was shot. In fact, he was shot on the afternoon of the same day that I left Cambodia and in the same helicopter in which I flew around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That current fighting appears to represent a last minute push by the rival factions to increase their influence and territory before UNTAC begins its job. I do not see the fighting that has taken place as signalling that the peace process is about to break down. All parties indicated, as recently as a week ago, that they remain committed to the settlement process. The special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Akashi, and the military commander, Lieutenant General Sanderson, are in constant touch with the representatives of all factions working towards full implementation of the cease-fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay a very warm tribute&mdash;as I know the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) will&mdash;to the work which is being done by these soldiers, some of whom have already been serving in those difficult and arduous conditions, setting up the UN communications system, since November last year. They have earned the respect and admiration of all elements of the UN force in Cambodia for their dedication and efficiency, and not least, I might add, the great appreciation of the Cambodian people. I saw that for myself when I was there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present UN plan is to have the additional Australian contribution moved to Cambodia as soon as practicable, and those personnel are now undergoing training. As we have heard, the UN has set May 1993 as the target date for elections in Cambodia. We imagine that our troops will be involved for around 18 months&mdash;that is to say for six months after the 1993 elections. Delays in that process are possible. It is complex; it is difficult. The force is soon going to face the wet season, which will make movement extremely difficult, and we could be called on to stay longer than that 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition referred to the dangers which confront our personnel. We fully recognise them. UNTAC's function is a peacekeeping one and our forces are there on the basis that all parties have signed a peace accord. It is in Cambodia, indeed, with the assent of all parties. It is not tasked with enforcing the peace. But peacekeeping involves risks, and in Cambodia those include risks posed by mines&mdash;on some estimates something like three million mines&mdash;a lack of infrastructure, disease and so forth. Against that, we need to set the fact that our personnel are professionally very well trained and very well equipped. As with our soldiers with UNAMIC, they will also be armed for self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would simply like to speak to the House about the work of the Australian men and women who actually carry out the will of the Government in important peacekeeping undertakings of this sort. In far flung corners of the world, in the most inhospitable circumstances, over 100 Australian servicemen and servicewomen are right now making their contribution to international peace and security. Apart from the 65 personnel in Cambodia, we have 12 ADF officers in the Middle East serving with UNTSO; we have 13 ADF personnel in the mine clearance training program in Pakistan near the Afghanistan border&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Peshawar, as the Leader of the National Party says. We have 45 ADF communicators in the remote territory of Western Sahara on the Atlantic Coast of North Africa. We also have ADF personnel serving when required with the UN Special Commission, UNSCOM, in Iraq. Colonel John Wilson, seconded from UNTSO, is commanding the observer group in Yugoslavia. John Coates, the Chief of the General Staff, and I made a personal inspection of all of those troops only a month ago in some of the most inhospitable country that Australian peacekeepers have ever served in. While these troops do not face the same level of actual hostilities as soldiers deployed in recent wars, including Iraq, Vietnam or Korea, it should be borne in mind that the visit we made occurred just days after Israeli forces crushed through UN positions in southern Lebanon putting our forces at risk and so forth. We are very proud of the professional work that they are doing. I found everywhere I went that they were spoken of extremely highly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time has almost expired, but I wanted to make clear that we are making, as usual, provision for special conditions for our forces who are serving in Cambodia. A special Cambodia allowance of $65 a day is currently being paid in recognition of those difficult conditions. That will continue to be paid after the cease-fire at the rate $60 a day. In accordance with Cabinet's decision, the Income Tax Assessment Act will be amended. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> In further recognition of the hazards associated with the deployment and in accordance with Cabinet's decision, the Income Tax Assessment Act will be amended during this session of parliamentary sittings to exempt the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while they are on operational service. Once a formal cease-fire has been recognised, the section 79B rebate provisions will apply. Similarly, repatriation benefits will be provided which are appropriate to the tasks and hazards which will be encountered. All members will also receive normal Defence Force transfer, outlay, field and separation allowances, and rations and quarters charges have been waived for those members who will be living in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pre-embarkation leave and removal entitlements within Australia are also available to members, as are provisions to assist in defraying the loss on sale of a privately owned vehicle. As well as that, to provide relief from the conditions in Cambodia, members on a 12-month tour will be entitled to return travel&mdash;once to Australia and once to Singapore&mdash;at the Commonwealth's expense. Additional leave will also be provided as either war service leave pre cease-fire or additional recreation leave post cease-fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional cost of deployment of our 502 personnel for a period of 18 months is estimated at around $50m of which the United Nations is expected to reimburse a little over $20m. There could be some variation to these figures depending on, for example, whether the United Nations provides transport for our personnel and equipment to Cambodia or whether it asks us to transport them and obtain reimbursement. I mention here that Defence has received an additional supplementation of $20.3m as a one-time supplementation for the 1991-92 component of Australia's contribution to UNTAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by reiterating that the active contribution by Australia to the UN peacekeeping forces in Cambodia is a duty which not only serves our own security interests&mdash;not just the interests of global security&mdash;but also shows the Australian nation and the Australian Defence Force, which serves it so well, to be worthy heirs of a moral and political tradition that values the security and peace of other peoples as dearly as we value our own. This House should not forget&mdash;and I know those who will follow me in this debate will not forget&mdash;that it is ultimately our men and women in uniform to whom we look for the achievement of peace and security.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect that, in fact, three times in the last three years the Parliament has had to consider a matter of this nature. Firstly, there was the Namibia peacekeeping role and a statement given by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to the House of Representatives on 6 March 1989. It enjoyed bipartisan support. This led to a very successful Australian peacekeeping role in Namibia. I was pleased to visit that peacekeeping force and observe first hand the very difficult and excellent work that it was carrying out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second occasion was, of course, a very special sitting of the Parliament, on 21 January 1991, when the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, moved a specific motion with regard to the Gulf war and support for Australian forces serving with the UN sanctioned multinational forces in the Gulf, which led to a two-day debate which I think was one of the most moving and important debates which has ever taken place in the House of Representatives. It saw massive support for that particular effort and helped contribute to the liberation of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, 1 April 1992, I am pleased to follow the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) with regard to the peacekeeping role of UNTAC and Cambodia and to canvass the issues involved. I requested that he be granted an extension of time and, in so doing, I was particularly pleased that I gave the Minister the opportunity to detail some very important aspects which are of great interest to those who are directly involved in the armed forces. I will make sure&mdash;as no doubt the Minister will&mdash;that the information he gave on the floor of the House today with regard to repatriation and other important related matters is conveyed to those already in Cambodia and those about to go to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers of the Government and all members and senators must realise that on the outcome of this debate on the Government's parliamentary motion and the Prime Minister's speech rests the fate of many Australians and the possible loss of their lives and limbs. It is a deadly serious task; it is an important issue. We have to consider the role of our defence forces as they go about their assigned tasks. The Liberal and National parties support the Government's parliamentary motion. We have always supported in principle the commitment of Australia's defence forces to a peacekeeping role in Cambodia, as we have supported the peace process in Cambodia and the work, by and large, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and many others on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pointed out, it is quite correct that certain aspects need to be fleshed out further and certain proper criticisms and comments made to focus particularly on the exact role of our forces in Cambodia. This is a must for this Parliament before this imprimatur is given today. Having been to Cambodia in January this year, I feel strongly about the tragedy which has befallen the Cambodian people. I know my colleagues the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), amongst others, have also made the effort to go to Cambodia over the years and see first hand the extent of the agony which has befallen these wonderful people in their beautiful country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be useful if I briefly paint the picture of the scene in Cambodia circa 1992. On the one hand, we have a bustling Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia on the Mekong River, emerging from a deep sleep. On the other hand we have up country areas, which are still very isolated, which are still untouched by any form of major economic development, and which are still on a war footing to all intents and purposes. We have a bevy of expatriates and diplomats now swarming into Phnom Penh and occupying the Cambodiana Hotel, the leading hotel in Cambodia. The Singaporeans were smart enough to put it in place in time for all this effort. It is booked out. It contains several embassies on each floor and there is a waiting list every night for rooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the non-government officers, the NGOs, is gradually being squeezed off the map as part of this inevitable process. I take this opportunity to salute the work of the non-government officers who, for many years throughout the 1980s, carried an enormous burden in providing a degree of relief, with little resources, to the people of Cambodia who had been battered and belted by the Khmer Rouge and by the Pol Pot regime in the second half of the 1970s. Many are still there carrying on with their work with little focus upon them. I take this opportunity to salute all of those non-government officers, including many Australians, many Italians, and others, who carried that burden under great pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the transport front, there is an operational airport of reasonable standard at Phnom Penh. There are some other operational airports such as at Siem Reap where we landed near Angkor Watt. There is a road and rail infrastructure which, in many cases, is almost beyond repair. I think I was the first foreigner in 15 years to be given special permission to catch a train out of Phnom Penh in January so that I could see first hand the state of disrepair of that rail system. Many bridges have been blown and many bridges have been washed out by the huge floods last year. Australia is assisting in that right now with a bailey bridge project and other related projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are food shortages; there is an increasing level of corruption, as inevitably arises; and there are other problems associated with life in Cambodia in 1992. I guess the impression one brings back from the Cambodians is that they are just so damned happy to be alive in 1992, with a faint hope that they might just break through to a genuine and lasting peace and a degree of prosperity after the long night ushered in in 1975 with the Khmer Rouge and the Pol Pot regime, and all the ups and downs since that time. In looking at Cambodia I have to say that Australia and the region has a legitimate interest in helping this peace process along. As I indicated at the outset, we support the parliamentary motion on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a group of people who could justifiably be permanently embittered by life's experience, it is the people of Cambodia. One really does note that they are touched by their acceptance of all their difficulties, and yet they have a determination to get on and improve their lot. I salute that. Injustice by our standards has an entirely different meaning in Cambodia, and an entirely different perspective in many ways. This is a truly historic commitment, both in the size of the United Nations force and the Australian contribution, and in the size of the challenging task ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been discussion between the Government and the Opposition about the nature of the task and a clarification that our force is not going to have a peace-fighting role in going into head to head battle with the Khmer Rouge; it will have a peacekeeping role. It was interesting to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) respond on that particular point in his statement today. Obviously I feel very strongly about this issue, just as I feel an immediate unease about the commitment of Australian troops to Indo-China because of the level of danger that they face. It is a difficult area on which to make an objective assessment, and I certainly hope that the situation does not deteriorate and it does allow for the peace process to go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted particularly the Prime Minister's statement that Australian forces will not be participating in the UN operation in order to enforce or impose peace in Cambodia. Let us hope that that remains the case in practicality because things can happen very quickly as circumstances unfold in Cambodia. There are difficult communications and the like. This position needs to be made very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also noted the Prime Minister's assurance that if the Government concludes that there is no longer a peace to keep in Cambodia, the Australian and other UN forces will have to be withdrawn. I must say that if the Government had taken the coalition more closely into its confidence, particularly in regard to these assurances, perhaps there would have been a different perspective on the debate during the last week, but there would have been a proper debate as we wanted to insist that the Government came back to this Parliament with a statement before this UNTAC commitment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of work has gone into preparing the ground in Cambodia for the possibility of this large Australian contingent. I take this opportunity to commend especially the members of the Australian mission in Phnom Penh, including the head of the mission, Mr John Holloway, the deputy head of the mission, Mr Nick Warner, Colonel Ernie Chamberlain and many others who were a very dedicated and hard working team who could respond to any situation suddenly arising, and extremely efficiently at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister does associate himself with those remarks because it is a particularly efficient, effective and small mission operating on scarce resources. I also salute the work of Colonel Russell Stuart and the UNIMEC forces. They had 45 members, but they are now building up to 60 or 65 and beyond. They had to forge their way ahead and have done very well. I wish General Sanderson well and congratulate him on his appointment as UN Military Commander of UNTAC in a separate role. I also wish well the six officers who are going to be attached to his headquarter element.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish well the 10 members of the Australian Federal Police who are now going and the electoral officer who, if my memory serves me right, might have had experience in Namibia and is now going to Cambodia to assist with the elections when they take place. An Australian, Mr Brian Murtagh, has a particular role in facilitating the relocation of returnees and refugees from camps in Thailand and elsewhere back to Cambodia and into some villages which have been rebuilt from prefabs. There are a whole lot of complex arrangements associated with that difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warn that this will probably have some impact on the political process because we are going to create some pressures between the returnees&mdash;those who cleared out and are now coming back in as part of the peace process and the build-up to the elections&mdash;and those who slogged it out in the country for one reason or another, for all the difficulties of the last 15 years. There are going to be continuing tensions. I am sure our Australians in Cambodia are very much aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, this Parliament must never forget that when troops are deployed overseas, there are families and loved ones left behind. The troops' task is a dangerous one, and Defence Force spouses, loved ones and of course their children are always mindful of the possibility of a commitment to serve overseas in war or in peacekeeping roles and even in related roles, such as with diplomatic missions, in very dangerous circumstances. Families experience great stress in these circumstances. Spouses feel great loneliness and isolation, and the impact on children can in some ways be permanent. I simply say to those families, to the next of kin, to the children, that I am very mindful of that as an ex-Vietnam veteran. Our thoughts are with them as well for their related role in supporting their spouses who are participating in this force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will be sensitive to these issues, the proper entitlements, the proper repatriation and other arrangements, as he detailed. There is a genuine desire on both sides of the House to ensure that those who go to Cambodia are treated with the greatest understanding and are given recognition and support from a Parliament which sent them on this important mission. Parliament should not forget that it has made that decision in conjunction with the Government of the day, given its imprimatur and therefore has responsibilities, as the Government of the day has responsibilities, arising from that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me say that there is a narrow window of opportunity for the Cambodian peace process to succeed. Cambodia has arrived at that window of opportunity, but the real danger is that the world will move rapidly on if, for one reason or another, one of the key factions involved decides to scuttle the peace process, turn up the hostilities and so jeopardise the placement of the UNTAC force and the procedures building towards elections scheduled for 1993 in Cambodia. I hope that all of the Cambodians involved seize this opportunity. I warn them that if they do not, the world will indeed move on and the dark night will return to Cambodia. But that is not the wish of anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the National Party I support the motion, and indeed the coalition supports the motion. We wish our troops who are participating in this UNTAC force well, and to all Australians who are already in Cambodia we say that we hope peace will obtain, that the elections will take place in reasonable conditions and that Cambodia will rejoin the ranks of nations respected around the world and, as a nation in our region, be a nation of great interest to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to support the Australian initiative in this very important matter of the future of Cambodia. I also wish to thank many people who have been involved in the process of bringing us to this particular point. I had a close association with Cambodia for a number of years. It was brought to a head in 1987 when I visited it as Chairman of the Immigration Committee because of the threat at that time of the closure of Khao-I-Dang refugee camp in Thailand. This created a crisis for Australia and its refugee program as well as a crisis for the people there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had the opportunity, in addition to visiting Khao-I-Dang, to visit the other refugee camps, including Site 2. The full tragedy of the Cambodian crisis became apparent very much with that visit to Site 2, which was one of the worst refugee camps in the world, I believe, in terms of the way in which people were living and the extremely poor circumstances. Of course, unlike Khao-I-Dang, that particular refugee camp was not recognised as a UNHCR camp. As a result of that, people could not, except in very exceptional circumstances, be taken out of that camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention was that the people remain there until such time as a solution was found to the Cambodian crisis and then return to Cambodia. That was all very well, but what we were told of when we went there was the agony of waiting for this solution to the crisis. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are children who were born in those camps and are now 10, 11 and 12 years old, and have seen nothing else but those camps. They are now in a situation in which they are finally able to return to what we hope will be a free, democratic and united Cambodia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those involved in bringing about this result ought to be congratulated, including in particular, as has been mentioned, Senator Gareth Evans and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one thinks of the enormity of the task that is involved in repatriating an estimated 360,000 people back into Cambodia, one realises that will be one of the most enormous repatriation efforts of recent times. This is in a country that is still in a very serious conflict situation between the various factions. The task that the United Nations faces is enormous. I think Australia has certainly gained enormously in its international standing for the up-front role which it played not only in helping to bring about a solution but in actually coming forward and saying, `Australia is prepared to commit money and forces to the United Nations for the achievement of this goal'. It is a very worthy goal because, if there has ever been an historic opportunity for the people of Cambodia to grasp, it is this moment with this particular goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said that the people of Cambodia have suffered dramatically from tragedy over the last 20 years. Most of that tragedy was created by the interference in the affairs of Cambodia by a number of governments and powers. As I said in the report I wrote after my visit to the refugee camp, Cambodia has been the victim of big power interplay in that part of Asia for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time I wrote my report in 1987, the people of Cambodia were still trapped in that big power interplay. We had the interests of the Soviet Union, as it then was, the interests of China, the interests of the United States, the interests of Western powers generally, all in conflict with each other, and the people who were paying the price were the people of Cambodia. We seem to have forgotten about that. Some people in recent times have been harking back, saying, `A few problems have been created in the world now that we have had the end of the Cold War'. They forget that during the Cold War there were certain nations and certain peoples that were paying a very big price for the Cold War, and Cambodia was one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cambodia has been invaded by both sides or by representatives from both sides. It has had governments that have been elected or toppled by the three main super powers in the region. Pol Pot was the representative of the Chinese interests. The government that came in afterwards, ostensibly from Vietnam, had a lot of links with the then Soviet interests. Prior to that, the previous government was very much linked with American interests. So there was a big power interplay interfering&mdash;that is the correct term&mdash;in the internal affairs of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we have heard a lot about the dreadful Pol Pot regime, I think it is true also that during the period of that regime, until near the end at least, there was a lot of quiescence on the part of some countries&mdash;including a number of Western countries&mdash;as to what was happening in Cambodia. There was not enough discussion or protest about the killing fields. So this is an appropriate time to engage in a bit of self-criticism and a bit of reflection about what we have done in terms of the people of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just us. As I have mentioned, all of the main superpowers have been involved in an attempt to divide and separate a people who, essentially, are a wonderful people. The people of Cambodia have a very rich culture, as we know because they have brought this culture to Australia. They have contributed very much to Australia's multicultural society. When one goes to a Cambodian function in Australia and looks at those wonderful people and their culture, one wonders how this dreadful division could have happened&mdash;the awful separation which has resulted in this ongoing struggle and conflict of war. But the reality is that it has happened because of big power intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in 1987&mdash;which was a pessimistic time&mdash;that the initiatives of the former Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, should be pursued. Mr Hayden began this process and he was determined to bring the various factions together. I think it is important that we have managed to achieve that result. It is true that it may not stick; it is true that there may be problems on the way. But we really have to make a maximum effort&mdash;and I do not mean just Australia; I mean the international community and the United Nations&mdash;finally to assist the people of Cambodia to achieve that result: to shake off the yoke of the past and achieve a peace amongst themselves as one nation and as one people going forward to a free and democratic election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it can happen. I am not pessimistic, but I am not unrealistic either. I take on board the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he said that we should not be excessively optimistic. But I am not pessimistic. One of the reasons why I believe we have a right not to be too pessimistic is the fact that we have ended much of the Cold War. Some of the factors which were at play in the intervention in Cambodia are no longer present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a different situation entirely in the former Soviet Union. We now have a Vietnam which is much more ready to negotiate and enter into discussion with the West. Indeed, it is even having discussions now with the United States. We should grab that opportunity and, hopefully, move forward to achieve a government that will be representative of the various groupings in Cambodia on the basis of the support they have from the Cambodian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we actually have the patience to show the Cambodian people that they are able to have democratic rights, because for such a long time they did not believe that it was possible. They did not believe that anyone had their interests at heart. They suspected their neighbours. If one looks at the history of Cambodia, one will see that even before the big power situation there was always a jealous rivalry between Thailand and Vietnam as to who would invade or take control of the Cambodian people. In fact, if one looks at recent events one sees some of that rivalry rising again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should tell all of the immediate neighbours of Cambodia to leave the people of Cambodia alone: let them have their nation, let them have their right to self-determination and let there not be excessive intervention. That is why it is important that the United Nations and the overall international community be present, but not the interests of the immediate powers or the interests of the big powers to engage in a power play as existed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repatriation of these people will be a very difficult process. For one thing, I am reliably told that there are many explosive mines all over Cambodia. Many people, after returning to their homes or to the places they have been given to live in, will be working in the fields one day and suddenly&mdash;bang!&mdash;there will be a big explosion. Thousands and thousands of explosives have been put down by the various forces who have come into Cambodia over the years. So one of the most urgent tasks will be to find these mines and explosives and get rid of them so that the people will be able to live something approximating a normal life. Anyone who has seen the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Killing Fields</EMPHASIS> will know of the horror of the Pol Pot regime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This debate is about the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Australian involvement in the peacekeeping force in Cambodia. This is a matter of very great significance to the Parliament and one to which I think we all ought to give a good deal of thought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) have both said, we support the Prime Minister's statement and the motion. However, we support the statement in so far as it addresses the issues that we think the Government ought rightly to address. In many respects, the statement by the Prime Minister raises more questions than it answers. It is a statement which comes five months too late&mdash;five months after the Government first indicated that it would make a statement. As I have suggested, it is a statement which is somewhat incomplete, and I will come back to that point in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House, and I think all people in Australia, welcome the agreement that was reached in Paris on 23 October between all parties to the Cambodian dispute. That agreement, without any doubt, has offered hope to a devastated country, a country which, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) quite rightly said, has been devastated by a range of international events over many years. We on this side of the House can proudly say that we have never given any comfort or succour to the Khmer Rouge which is, without doubt, the most genocidal political movement that has ever taken power in any country since the end of the Second World War; on a proportional basis, arguably the most genocidal government that has been in power at any time in any country in this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1960s, one of the arguments that was often heard from conservatives&mdash;the Liberals&mdash;in Australia was an argument about concern should parties such as the Khmer Rouge come to power in Indo-China. To a very great extent, our concerns were vindicated&mdash;and we take no comfort from this&mdash;by the behaviour of the Khmer Rouge once it did come to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might like to reflect on the fact that Jim Cairns, as the Deputy Prime Minister of this country and Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, described the Khmer Rouge at one stage as `agrarian Democrats'. A former Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Whitlam, wrote in 1979 in an article in relation to claims that the Khmer Rouge was responsible for genocide in that country:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make bold to doubt all the stories that appear in the newspapers about the treatment of people in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Whitlam went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sufficiently hardened to believe that the last refuge of the patriot in Australia is to blast the regimes in post-war Indochina.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the sort of statement that one would have ever heard from this side of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals that were agreed to on 23 October in Paris were extremely ambitious; the most ambitious task, I suggest, that the United Nations has ever undertaken. For those who are extremely cynical about President Bush's speeches on the new world order following the United Nations resolutions on the Gulf war, their cynicism should be somewhat dispelled by the fact that subsequent to that new world order&mdash;as President Bush described it&mdash;the United Nations was able to formulate this agreement and undertake a range of responsibilities, which, I have to say, are very ambitious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth our while reflecting on the fact that the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC as it will increasingly become known, has a range of responsibilities which include disarming and demobilising the various factional armies: the Khmer Rouge, which is the most powerful of the armies militarily; the Vietnamese installed Government; the Sihanouk loyalists; and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. All of their armies are to be disarmed and demobilised, as the Prime Minister said, to the extent of 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second function of UNTAC is the repatriation of 370,000 refugees by the time the elections are due to take place in Cambodia this time next year. That is a massive task. UNTAC will also have the responsibility of controlling the cease-fire, of verifying the withdrawal of foreign forces, of organising the elections by April 1993; and it will also have the enormous role of trying to neutralise the political environment by taking control of five key areas of administration in Cambodia: foreign affairs, defence, internal security, information, and finance. As I said earlier, these roles being undertaken by the United Nations are unprecedented in the history of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elections that have been foreshadowed in the Paris agreement are due around April next year, as I mentioned. But at this stage we do not know when the structure for those elections will be put in place. We do not know how they will be conducted or precisely who will be responsible for the range of tasks that UNTAC has set itself. In the Prime Minister's statement, he gives no answers to those questions, presumably because the Australian Government does not know what the answers to those questions are, largely because many of those questions have, simply, yet to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four questions that I think fundamentally need to be answered by the Government in order to give greater comfort to Australians about the likely success of our participation in UNTAC&mdash;the success of the expedition by 495 Australian troops and, ultimately, the successful outcome of the Paris peace process. I hope that the Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, will come back to this House soon and provide answers to these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there is a question as to whether the current timetable, culminating with elections due in April 1993, can actually be met. Already there have been substantial delays in establishing UNTAC, and it was generally envisaged that the peacekeeping force would be in place well and truly by now, the beginning of April 1992. Yet, that process has barely begun. The timetable is a very significant factor. If it is not met, not only will the costs of this exercise blow out&mdash;and that is perhaps, one could say, merely a financial consideration&mdash;but also, more seriously, the prospects of maintaining a secure peace in Cambodia will begin to diminish because the longer the United Nations process is delayed, the longer a vacuum will remain in Cambodia and the greater the likelihood that the peace process will break down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These delays have brought us right up to the monsoon season, which will begin at the end of April or in early May and last right through until September. It is a bold person who believes that the 370,000 refugees can be repatriated between now and this time next year, when the process of repatriation has barely started. Yet, they have to be fully repatriated for the democratic process to take its course in Cambodia in April next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises very real questions, too, as to whether it will be possible to disarm&mdash;completely or by a degree of 70 per cent&mdash;the four Cambodian factions, again, by some period much closer to now than April next year. There are many signs of ugly incidents taking place in Cambodia today. I do not think it would do the cause of peace in Cambodia any good to exaggerate those incidents, but the fact is that they underline the need for the timetable to be met as expeditiously as possible and the difficulties that we face in ensuring that it is met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question that the Government has not addressed in its statement is the nature of government in Cambodia. I mentioned earlier the great task that the United Nations was going to undertake in administering Cambodia in five different areas some time over the next 12-month period. But the fact is that the United Nations has not even started the planning process for that interim administration. We do not know who will be involved in it, when it will be established or how it will work. Given that the United Nations has not even started the planning process, I must say that raises very real questions as to whether the April 1993 deadline can be met for the elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third concern that I certainly have is that the commitments of troops to carry out the functions of UNTAC are, at this stage, very fuzzy. It is said in the Prime Minister's statement that the objective of UNTAC is to have 15,000 troops. We know that Australia is committing 495, New Zealand 40, Indonesia 800, Malaysia 800, and I believe that France has some troops already on the ground in Cambodia. In total, there are indications of some 4,000 troops being committed to Cambodia, but we have absolutely no idea at all where the other 11,000 troops are coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the Prime Minister would say something about that in the statement. After all, 52 invitations have been issued to countries around the world to send troops to fulfil the obligations of UNTAC, and so far we certainly do not know where the bulk of those troops will come from. Given that we are making this up-front commitment right away, I think it would be useful for the Prime Minister to come back to the House as soon as possible and tell us where the other commitments from other countries will come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth concern which was not addressed in the Prime Minister's statement is the question of money. It is said that something like $1.9 billion will be required in order to finance the UNTAC exercise. So far we know that $35m has been committed, and no more than that. So these are four questions that simply have not been addressed in the Prime Minister's statement. I believe they have not been addressed because the Government does not have any idea what the answers to those questions are. As soon as the Government can establish the answers to those questions, the Prime Minister should come back into the House and make an appropriate statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the priorities for the Government at the moment. The statement is good as far as it goes; the motion is one that we on this side of the House are very happy to support, but we need to have a great deal more information in order to be satisfied that this overall exercise in Cambodia can turn out to be successful in terms of achieving the objectives of the Paris peace conference of October last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with other members who have said in this debate that they earnestly believe that this is the one chance for Cambodia finally to achieve a peaceful government. It is a country which has been through the most horrendous of circumstances, the likes of which have not been equalled by any country certainly since the Second World War.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this matter of public importance. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went to the electorate of Wills the other day he suddenly came to believe that a tyre factory there that produces 26,000 tyres per day required a 15 per cent tariff forever to stay in business. That is the conclusion he has reached after all of the time and all of the occasions when he has said other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that there was some illogicality in that. We understand why it is: it is because the tyre industry is part of the auto industry, and the Government has come to the conclusion that the auto industry shall forever remain at that level of tariff support, as it has come to the conclusion that the textile, clothing and footwear industries will have 15 to 25 per cent tariff support even though&mdash;and I will come to this a little later&mdash;the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) does not seem to quite agree with the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that there is some small illogicality in the fact that tyres, for example, will stay forever at 15 per cent when refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, pumps, stainless steel and a myriad of other manufactured items in this country will come down to 5 per cent. One would think that there is some illogicality in the fact that, on the one hand, the fruit industry, the sugar industry and the dairy industry are being told that they will take the tariff drops on the chin, yet, on the other hand, somebody who is making tyres near and about the electorate of Wills will keep a tariff of 15 per cent and that some other manufacturers&mdash;those making thongs or T-shirts&mdash;will have an even higher rate of tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that somebody who is making bearings for compressors might have a level of protection&mdash;if protection is going to save anybody&mdash;equivalent to that given to people who are making bearings for the auto industry. One would think that that would be a logical conclusion. So how is it good for manufacturers of electric motors or fork-lift trucks to lose their protection to 5 per cent and the automotive industry to keep its protection at 15 per cent? How is it logical for people who are making air-conditioners or clothes driers or clothes hoists or cranes or light fittings or pumps to have levels of protection that are lower than those for only two industries in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pumps are a very good example. We are very good at making pumps in this country. In fact, this country has a pump manufacturing business that is one of 26 in the world with the same ownership. Our unit labour costs are the second lowest in the world in that pump manufacturing industry, and that is why that protective mechanism can come down. But I still ask: why is it logical for those industries to have levels of protection that are lower than the levels for only two industries in Australia? An exception has been made in Wills for two industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that in those industries where protection has existed for a long time, it must come down slowly. We understand that it must be predictable so that people can see what is happening. But we do not understand why protection given to 80 per cent of manufacturing should come down to 5 per cent or lower whereas that given to two industries only should stay at 15 or even up to 25 per cent. We do not find that very logical. As a proportion of total business activity in Australia, those two industries probably constitute a maximum of 3 per cent, yet the Government is saying that the 200,000 people and their managers employed in those two businesses can have special protective arrangements but all the 6 million people who are working in all the other industries in Australia cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By what stretch of genius is it good for those two industries to have those special arrangements? But even more so, by what stretch of great logic is it sensible for those two industries, the TCF industry and the auto industry, to come down from an effective protection of 250 per cent in both cases to 15 per cent in one case and to 15 to 25 per cent in the other? By what stretch of logic or genius can the Government reduce the effective tariff rate by that amount and still come up to us and say that the last 15 per cent or the last 25 per cent in those two industries only will save them? I think the Government cannot. In fact, one can only come to the conclusion that it is a fabulous feat of mathematical dyslexia on the part of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those opposite know that, as it is so illogical, it can only be done if they have another agenda, another policy, which is a policy for votes. The principle is no different from the principle that Senator Richardson ran with in the environment industry for two or three elections. He ran on the principle of votes. The result will be the same as Senator Richardson has produced; the insecurity will be the same. What will happen, of course, is that all of those industries&mdash;the agricultural industries that have had their protection coming down and some of the manufacturing industries&mdash;will be knocking on the Government's door. Some have already started to do so. They are not knocking on our door, because we are consistent. They will be knocking on the doors of those opposite saying, `Where is our protection? Why are you being inconsistent? You sold it to us on the basis that protection had to come down across the board'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want everyone in this country to know that the Government is going to take away protection from all those people engaged in 80 per cent of manufacturing but leave protection in just two chosen industries that simply happen to be occupying various trenches around the electorate of Wills. Of course that is the logic of the Labor Party. The illogicality is that previously when the Labor Party and everybody else said that protection had to come down, they were right. The illogicality is that those opposite will not do one thing for those people in those industries. They will give them, as protection has done in the past, to a false sense of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the question that was asked of the Prime Minister&mdash;which he misunderstood&mdash;earlier today was this: why is it that people in the food and beverage manufacturing industry have managed to put on 12,500 jobs during his recession whereas the most protected industry, the TCF industry, has lost exactly the same number of jobs? The reason is that obviously they are doing well; obviously they are profitable. As Brian Loton said the other day, `Profits mean jobs'. What the Government has done is put a cloud around the direction that the factual protection debate was going and it has now started a run for Canberra. Manufacturers will be running to the Government's offices, not ours. They will be running up there by the thousands demanding some more protection. The Government is selling the people of Wills a lie. It is telling them it is going to protect their jobs forever. That of course is just nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have had the confusion between the Prime Minister and Senator Button. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said&mdash;no matter what he says at the dispatch box&mdash;and said in April 1991 that `we will see protection go to 5 per cent, to see it abolished, and to see a free flow of goods as well as a free flow of funds in this country'. On 14 March 1991, when speaking on the TCF industries, he said:</PARA>

<PARA>that is, the TCF industries&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By turning its back on tariffs, Australia will be further propelled in its quest for international trade and efficiency . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection.</PARA>
<PARA>But he has not renounced it. He has renounced it there once, and then when it comes to the electorate of Wills, he has put it aside. I have got myriads of quotes by the Prime Minister on that very subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we have Senator Button, who, when asked whether he agreed that the Prime Minister's claims that the program of tariff cuts would finish when the current targets were achieved, said that these were matters for assessment when the current tariff reductions had been completed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot in 1992 make assessments about the state of the world in the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button was referring to us. He was referring to the fact that we had a set position. But the Prime Minister has said in the past four or five days that he has a set position on exactly that matter. Is Senator Button right or is the Prime Minister right?  Let us make sure that we understand exactly what the Prime Minister has said. On 30 March he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It completes the program; that is, the end points 25, 15, 5 and 0 were the completion of the program.</PARA>
<PARA>I will mention just briefly the subject of protection. The most senior businessman in this country, John Prescott, made a statement about it last week. He was asked whether Australia could survive with zero tariffs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, industry can live with zero tariffs only provided many other things happen as well and there are not clear signs that those other things are happening to the extent that would be required to sustain a zero tariff regime in my view.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are those things?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Prescott responded:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly correct. What are we going to do about this issue?  We have to understand what it causes. Protection costs consumers nearly $11 billion every year, or $650 per person; and textiles, clothing and footwear $260. Each car costs Australians $4,000 more than it needs to cost. In the end, if we get rid of that protection over time, those extra costs should be eliminated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer tax effect of protection is regressive. It falls most heavily on the least advantaged.

As I said earlier, employment in the footwear industry has halved in just two years, despite that very high protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but protection has turned out over all of this time to be a tax on exports. In 1985 it was found that it would cost farmers $9,000 a year. It is probably still costing them $6,000 or $7,000 a year. So what are we doing?  We are taxing manufacturing exports by continuing with protection. The thing to do is slowly but surely to remove it&mdash;predictably, without changing the game, without saying one minute that it is over and the next minute that we are starting up again. We have to get rid of the input taxes on manufacturing that will give manufacturers a chance to export. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the subject of this matter of public importance, the alleged failure on tariff reform by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I point out to the House that the Government has a program of reductions firmly in place to create a climate of certainty for investment&mdash;a program of continuing reduction, I remind the House, from the enormous levels of protection that applied during the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's program of reductions is allowing, and will continue to allow, industry to prosper. Much has been said on this issue during the week. On Monday the Prime Minister reminded the House of the record of this Government. He reminded the House of the tariff levels which obtained in 1983-84, the effective level of which with respect to clothing was 222 per cent, falling to 52 per cent as a result of the March 1991 program. For clothing and footwear the level was 227 per cent, falling to 50 per cent. With respect to motor vehicles it has fallen from 250 per cent to 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), as an adviser to the former Treasurer when the coalition was in government, did not decrease tariff protection but actually increased it during the then Government's term in office. We are bringing it down to 25 per cent for textiles, 15 per cent for motor cars, 5 per cent for general manufacturing and zero for developing country preferences. We announced it; we said it was the end of the section. We have also said that we will not go on to wipe out the motor vehicle industry. We will not go to zero levels by the year 2000. The Opposition is saying, `Let's have zero protection levels by the year 2000;  let's not wonder whether we might snuff out a state of the art plant that might rebuild the Australian motor vehicle industry;  let's not consider the Falcon replacement by Ford; let's just, in our ideological obsession and our blank laziness, having never touched those tariffs in the past, cheaply one-up the Government by saying zero'. We spent 10 years getting those 250 per cent levels down; the Opposition offers the cheap one-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the dismal record of the Fraser years. It was outlined very well by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in an excellent speech on 27 March. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past two years, export volume growth of manufactures has accelerated, growing by more than 20 per cent a year&mdash;the fastest rate of any country in the OECD.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in our exports to Asian markets has also been dramatic. Taken together, the ASEAN nations&mdash;Japan, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan&mdash;now take nearly 60 per cent of total Australian merchandise exports compared with 43 per cent in 1980-81. This growth is also broadly based and strengthens the prospects for continued growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March 1991 industry statement and the 1992 One Nation statement are milestones showing the progress of the Government's program. The March statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a Competitive Australia</EMPHASIS> set out a comprehensive package that `ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for industrial development'. Tariffs for general manufacturing will be reduced to 5 per cent by 1996; tariffs for TCF industries will be a maximum of 25 per cent by the year 2000; and, tariffs for motor vehicles, 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program builds on the reforms already introduced by the Labor Government that have worked to better integrate the Australian economy into the world. The success of these reforms has been reflected in the strong growth of manufactured goods to which I referred earlier. At the same time, the Government recognises that industry needs certainty in order to plan and to invest. Therefore, the Government will not be changing its program; it believes that it is already providing the environment where investment decisions will ensure the long term viability of the TCF and the motor vehicle industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will certainly not be adopting the Opposition's policies of zero tariffs by the year 2000. If the policies of the members of the Opposition were to be adopted, there would be no TCF and no motor vehicle industries in the wake of their zero tariffs. Our position is quite clear and Senator Button and the Prime Minister are in agreement. The Government has fixed the current phase to end, as I have mentioned, at 25, 15 and 5 per cent. In return, the Opposition proposes zero, zero and zero&mdash;the triple zero plan for industry destruction, the plan that will destroy TCF and the motor vehicle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point to the initiatives announced in the One Nation statement: the improved depreciation resumed for business assets; the pooled development funds; and the infrastructure bonds. Our policy, as I have pointed out, is clear and rock solid. On the Opposition side we see a history of lost opportunities and in the current period a state of confusion and conflict, illustrated no better, might I say, by a question from the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) in this House today on the price impact of tariffs on certain articles of women's clothing. The question failed to recognise the Opposition's policy of zero tariffs; it failed to recognise that this policy would destroy the Australian TCF industry in which the majority of workers, I point out, are women; and it failed to recognise, of course, that women would also be paying a GST on those items. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some interest to outbursts by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) during his explanation of the better performance of manufacturing exports in recent years. I cannot help wondering why, if this is largely, as he says, attributable to the winding back of tariff protection, we have suddenly seen a backflip. Why back away from a position which is supposedly producing such magnificent results?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also observe that manufacturing still remains, even now, only a very small part of the total economy. Of our total exports, mining and agriculture are still suffering from tariff burdens, and they are still sectors which could enormously benefit from and provide a better export performance on the basis of further reforms in tariff regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would like to note that the Minister has said that the Government has not changed its long term plans, and to make the observation that those opposite are about the only people who seem to believe that. I will come to some of the media comment on that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address three essential themes here in the 10 minutes available to me. The first is that the policy dexterity&mdash;I think it is called&mdash;of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is having a damaging effect on the credibility of the office and it is eating like a cancer at the confidence of the Australian people in their national leadership. That matter of confidence is a very important one in the context of the need to push firmly ahead in building the new national attitudes that are so vital in underpinning the rebuilding of this nation's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence is an absolutely necessary prerequisite for investment. If investment is the engine-house of economic growth and job creation, as we are so often told, it should be remembered that it is necessary to understand that investment decisions will be determined by the degree of confidence felt by investors. That will not be found in the textbooks and, although Senator Button seems to understand that, unfortunately very few opposite do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> Senator Button commented that investors are aided by a degree of certainty in terms of future plans when it comes to making investment decisions. That is a very important principle that he underlined. Given the sort of policy dexterity which we have seen in recent times, and which has surrounded the Prime Minister's commitment to, for example, a goods and services tax, mining at Coronation Hill, interest rates, exchange rate volatility and so forth, that lack of confidence has become something of a hallmark of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is that that lack of confidence <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>has now been dramatically escalated by the Prime Minister's sudden back flip on tariffs. Despite what the Minister at the table said, that is the way it is perceived. Honourable members should consider the headlines. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> had: `Keating backflip on tariffs'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>: `Tariffs: PM caught out&mdash;Keating stand same as Opposition's'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Paul turns on himself, and the nation'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Tariff wall about-face no protection for Paul'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>: `Tariffs blunder hurts Keating'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>: `Keating's past leaves him with no protection'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Mr Keating's risky politicking'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Tariff switch puts Labor on back foot'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>: `Tariffs: what are we to believe?'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>: `Keating whips up byelection fear'; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>: `Keating's sleight-of-hand on protection'&mdash;this was quoted at length by the Prime Minister himself today; and Alan Wood's `Keating's dangerous tariff trick'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that there are only a few people in this place, and certainly none outside, who really believe that there has not been a backflip. This is tragic in a nation when our time to mend our ways is ticking away. We do not have long. Our capacity to offer to our young people the sorts of chances that we took for granted is fast evaporating. After years of telling Australians that we are going backwards in the world because we have a protectionist mentality, a culture that must be broken, the Prime Minister risks plunging us into the very trap that Garnaut warned us of. He said that the danger is that Australians will think too soon that they have changed enough; that it is enough to weaken the pillars of protectionist minds and policies without bringing the great monuments of past mistakes crashing to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Predictably, the protectionist lobby was very quick to see the opening in the door and is now working overtime to undermine the reform process which has progressed largely, I add, by virtue of bipartisan support. The Prime Minister was happy enough to rely on that support when it suited him. Now he recklessly throws it away, throws it to the wind in the pursuit of a handful of votes in the Victorian heartland of protectionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically, in the end all this is probably really only a question of rhetoric. As one of the headlines I just referred to said, essentially there is no difference. The Prime Minister's past statements clearly indicate his commitment to abolish protection, and in any case there really cannot be said to be a great deal of difference between his 5 per cent general manufacturing tariff rates and our commitment to negligible tariffs. The Prime Minister's loudest cries of difference, it seems, are reserved for those areas where we are in fact closest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Wood observed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that, even as a short term political ploy, this is dishonest and deceitful&mdash;reminiscent of the words that we heard used in this place today in Question Time. Wood also observed that the Prime Minister's aims may be short term but the political consequences could well extend into the future, with a highly detrimental effect on Australia's development in the second half of the 1990s.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wood also used the words `ill-judged and contemptible efforts' to describe the Prime Minister's actions in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to my third theme for the afternoon: the potential for long term damage to our economic development and therefore future job opportunities for our young people. The immediate financial cost to consumers of protection is easily illustrated and has been done so in this House today in several rather colourful ways. Not so easily illustrated, but of greater long term importance, is the distortionary impact on investment decisions and therefore prosperity and jobs. I again refer to the article by Stutchbury, which was referred to by the Prime Minister today&mdash;although he did not refer to the headline simply because it was `Keating's sleight-of-hand on protection'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, understandably. That article by Stutchbury in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> records the cost of protection to the consumer. He says in fact that the remaining import protection costs the average Australian hundreds of dollars per year. He goes on to say that it would be cheaper to end protection and to give a direct tax funded subsidy of $20,000 to every voter in Wills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What must never be forgotten, as I mentioned a moment ago, is this other more serious long term impact of protection, which can be summarised in two essential points: firstly, it diverts labour, capital and management into activities which are less competitive than the alternatives; and, secondly, the cost is ultimately borne by the efficient export and import competing industries&mdash;the very sectors that I thought that we all understood that we must encourage and promote. It might be added that they need not involve just the removal of tariffs but also a more efficient and cooperative workplace environment, cheaper money&mdash;in other words, more sensible interest rates&mdash;a more stable investment environment and a more sensible approach to currency management&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to agriculture, which in particular has suffered badly at the hands of these distortions. In the late 1970s it was estimated that every Australian farm was paying an average burden of $11,000 as its share of the cost of protection. That has come down a little, but it remains a significant cost. The removal of that burden, plus the implementation of Fightback's reforms, which would by Treasury estimates reduce average farm costs by over $8,000, would greatly aid the rebuilding of the rural sector which is known as a very efficient export performer. The benefits would range from better export performance, increased employment, better environmental care&mdash;as farmers would be better able to tend to land and soil degradation&mdash;and, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) puts it, it would put the big D back into decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of potential benefits from the removal of distortionary subsidies, protectionist policies and the maintenance of tariffs. The Prime Minister knows it. He must know it. He has spoken about it often enough. His attempt as a Labor leader, knowing what is clearly needed to regenerate prosperity and jobs today, surely constitutes a disaster for Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that there is such a solid contingent from the National Party of Australia here this afternoon to hear this presentation. It is intended to be symbolic because we well understand on this side of the House that the show over there is falling apart. It is falling apart and the Nationals are starting to understand what the Fightback mix really holds for country people. I just remind those in the House that we on this side of the House actually represent more country people than do those opposite. We also represent more country people involved in genuine value adding industries in country areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this. Why is there this obsession with tariffs? I will tell honourable members why there is an obsession. There has been a long history, particularly within the National Party, of clouding decades of protection and support for the farm sector by continually looking at the protection walls that were built around manufacturing, pointing the finger there and saying, `Look, you get it, too'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, of course, because agriculture has been exposed to international markets and because of the levels of protection of subsidy and the rorting of the tax system that went on in agriculture for all those wasted years between 1945 and 1980&mdash;now that those things have been have wound back&mdash;these people have said, `Well, what about you'? Let us have a look at `What about you?' I repeat the statistics that were read in the chamber by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Opposition members asked me before, `Why is it that you keep pointing back to the Fraser years? Why is it that you keep referring to this?'. I will tell him why. That was when the Opposition was in government; that was when the same people and the same policies were being put forward and that is when the Opposition had its opportunity. The electorate is entitled to ask: `Well, if you got the chance, what is your credibility on this?'. Let us have a look at the Opposition's credibility. As the Minister said, the clothing, textiles and footwear tariff barrier when the Labor Party came into office was 251 per cent. That is the barrier that was in place in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Barker has said that. I agree that he has said that. I will come to him in a minute because I have a little one here for him. That tariff barrier was reduced to 50 per cent during the years when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer. Now in the motor vehicle industry, under the Button car plan, that barrier has been reduced from 250 to 36 per cent and a managed trade-off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that the Opposition never talks about. I heard the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) talking  about the contribution that agriculture and mining make to our export program and our export revenue. Of course, they have been the major contributors over time. No-one on this side of the House ever talks about the fact that tourism is now, in fact, not only labour intensive but also the nation's biggest export earner. What is the Opposition's dose for tourism? It is to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>slap 15 per cent on top for the whole game because that is a particular area&mdash;the major area&mdash;of Australia's export earnings that the Opposition is not interested in. In fact it would take a real big whip to that industry because it is not in the Opposition's perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Opposition's attitude towards a manufacturing sector that has actually got out and started to chase markets? It has produced a 32 per cent increase in manufactured exports in 12 months, but this is never mentioned&mdash;never talked about&mdash;by the Opposition. It does not even want to know about it. The fact of the matter is that the formula has been working.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition never talks about the other ingredients of the package that were involved in managing down tariffs in Australia.

What I said was: the Opposition, never at any stage, concerned itself about the pain occurring in the rest of Australia, with a massive increase in the cost of imports that came through deregulation and with a 40 per cent devaluation. All that the Opposition did was march into this chamber and complain that the Reserve Bank of Australia was not letting the dollar fall further.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have a currency floating freely in the world. Our manufacturing exporters are doing well in the world and the Opposition does not like it. Let us also have a look at the ingredients. When I raised this question of credibility and of why we had to keep comparing the Fraser years&mdash;it is not all that long ago&mdash;we looked at the key ingredients of value adding. The things that the nation had to actually do to start improving the value adding process were, first of all, in relation to skills and education. Where were we on that? The Opposition's interest in skills and education was to give farmers a tax deduction for private school fees while the rest of Australia was kicked out of school at 16 years of age&mdash;year 10. It is an absolute national disgrace that in 1983 less than 30 per cent of Australian students stayed at school until year 12. What did the Opposition ever care about it? Not one scrap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the other side of it: technology and advancement. What did the Opposition ever do to stimulate the investment in technology that took place in this country in the 1980s and what did it ever do to stimulate the capital base that we are now forcing through the economy with national superannuation? All that the Opposition did was grow a country that was absolutely dependent on foreign borrowings; a country that now has to pay $600m a month in repayments of interest and debt. Who were the major borrowers? They were the mining companies and big agribusiness. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) knows the story of big agribusiness. We had many discussions with him about the problems of the over-investment and the speculators in agribusiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go now to the honourable member for Barker in particular. I can remember the days when I was on the Prime Minister's country task force. We had many meetings with the honourable member for Barker across the table and he complained to us that Australian manufacturers were not up to the game. He said that he preferred to get his farm products out into the world as base bulk raw products. He never, at any stage, wanted to encourage value adding in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying that Government members are the ones managing the change. Can I go to the final aspect of this debate, because the honourable member for Gwydir brought it up in his contribution. It relates to the benefits that he thinks the economy will derive from the GST and the Fightback package. I regard it as a nonsense issue. Quite frankly, we are going to go through an enormous political debate in this country in the next six or eight months as the nation decides that it is not interested in whether tax is collected at the point of spending compared to the point of earning. The consumption tax is&mdash;as the Prime Minister has said many times&mdash;a tenth order issue, but the Opposition has put it at the top because it is not prepared to tell small business proprietors that it wants the whole million of them to become tax collectors for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has not told anybody that, while it is talking about cutting administrative costs, it is actually going to add this cost burden across our whole economy. The Opposition keeps wandering into this chamber talking about making us more competitive while it is proposing to load us up with a tax system that will create the work for the resource guarantees that it says it will need. The fact of the matter is that GST and Fightback have nothing to add to the competitive model of this country. The Government is making the change. We are succeeding in growing manufacturing exports.

It should never have occurred. As you may recall, Mr Chairman, I sought assistance under the Freedom of Information Act to ascertain the reasons for this. Then I made all of the information that I obtained from that Act available to the media.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise in support of the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1992-93, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1992-93 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1992-93. The three Bills are of a fairly routine nature&mdash;and I think it is probably a good thing that we have a wide-ranging debate on them&mdash;as they seek to provide Commonwealth departments with the necessary finance to continue their duties until the end of November this year, at which time the Budget for 1992-93 will have come into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of the Supply Bill (No. 1), an amount of $12.383 billion&mdash;an increase of 2.7 per cent on the previous financial year&mdash;will be provided for the routine services of government in the areas of defence; employment, education and training; health, housing and community services; veterans' affairs; social security; and the Treasury. The reasons for the increase in expenditure are: the increase in costs and prices over the past 12 months; the inclusion of expenditure which appeared in Supply Bill (No. 2) last financial year; and expenditure on programs which have commenced since the introduction of the last Supply Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill provides bridging finance to the parliamentary departments until the Budget for 1992-93 takes effect. The Supply Bill (No. 2) makes allowances for payments to the Territories and States in expenditure on capital works and services for the beginning of July until the end of November this year. This expenditure is in the order of $4,037m; that is, 17.3 per cent more than had been provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) last year. This increase of $480m is a result of initiatives not previously included in the annual Appropriation Bills. It includes the equity injections into the national rail network and the $412m for increased spending on transport infrastructure&mdash;spending that was announced in the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills will complement measures announced in the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister, which outlined the Government's economic outlook for the 1990s. It is an outlook based on the fundamental belief that it is the duty of government to take an active role in the economy so that business is provided with the necessary infrastructure to ensure profitability. The Prime Minister has shown that the Government is committed to getting the economy going again by taking measures to increase the level of private spending and to increase the level of spending on public investment projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the present economic downturn, the Government has achieved much in reforming the Australian economy by means of consultation rather than confrontation. Over 1.6 million jobs were created through this process during the 1990s. While the present levels of unemployment are unacceptable to all members of this House, an overwhelming number of these jobs still exist. Only one out of every nine jobs that this Government helped create during the 1990s has been lost during the current downturn. The gains that were made during the 1980s provide a much more solid foundation for recovery than was the case during the previous recession a decade ago. This Government has shown that an increase in economic efficiency can be combined quite successfully with the goal of a more just society. It has done this through its targeting of social security benefits to those most in need&mdash;low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the family allowance supplement by the Government in 1987 has done much to provide financial assistance to low income earners and, of course, their families. One of the proudest achievements of this Labor Government would surely be the introduction of Medicare, which introduced universal health care for all Australians regardless of their income. These achievements took place in the spirit of cooperation involving the Government, the business community and the work force, as represented by the trade union movement. This spirit of cooperation has been simplified by the accord, which was made to deliver something which no conservative government has ever been able to achieve&mdash;real wage restraint and jobs growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threats posed to the gains of the last decade by the Opposition's GST package cannot be overstated. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is the leader of the most radically extreme right wing political movement in our country's history. He has made it quite clear that he wants to lead this nation down the path of social division instead of the path of reconciliation. He has wholeheartedly embraced the Darwinist policies of Thatcher's Britain under which the weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger. In his pursuit of economic rationalism he would dismantle both Medicare and the social welfare system. This would leave many Australians in the situation of being unable to secure adequate finances on which to live or to ensure that the receipt of adequate medical care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the application of the Hewson model to Australia, the coalition would seek to destroy one of this nation's enduring institutions&mdash;the industrial relations system. Instead of trying to work through the present system to increase the flexibility in the bargaining process, as the Government has, the Leader of the Opposition would leave the overwhelming majority of Australian workers to the mercy of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This return to confrontationist industrial relations would set us back decades, with many of the gains in productivity which have been made in recent years through cooperation between workers and employers being lost. Should the policies on which the coalition's Fightback package are based ever be permitted in this country, it would result in a ripping apart of the social fabric, the likes of which this country has never seen. The difference in the approach of the Government and the Opposition on the issue of how to get this country back on the road to recovery could not be greater. The Prime Minister and his senior Ministers consulted with leaders representing a wide cross-section of society in the preparation of the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that the cooperation of all Australians will be required if we are to solve our economic problems. The Leader of the Opposition was quick to condemn the business leaders involved in this process, saying that the business community should not be talking to the Government. He is obviously annoyed that members of the business community are prepared to talk to the Government about the economic problems faced by Australia and are not prepared to be turned into the lackeys of the coalition. The result of this consultative process was the economic statement delivered by the Prime Minister. This document represents a blueprint for economic recovery. It grants tax relief to both small business and ordinary taxpayers, while at the same time ensuring that low income earners receive relief through an increase in the family allowance supplement, which is being paid this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reaffirms the Government's commitment to vocational education and training, continues the Government's agenda on micro-economic reform and announces significant infrastructure projects which will aid our national development.  It achieves all this without seeking to impose on the backs of the poor a 15 per cent consumption tax on the basics of everyday life. Infrastructure projects announced will promote recovery by providing the private sector with the road, rail and port networks necessary to ensure that we do not fall behind our trading partners. The program is designed to get the basic machinery of trade going again, machinery which was neglected by two generations of conservative governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projects of works on our national rail system announced by the Prime Minister will greatly benefit the people of my electorate of Oxley, and in particular should provide a boost to the railway workshops situated at Redbank and north Ipswich. The completion of the standard gauge rail network from Brisbane to Perth will result in the fulfilment of a goal which has been talked about for many generations&mdash;certainly since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The City of Ipswich has a strong historical association with the coalmining industry. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, has a keen interest in the coalmining industry, as he reminds us regularly. The various mines in the West Moreton region have made a tremendous contribution to our national income through exports to countries such as Japan. Australia's competitive advantage means that the price of our electricity should be amongst the cheapest in the world. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The State by State basis of our electricity generation industry means that Australia has not been able to fully exploit our comparative advantage in coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a national grid for electricity production as announced in the statement will result in the development of a national outlook to the supply of electricity. This should be a major boost to the economy of the Ipswich region&mdash;I have a particular interest there, of course&mdash;containing as it does not only a number of highly productive coal mines, but also one of the country's most efficient power generation stations in Swanbank power station. I think many people have heard of the Swanbank power station. Many electricity workers would remember it well from the days of the Bjelke-Petersen regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of the economy which will receive substantial relief from the measures announced in the One Nation statement is the small business sector. The measures came about as a result of the consultation process undertaken by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall)&mdash;who, being the member for Rankin, is in the electorate neighbouring mine&mdash;with the Small Business Coalition. The relief includes changes to the capital gains tax provisions to increase the exemption on goodwill realised when a small business is sold to 50 per cent, with the ceiling on the net value of businesses qualifying for this relief being doubled to $2m. The ceiling will be indexed annually from the beginning of the 1993-94 financial year, ensuring that the effects of the measure are not eroded by inflation. This change was in response to the concerns of many in the small business community that the introduction of the tax on capital gains had reduced the mobility of capital for small and medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure designed to ease the tax burden on small business contained in the Prime Minister's economic statement was the deferral of company tax payments for many small businesses. The introduction of the 12-week deferral period is recognition of the impact of the current downturn in slowing down small businesses' receipts of income and restricting their cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a welcome relief for many financially stretched small businesses, and will reduce the uncertainty of having to estimate company tax liabilities within a month of the end of the financial year. Underpinning these moves to simplify the tax system for small business people is a desire on behalf of the Federal Government to ensure that these measures are administratively uncomplicated and do not impose an expensive compliance burden on small business people. In comparison, small business would have to cope with an infinitely more complex taxation system under a Hewson government. A goods and services tax of the type proposed by the Leader of the Opposition would apply to every transaction handled by every business, including every cash receipt and every payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses would be forced to spend an increasing amount of their time and resources on coping with the administrative nightmare that would be presented to them by such a tax. Gross inefficiency would result as every small business in the country was forced to become an unpaid tax collection agent for the Federal government. Over 20 times the number of businesses presently involved in the wholesale sales tax system would be caught up in the web of a GST. The introduction of a GST would require accounting for the GST charged on sales to customers as well as that required in order to claim a rebate on GST paid out by the business on purchases of goods and supplies of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small businesses currently do not have an accounting system of the detailed type used by larger businesses. Currently their obligation as far as taxation is concerned is to lodge an income tax return once a year and to comply with the requirements for tax deductions from wages which can incorporated into the wages system with minimal difficulty. These businesses would be forced to introduce a whole range of new systems to cover the accounting requirements of a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the economic costs, the tax would also have a tremendous social cost, with small business people&mdash;who we all know spend many hours in their businesses as it is&mdash;being forced to give up their weekend leisure time in order to cope with their GST returns. Their Sundays would clearly be spent doing tax returns for the Taxation Office. The coalition policies would damage the very businesses whose performance is necessary to further stimulate our recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government's willingness to assist small business is evidenced by the decision to established pooled development funds, which will greatly improve capital availability for companies with assets of less than $30m. This move means that firms with a reasonable chance of success will now find it much easier to find the capital they need to expand, as there will be a significant tax incentive to invest in Australian businesses and Australian ideas. This decision gives me a great deal of personal satisfaction, as I have been pushing for such funds to be established for some time. It is regrettable that many ideas and inventions have been lost to this country through a lack of capital adequate for their development needs. The establishment of pooled development funds will go a long way to addressing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that this stimulation to the business sector is effective, it is necessary that the business community has an adequately trained work force. The Government has taken action to establish a national system of TAFE through its offer to the States to take full funding responsibility for the vocational education and training system. The new system will be built on the foundations of the existing TAFE system, with existing institutions undergoing a significant process of expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra $720m being provided by the Federal Government over the next three years on vocational education and training will be welcome news to the Bundamba TAFE College in my electorate of Oxley, which has done much to increase the skills level of the Ipswich work force over recent years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement that the Government will fund an extra 1,000 TAFE places next financial year at a cost of $49m will, I am sure, be likewise welcomed by the Ipswich community. The Commonwealth's proposal will provide a stable funding base for this important education sector and will allow the expansion and upgrading of the TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ipswich area is at present experiencing a significant youth unemployment problem. I know many other areas in Australia have similar difficulties. Ipswich's daily newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS>, recently launched a campaign, project 500, in conjunction with representatives of the various levels of government, including me, of course, and government departments in an attempt to address this issue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign is taking advantage of many of the existing Federal Government employment programs, such as the Australian traineeship system, Newstart, the craft apprentice training incentive and job skills programs, along with initiatives taken by the Goss Labor Government in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has continued its record of support for these labour market programs in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document. It announced a $100m package that will assist 40,000 young people and will turn around the decline in apprenticeship and traineeship numbers over the last two years. The benefits of this package for the community are twofold: firstly, it will increase employment opportunities for young people and, secondly, it will reduce the risk of a repeat of the skills shortage faced by Australian business during the dying days of the Fraser Government in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance for apprenticeships and traineeships will not only help those out of work; it will also ensure that many apprentices at risk of retrenchment during the downturn will have their jobs saved. The One Nation package increases government assistance to labour market programs by around 24 per cent over and above the 62 per cent increase from 1990-91. Labour market measures announced in the statement will directly assist over 350,000 job seekers nationwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite, of course, have their own proposals in regard to vocational education and training and labour market programs. These proposals would jeopardise training reforms achieved by the Government through separating training policy development from the provision of training services, creating duplication and barriers to policy coordination, and making recognition of the need for training for the unemployed harder to achieve. Funding for the TAFE system would be increased by only a flat $77m per year, resulting in a real reduction in TAFE funding during a Hewson government's first term in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's commitment to the dismemberment of the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training would have grave implications for cohesion in this Government policy area. One department would be replaced by three government agencies and an unknown number of private agencies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seven different categories of government and non-government bodies would be responsible for policy advice and program administration of employment, education and training responsibilities under this plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET, as it is better known, was established in 1987 in order to develop a more coordinated approach to the inter-related problems of unemployment, education and training.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative structures under the Fightback package would impose substantial administrative costs due to duplication and the loss of a coordinated approach to these interrelated problems. Instead of the present approach of constructive assistance to the unemployed, Dr Hewson would simply force people off benefits without any attempt to improve their skill level or employability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job seeking functions, at present provided free of charge, would be abolished under a coalition government, leaving the unemployed to fend for themselves in the employment market. Austrain would, by the Opposition's own admission, provide only 10,000 placements in a full year without the benefit of any on or off the job training whatsoever. Services provided by the Government to youth would also be devastated, with the CES youth access centre network being abolished. I am very pleased with the local youth access centre I have in my electorate, which has recently done a big promotion. I recognise the good work it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These draconian labour market training policies come about as a result of the free market philosophy that underpins the Fightback package. If we read between the lines of the Opposition's document, its contempt for the unemployed comes through quite clearly. It believes that the unemployed are fundamentally to blame for their inability to find work and has no comprehension of the social cost of the tragedy of unemployment. The Government, in comparison, recognises that the overwhelming majority of the unemployed are out of work because of the structural changes at present taking place in the economy, many of which the Opposition wants to introduce itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish briefly to turn to the changes in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy announced in the statement yesterday by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I am sure all members of this House were as distressed as I was to see some of the media reports recently dealing with how our Aboriginal people were being treated. The problems identified by the program are more complex than the relations between Aborigines and the police and highlights the need for a public education campaign to inform non-Aboriginal Australians of the plight of the Aboriginal people. I hope that all State governments will respond to the Minister's statement. I know that there has been bipartisan support from members of this House in addressing the problems of the Aboriginal people. I hope that all governments accept their responsibility and adopt many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

A few people are awake to what is going on in the Parliament at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that on Monday the highly regarded Ross Gittins, the economics writer in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, talking about Mr Keating said, `Rewriting history was always his forte'. Indeed, that is true. We have sat here and listened to Mr Keating rearrange history for years and years. He gets away with it a fair bit of the time but from time to time things catch up with him. What has caught up with him is the recession `we had to have', the recession that Mr Keating told us he personally engineered. It has caused a great deal of damage and hardship in our community and tremendous upset within the ranks of the Labor Party. Yesterday, Senator Walsh, the former Minister for Finance, said in the papers that what Mr Keating has been doing to the economy has been most unwise. He used a lot of terms that I think anybody would say was very strong language. He said that the sorts of things Mr Keating had done in his One Nation package had been cooked up not by the Treasury but within his own office and that the whole thing reeked of economic stupidity and political cowardice. He described certain aspects of Mr Keating's administration, particularly in regard to the Coronation Hill issue, as another sop to self-indulgent, sanctimonious spivs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the words of the former Labor Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, a member of the Labor Party in Canberra&mdash;a man who voted twice for Paul Keating to become Prime Minister of Australia at the expense of Bob Hawke. These are the sorts of things that are coming from the Government in Canberra. We have people like Ross Gittins very perceptively saying things about Mr Keating such as, `He is so desperate to stay Prime Minister, he is prepared to say anything'. That is in fact what is happening. This man who is now the Prime Minister of Australia will say anything to anybody at any time if he thinks it is going to help him get a vote further down the track. All of the things he says about the Opposition's Fightback package are another example of how he is prepared to say and do anything in order to try to win political favour in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, a number of things that the Prime Minister has said in his One Nation package are worthy of further examination. One of the things that is of great interest to me and the electorate of Gilmore, particularly the centre of the electorate at Goulburn, which came out of the One Nation package&mdash;part of which is being debated here tonight in the debate on the Supply Bills&mdash;is the funds that will be allocated to the railway improvements, which the honourable member for Oxley spoke of in his address and which other honourable members from both sides of the House have spoken of in their addresses over the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extra $465m will be allocated to upgrading the rail link between Brisbane and Perth over the next two years. Indeed, many people would say that this is a good idea; it will do a great deal of good for Australia's railway industry and for the transport industry as a whole. It shall do some good, but one has to ask: will it be as good as the Government says it will be? The Prime Minister has given us the impression that this will completely transform the rail line between Brisbane and Perth and give us a modern, efficient and reliable railway system operating around Australia and connecting the major capitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, that will not happen as a consequence of the One Nation package and the moneys that have been allocated to improving our railways. The $465m will not do the job to which the Prime Minister is alluding. For example, the section of railway that interests me is the line between Sydney and Melbourne. It is 980 kilometres in length and it will have $110m spent on it. It costs $3m to build a one kilometre section of railway line. To upgrade a kilometre of railway line costs around $1m. That tells us that about 11 per cent of the track will be upgraded, if that is all it is intended to do to the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in the area within the electorate of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) we know there will be not just upgrading, but there will be a complete realignment of the track and a new construction&mdash;I think it is around Picton&mdash;which will take out that great unnecessary loop to try to straighten up the line between Sydney and Melbourne and make the trip a lot quicker. Of course, that means that $3m a kilometre will have to be spent. A great portion of the $110m will be absorbed simply in that Picton area to fix up that loop. In order to fix up the line between Sydney and Melbourne we would have to spend between $600m and $700m&mdash;and that is just on that section alone. Of course, the $465m spread over two years will not go anywhere near fixing up the line between Sydney and Melbourne, let alone the line between Brisbane and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one compares that with what the coalition is offering in its Fightback package and if one refers to the Treasury papers which the Government presented to the Parliament in its last sitting fortnight, one will find that the coalition is offering the railway industry of Australia a net saving of $306m per annum. If we compare that with the $465m one-off payment over two years to upgrade our rail line, we see that the proposals which the coalition is putting forward will deliver $306m each year&mdash;year in, year out&mdash;for Australia's railway system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can do in the course of 1 1/2 years what this Government is proposing to do in two years; the only difference on top of that being that we will continue to do it each and every year thereafter. The savings that we will give to railway operations throughout Australia will give the industry that money each and every year to carry out whatever it feels is necessary in order to make the system more efficient. The coalition is offering a darn sight better deal for railway operations in Australia than the $465m one-off payment over two years which railway will get out of this One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have to look at the other aspect of railway operations in Australia: the operating losses. I am reliably informed that Australia's railway systems are losing $5,000m a year in operating costs. That represents $300 for every citizen in Australia&mdash;every man, woman and child. Yet does the One Nation package of the Prime Minister address this very serious problem? We are losing the entire value of the Australian wool clip down the throat of operating losses on Australia's railway systems. We have to ask: is this to be addressed by the Prime Minister in his One Nation package? The simple answer to that is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has said, `Yes, we want to have some new greenfields industrial relations agreements struck before we will go ahead and spend the $465m'. But what does a greenfields industrial relations agreement mean to a Labor Prime Minister? I can tell honourable members that it does not mean the sorts of things that most people would expect&mdash;that is, a wholesale rewriting of industrial relations, not only on the railways, but across Australia. It means that we will find a very watered down agreement struck&mdash;if it will be struck at all&mdash;with Australia's railway unions in order to try to implement this $465m to upgrade the railway line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the deadline set by the Government for the establishment of these greenfields industrial relations agreements is 1 July this year. If we look at what has been reported in the newspapers, we see that both the trade unions involved and the National Rail Freight Corporation are telling us that there is no way in the world that even a preliminary agreement can be struck before 1 July in regard to these greenfields industrial relations agreements. If they cannot strike those agreements, then, theoretically, the money will not be spent. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has threatened to reallocate the money if the agreement is not reached. Yet the unions and the National Rail Corporation are saying that the agreement cannot be struck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, the $465m that the Government is offering in its One Nation package looks like it will not be implemented simply because the deadline that has been set will not be met. The unions cannot, and will not, strike an agreement with the National Rail Corporation to ensure that that deadline is achieved and those greenfields industrial relations agreements are struck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spending of this money is also contingent upon the States accelerating the reform process of their rail operations. Mr Spyker, the Victorian Minister for Transport, has already said that he will not rationalise his rail routes and provide the sort of accelerated reform process that the Government is looking for in order to enable it to go ahead and spend the $465m. Mr Spyker, who is well known for being opposed to all types of reform in the transport system, is determined not to go ahead with those reforms. If that is the case, it is quite easy to see that with no greenfields industrial relations agreement struck by 1 July and without any proposal being put forward by the Victorian Minister for Transport to accelerate the rate of reform of his rail system, then this $465m will be nothing more than a straight-out mirage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not see the money spent. Even if the money was to be spent, we would not see the types of improvements to the national rail system that the Prime Minister has indicated will occur. We will see a fairly minor overall improvement to the national rail system which will not deliver the wholesale reform and efficiency gains that the Prime Minister has indicated in his One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now turn to the road transport industry. What did the Prime Minister's One Nation package offer the road transport industry? Road transport is a very important industry because it delivers the bulk of goods that country people use and it delivers the bulk of our export commodities to the wharves to be exported. It is the vital link which enables Australians to be provided with all of the things we need for our daily existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that if the Government were going to do something to try to help the Australian economy it would do something to help the Australian road transport industry. Yet there is nothing in the package for the road transport industry. There is no cut in fuel excise, there is no removal of sales taxes and there is no axing of payroll taxes for the road transport industry. All we get is the prospect of another tax which will be introduced towards the middle of this year. So there is nothing in it for the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, if one goes to what the coalition is offering in its Fightback package and refers to the Treasury papers that the Government uses to base its attack on the Opposition, one finds that the Treasury estimates that the coalition's Fightback package will deliver an advantage of $1,147m per annum to the road transport industry. That is a tremendous advantage in anybody's book for the road transport industry. It means that the payroll taxes, wholesale taxes and fuel excises will be cut out and that all of the GST will be refunded to the people in the road transport industry. It will mean a $40,000 to $60,000 per year saving per truck to road transport operators. That is a sizeable advantage that is being offered by the coalition in the Fightback package which cannot be matched by anything that the Government has offered in its One Nation package brought down by the Prime Minister because there is not a single, solitary bit of good news in it for road transport operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to air transport. All that the One Nation package has done is promise to negotiate to open up the air routes between Australia and New Zealand. Let us go to the Treasury papers and see how they estimate the value of the coalition's Fightback package as far as air transport is concerned. They estimate that the Australian air transport industry will benefit to the tune of $376m per annum&mdash;$376m versus zero from the Government's One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to water transport. It is very important because this is where our exports go out our front gate. The One Nation package has offered an extra $20m as a one-off payment for retiring wharfies to help fund their redundancy packages. There is not another mention in the One Nation package of our water transport industry. If we see what the Fightback package and the Treasury papers have to say about that, we see that the Fightback package put forward by the coalition offers savings to the water transport industry of $96m a year. That, of course, does not take into account our industrial relations reforms that will take place on the waterfront and within the Australian shipping industry. That will deliver about $1,000m a year in savings to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see from a very quick analysis of the benefits to our infrastructure of the two packages&mdash;Fightback versus One Nation&mdash;that Fightback, according to the Government's own Treasury papers, comes down as a complete, straight-out winner. The transport infrastructure of Australia is a big winner out of the Fightback package of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, if we look at another area of interest that I have, that is, waterfront reform, we find that, over time, the Government has been boasting in its usual modest way about the sorts of productivity gains achieved under its waterfront reform program. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said in his November statement last year that there had been a 70 per cent gain in productivity on the waterfront. Two days ago, in the Parliament during Question Time, the current Prime Minister said there had been a 50 per cent increase in productivity as a result of the Government's waterfront reform program. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation, Senator Collins, has said on a number of occasions now that productivity gains of 114 per cent have actually been achieved as a result of the Government's waterfront reform program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the boasts; let us match them up with the truth. The truth is provided to us by the Government's own Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, commonly called WIRA. It tells us the sorts of productivity gains that have been achieved. In its latest paper, it says that on the US-Australia route we have had a productivity gain of 12.9 per cent, on the Far East route a productivity gain of 14.7 per cent, and on the Europe to Australia route a productivity gain of 41.9 per cent. How do those productivity gains compare with the boasts of Senator Collins at 114 per cent, the current Prime Minister of 50 per cent and the former Prime Minister of 70 per cent?  Obviously, the news that we are getting from the Labor Party, its Prime Ministers and Ministers for shipping, is totally inflated, totally untrue and the truth can only be obtained from the Government's own Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which paints a very different picture from the one that the Government is trying to create for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at the end of the day, productivity figures on the waterfront are not the most important thing. The most important thing is the price of getting a container over the Australian waterfront. To that end, the Government has dismally failed. I refer to a letter that was written by Patrick Sleigh Shipping Agencies Pty Ltd to the National Farmers Federation in February of this year. Patrick Sleigh says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">many of the benefits that have been derived because of the waterfront reform have been lost to the industry because of Port Authorities increased costs. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is saying that there are no cost advantages to the users of the waterfront as a result of the Government's waterfront reform program. It says that the actual productivity that is being boasted about by the Government is not in line with that being boasted about by particular stevedoring terminals. In other words, it is saying that no cost advantage is being passed on to the users of the waterfront, and that productivity gains are being grossly exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the living examples of the problems that Australia faces; that is, it is not getting the truth from the Prime Minister or this Government, it is not getting a fair assessment of Australia's economic problems and it is not getting the solutions to our economic problems. A solution will only come in the form of the coalition's Fightback package which seriously addresses, for the first time, the wholesale reforms that are needed in Australia in order to make Australia competitive, productive and wealthy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

That has not ceased now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that the damage done to Australia in those postwar decades cannot be overestimated. The coalition governments of the time encouraged our manufacturing industries to be inward looking, to look only to the domestic market, to become inefficient, unable to compete with products in price or quality that the rest of the world was producing. In those postwar decades, the forward looking governments of the world were out looking for trade&mdash;producing, competing and ensuring a growing prosperity for their countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the inability of the coalition governments of the time to see that opportunity&mdash;perhaps, even though they saw it, they were slack, or because of vested interests&mdash;they failed to do anything. In those times Australia really did miss the bus. But now, through the 1980s and into the 1990s, the Government and Australians are taking up the challenges and opportunities that are presenting themselves. Australia is becoming competitive, over a large range of industries, in quality and in price, with the best the world has to offer. We are becoming an international trader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs, and they were immeasurable costs, of those ill-advised policies of those postwar decades were borne by primary industries and by the ordinary consumers of Australia&mdash;the families that had to pay the premium of that tariff protection through higher prices. The beneficiaries of the growing commitment to our low tariff policy will be those same people, who will pay less for all their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the coalition to look back at our policies now and adopt them and even go further to adopt zero tariffs, but actions speak louder than words. I think all Australians would have grave doubts as to whether the Opposition is fair dinkum. Would it have had the gumption to put those words into practice? Past experience says that it would not. Even as late as the Fraser years, tariff protection was increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the spectre of McEwen still lurks on the Opposition benches and that there is a growing protectionism movement over there, which is likely to divide honourable members opposite. The real difference in performance of Australia can be seen in the comparison of coalition and Labor government performance. For the three decades until the Labor Party took office in 1983, Australian merchandise exports, as a proportion of GDP, had failed to grow. Surely at that time, some people in the coalition Government should have had the perception to see that there was something wrong with its policy, especially as the same exports in other developed countries were increasing at a rate of 1 1/2 times that of GDP. That showed real stupidity in allowing that situation to continue, and that situation continued as a direct result of the Opposition's tariff policy at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the five years of the Fraser Government to 1983 exports rose 2 per cent per year, but in the last five years of this Government they have risen at 7 per cent per year&mdash;3 1/2 times the rate recorded by the Fraser Government. During the period of the Fraser Government, growth in total exports rose 29 per cent. In the same span of eight years under this Government, total exports have risen 70 per cent. Australian industry leaders are seeing the light and the way ahead. Those export figures reflect the growing optimism and opportunities that are there for them. The need for Australia to look to the future has never been more pressing because, under the coalition government, we wasted those years when other countries were looking ahead, and we really did stick our heads deep in the sand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation program signals a direction for all Australians. It is about rebuilding efficient transport networks, road and rail improvements that will benefit all industry, primary and manufacturing, through more efficient and cost effective carriage of goods&mdash;improvements that are 50 years overdue&mdash;which will ultimately benefit all Australians. The $1.1 billion spending on infrastructure is focused on more efficient industry and includes the development of the national standard gauge rail network from Brisbane to Perth, and a better and safer road network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also recognised the ongoing need to improve productivity, and the buying of new and modern plant and equipment has a major part to play in those increases in productivity. The changes to depreciation arrangements whereby depreciation is simplified and accelerated encourage investment in modern, efficient equipment, and the new rates of depreciation which give generous concessions for longer lived assets, in particular, will encourage investment in new equipment in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear direction of these and the other policies of the Government is forward&mdash;to a more united, undivided Australia; an Australia that stands alone and is not dependent on others, but gains its strength from its own people in a concerted way. If we compare this with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document of the Opposition, we see that there is no forward thinking in that document. There is no thought of building a better Australia and no infrastructure spending. In fact, in the land transport area, which is so important to Australia, there is a cut of $74m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy is one to divide Australians and to make the gaps wider. There is no thought of sharing in prosperity, no thought of geographical unification and no thought of Australia becoming competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a policy that wears a disguise. It purports to give benefits but hides the costs. The costs are immense. The policy is about the introduction of a new tax that Australians have not had to bear before&mdash;a 15 per cent surcharge on everything that people buy. It is a regressive, unfair tax that hits the low and middle income earners harder than the high income earners. There are plenty of examples of that. One is that a Ferrari will cost $15,000 less but the family car will cost more. On those bases the tax is grossly unfair. It will hit the staple needs of Australian families&mdash;bread, milk, meat, items that have not been taxed by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this new tax do to country Australians? It asks them to supplement, to subsidise, the people living in the cities. The Fightback package tells country people that they are going to pay more tax than their city counterparts. This occurs because of the difference in retail prices between city and country and because this goods and services tax is based on retail prices. Retail prices are already higher in the country, and the additional new tax will make those differences greater. The goods and services tax adds 15 per cent to the cost of everyday needs&mdash;milk, bread, fruit, vegetables and clothing&mdash;and when those items start at a higher price it is quite obvious that the gap between city and country prices will widen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many country areas retail prices are about 8 per cent or more higher than in metropolitan areas. With the compounding effect of the goods and services tax that price difference will be 9.2 per cent. In other words, the price differential between city and country areas will increase by 13 per cent. That is grossly unfair to country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think country people are entitled to ask the National Party, in particular, why in this document it has not asked the Leader of the Opposition for compensation for country people. Maybe it was aware of these problems and maybe it has gone along with the Liberal Party Leader because, for a short while, it thought he may give it a victory. That is rapidly changing and diminishing, and the chances of victory are now almost unnoticeable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe now the National Party will look more carefully at the document and its bad effects on country people. I repeat that it is grossly unfair to country people to make them subsidise, through higher taxes, those in the cities. If we compound that item of unfairness with the fact that lower and middle income earners are the ones who are king hit by the Fightback package, we realise the divisive nature of this policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Country electorates, of which mine is a good example, are made up of a vast majority of low and middle income earners. That group of people is going to be hit hardest by the goods and services tax. On top of that, the Opposition is going to tax country people at a higher level. In other words, the goods and services tax cut contains a double hit for the people of my electorate, and the same applies for all country electorates. Country people are entitled again to ask the National Party why it allowed the Leader of the Liberal Party to get away with this, and even more so why it supports this program that is grossly unfair and disadvantageous to country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great problem of the 1980s and the years prior to that for Australia was inflation. In the late 1980s investment was being placed in assets that people perceived, because of inflation, would produce profits. Many of those investments were not in the interests of Australia; they were unproductive, they were not in any way connected with import replacement, export generation, value adding or the means of making Australia competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has now achieved historically low inflation figures. The result of that, coupled with the low interest rates, means that the incentive to invest in those same mistakes of the 1980s is no longer present. The incentive to investors is now to invest in the real means of production&mdash;investment that will bring income into Australia; investment that will provide an early resumption to better employment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That framework has been put there by the Government for a competitive, industrious, unified Australia through the 1990s and into the next century. That framework is about forward thinking and about the future. That framework can be destroyed if Australia returns to the inflation of the 1980s, because investment will once again, in part at least, return to those assets likely to increase in value because of inflation and not into the means of production and not into the real means of making a quid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can argue about all sorts of models, but it is obvious that inflation will increase when prices increase. A 15 per cent tax cannot be put on everything without expecting an increase in inflation. It is simply not common sense to argue that this will be a one-off rise. The consumers, the people of Australia, are not suddenly going to find more money to spend; therefore, retail sales will fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot raise a new tax which will collect $40 billion per year at a cost of $23 per week for every man, woman and child and expect that sales will not fall. Sales may stay at the same level if the tax is included, but the sales that return to a business as profit will fall. Thus there will be lower profitability in business. Business people will be entitled to look to cover that increase and cover that loss of profit by increasing their profit margin to cover that fall in sales, and also to cover, of course, the not inconsiderable costs in the managing of the paperwork involved in the collection of the goods and services tax. After all, those business people will all become tax collectors and anyone who says that there will be little or no cost involved in that is really not in touch with reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those two reasons at least, there will be a continuing increase in retail prices due to the goods and services tax. Continuing inflation will follow those increases in prices as sure as night follows day. We will also have pressure for higher wages. How can we put the spending power, the real wages, of ordinary people down and not think that they will press for higher wages?  Of course they will. Once again, business profitability will be lowered;  once again, business people will be looking to cover that with higher prices;  and, once again, that will be followed by increasing inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that really is only common sense. I am sure that any businessman will tell honourable members that that will happen. Yet the Opposition denies there will be continuing inflation. That really demonstrates that the Opposition is, to a great extent, out of touch with reality. I am sure that if honourable members opposite really thought about what I am saying, they would see the truth in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that the goods and services tax puts Australia back on the inflation roundabout. It dashes the hopes of sound investment. The goods and services tax takes one almighty step backwards to where Australia was years ago. A return to high inflation robs us of the opportunities that are there for us, that Australians are grasping now and that they have been grasping and taking during the term of this Government. Increases in productivity, higher GDP and increased employment are all down the drain with the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>

Of course, the reason he takes it personally is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document is his personal credo. The dogma contained in the program cannot be criticised, because to criticise it is to criticise him. It cannot be changed in any way, because to change it is to change his policies.

That growth cannot be achieved without investment in industry. That investment in the means of production will only be maximised under a low inflation policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is divisive by its nature, particularly between country and city. Prices in country areas will rise at a greater rate than in city areas because that 15 per cent applies to the retail price. The difference in country and city prices will widen by 13 per cent. I notice that at a meeting in Coolah recently, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when asked several questions about cost differentials and disadvantages between city and country prices, said, `I don't deny that in some cases things will end up costing more in the bush than in the cities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, the general trend of the GST shows that country people, most of whom are in the low and middle income brackets, will be disadvantaged.

It really is up to the National Party to start pointing that out to the people in the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Liberal Party, and insisting that some compensation is allowed for in the Fightback program for country people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policies, when measured against this goal, indicate only that it has been prepared to take a risk for electoral purposes. Faced with impending devastation, it has put together a package with which it hopes to seduce its own disaffected heartland back to the fold. I have no doubt that it will not work and that the risks will be seen as the gamble they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one starts to examine our economy closely, it becomes apparent how much it has been allowed to slide into the depths of inactivity and despair. Perhaps one of the clearest indicators of the health of Australian industry can be seen by looking at the automotive market. Traditionally, retail sales in the automotive industry have provided a benchmark from which the overall health of the Australian economy can be judged. The fact is that if we look at the present new vehicle market, we will see that the Government's record in revitalising Australian business could not be worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to be becoming aware of the importance of the automotive industry. It announced a reduction in sales tax on motor cars from 20 to 15 per cent in what was clearly an attempt to respond to the Opposition's Fightback package, in a rather transparent way. I should make it clear why I believe it is important to focus on the automotive industry and why its health is crucial to Australia's future. Australians have come to expect, for reasons of geography, topography, climate, distances travelled, purpose of use and access to speedy service, that they should have access to locally manufactured vehicles and a national distribution network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has known of the plight of the automotive industry and dealers since it came to power. Yet after all the inquiries and reviews of the industry, it has done little to protect this vital sector of the economy. According to data released by the Paxus Corporation, the automotive industry recorded one of its worst ever years in 1991. Sales of new passenger vehicles were down to 388,269, a drop of 74,237 vehicles, or a massive 16.05 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 17 years there have been only three occasions when passenger vehicle sales have fallen below 400,000 a year, and each of those occasions occurred during the term of the Hawke-Keating Government. Figures released last week indicated that there had been a slight upturn in vehicle sales, and this is to be welcomed. What is not so promising is that customers seem to be showing an increasing preference for foreign cars. According to the figures, again released by Paxus, 13 of 18 local Australian models had sales slumps, including the Ford Laser, which fell by 39 per cent, and the Toyota Corolla, which fell by 37 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that the rise in prices of locally produced cars continues to exceed the CPI. On 13 February 1992 the Automotive Industry Authority released figures which indicated that for the 12 months ended December 1991, the increase in recommended retail prices of local cars was 4.5 per cent&mdash;well over an aggregate consumer price index increase of 1.5 per cent. In contrast, recommended retail prices of imported cars increased by only 2.6 per cent in the 12 months to December 1991. Once again, imported cars have gained a further competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the Government's handling of the economy is threatening both the profitably of Australia's automotive manufacturers and importers, and the thousands of jobs that those companies provide for ordinary Australians, we should not forget the profound impact that the downturn in sales is having on Australia's automobile dealers, their operations and the people they employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, Nissan has decided it can no longer continue to manufacture cars in Australia and has announced it will be closing its manufacturing operations. Jobs will be lost, not just in the manufacturing plant, but in the downstream areas of dealerships, repairs and servicing, and in the upstream areas of parts and component manufacturing and supply. As well, in the weeks since the closure, Nissan has taken the opportunity to embark on a major but yet unannounced program of rationalisation of its dealer franchise network. This has only served to aggravate and deepen the damage already done to Australia's economy by its decision to quit manufacturing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that already between 60 and 100 dealerships have been abandoned by Nissan without compensation of any kind. It is likely that this may result in as many as 2,000 to 3,000 more employees, who have given dedicated and loyal service to the car maker, finding themselves out of work. I fear that there are still more to follow in what is one of the most savage reductions in a company's commitment to the Australian market ever seen here. Given these unfortunate consequences, I believe that there would be considerable merit in the Government extending to automotive retail workers who are retrenched the compensation and retraining benefits available to workers involved in car manufacturing under the Button car plan. Such an extension into the retail areas of the automotive industry would recognise it is also undergoing serious structural change as all local manufacturers savagely react to the losses they have incurred as a result of the recession caused by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nissan episode is, however, only a part of the sorry current situation in this vital trade. According to figures which I have obtained from the Motor Trades Association of Australia, in 1984 when this Government had only recently come to power, there were 2,650 new vehicle franchise dealers operating approximately 4,000 franchises and employing over 68,000 Australians. By July 1991, after eight years of this Government, there were only 1,540 new vehicle franchise dealers in Australia, or at least 1,000 fewer dealers than in 1984. Those dealers now operate 2,754 franchises. Employment in the surviving dealerships has dropped remarkably since 1984 from 68,000 to only 40,000&mdash;a net drop of over 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is even worse in rural Australia. Here we can find even starker evidence of the recession that Australia is enduring. In 1984 there were 2,400 farm machinery dealers in Australia. In 1991 there were 900, with a loss of about 16,500 jobs from country towns during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the recession has had a marked impact on the automotive industry generally. I mentioned what Nissan has embarked upon since it closed its manufacturing operation. But it is a matter of national concern that a number of manufacturers and importers in Australia are taking advantage of the economic downturn to rationalise their operations at the expense of the very dealers they have franchised and, as a consequence, those employed by their dealers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 November 1991, I drew attention to the plight of a number of new franchised motor vehicle dealers in Australia who have been subjected to unconscionable conduct by their suppliers. I drew attention to the action which Toyota had taken against the Ken Morgan group of companies in forcing Mr Morgan to sign a contract under economic duress that effectively led to the receivers being brought in and to the subsequent collapse of his dealership network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, in May 1990, in your capacity as the honourable member for Stirling, you raised the actions by Honda Australia Pty Ltd in terminating the franchise agreement of three major motor vehicle dealers in metropolitan Perth. These dealers were given an undertaking by Honda Australia that if they upgraded their premises to a certain standard their franchise agreements would continue into the future. The dealers spent the money on plant, development and site presentation; nevertheless Honda unilaterally and precipitately decided to terminate those agreements. I understand that at the time there was concern that at least one of those franchises had been taken up by the Otsuka family of Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then I have been advised by Honda Australia that it has not forced any dealers in Western Australia to sell their businesses to Honda Australia or any Japanese firm, and that the Otsuka family has not at any time in the past, nor at the present, owned a Honda franchise in Australia. That may well be so. However, it does not alter the fact that the action which Honda took against two dealers in Western Australia to terminate their franchise agreements was ill-judged and did considerable harm to franchisor and franchisee relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be acknowledged that, after intervention by the Motor Trades Association of Australia in the matter, the executive director was able to write to Honda acknowledging that the difficulties had been settled cooperatively to the satisfaction of their members. It shows what can be achieved when manufacturers and dealers talk to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at a time when one would expect manufacturers to be trying, above all else, to build better relations with their franchised dealers to bring about stability and recovery in the marketplace, the action taken by Honda was not an isolated case. Toyota and Mitsubishi also took action against a Northern Territory dealer last year and terminated his agreement without any fair settlement. This action was repeated in Toyota's action against two major dealers in Victoria whose businesses would have remained viable but for the manufacturer's action. In addition, last year Daihatsu also terminated its agreement with a Queensland dealer and took similar action against a dealer in Tasmania. In South Australia, I understand that Alfa Romeo Australia Pty Ltd has recently decided to terminate its franchise agreement with a prominent industry dealer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going to individual cases, all of these actions illustrate the problems which franchisees face in regard to the tenure of their franchises and their basic rights as franchisees to make a fair and reasonable return on their capital and labour. Unless dealers have the right to retain sovereignty in their businesses and the right not to be subjected to unconscionable and precipitate action by their suppliers, then the long term health of those vital Australian businesses will  be at risk and so will the jobs of the thousands of young Australians they employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must make clear to honourable members that this is an issue that the Government cannot ignore. It is in fact an issue that, as recently as 6 February, the small business coalition placed before the Government as part of a 20 point agenda of issues which set out those matters which small business feels are inhibiting its capacity to grow and therefore to employ. Among these issues is the need to develop a code of practice to govern franchisor and franchisee relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an issue with which the Government is unfamiliar. It is central to the issues considered by the present Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) when he previously chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology during the period when it conducted its inquiry into small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Small Business has since appointed a national task force on franchising to investigate a wide range of issues relevant to franchising and which recommended the establishment of a self-regulatory code of practice to be administered and maintained by a council of representatives from all areas of the franchising sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its meeting with the Prime Minister, the small business coalition asked the Government to support this measure and to seek the support of all State governments, trade and business associations and all franchised businesses for the introduction of a voluntary code to be supported where necessary by sanctions applied by all parties against those attempting to circumvent it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday 13 March, the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for small business met and issued a communique which broadly agreed to support the recommendations of the franchising task force report by agreeing to a trial self-regulatory code for the franchising industry. I understand that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs will be taking the matter to Cabinet shortly. Frankly, it is not before time. The sooner that is done the better. At long last there will be some action in this area. I for one will be attempting to remind the Minister that action is now due and no slippage is excusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, as part of its Fightback package, has acknowledged that a voluntary code for franchising must be introduced as soon as possible. The Opposition's spokesman on small business, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), has committed the Opposition to introducing and facilitating these measures. It is a commitment to be applauded. It must be emphasised that the guarantee and protection of rights in the automotive industry can never be merely a government responsibility. It is up to the major car manufacturers and importers to ensure that a range of franchise agreements are put in place with their franchised dealers which are fair and equitable and provide mechanisms for dispute resolution. These franchise arrangements underpin the health and viability of those retail outlets which are so important to the health of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is timely, therefore, for the major motor vehicle manufacturers and importers to take a lead from developments which have occurred overseas&mdash;and in the United States, in particular, where the need for fair and equitable dealer agreements is now under close scrutiny. In 1990 the General Motors Corporation in the US recognised for the first time the plight which many dealers find themselves in. Through negotiations with the National Automobile Dealers Association in that country, it developed one of the fairest and most equitable dealer arrangements that have been developed in the world. In this regard I understand that the Australian Automobile Dealers Association&mdash;a member of the Motor Trades Association of Australia&mdash;has taken that standard dealer agreement and developed it for Australian conditions so that it may be used by dealers in future negotiations between dealers and their franchisees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, agreements will differ from company to company to suit both manufacturer and dealer interests. Nevertheless, I consider that much more could be done by the companies to listen to their dealers and to negotiate dealer agreements with them that are in their mutual interests. If the basic rights of franchisees were respected and held in high regard by the companies which supply those franchised dealers, there would be no need to raise in this place the examples of abuse of market power which some companies have undertaken in their own interests at the expense of their own dealers and the many people they employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The automotive industry and the retail motor trades generally are vital to the health of the Australian economy. The capital size of the dealer service and infrastructure, as shown by submissions by MTAA to the Industry Commission, is at least $10 billion. The parts stock alone is valued at $610m. This is an investment which ought be protected and ought not be put at risk. The Government, which has the power to address the issues that affect the capacity of small business to grow and employ, has to take steps now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its consultations with the Government prior to the release of the economic statement, the Small Business Coalition put forward a 20-point plan which, if implemented over the coming months, would significantly assist small business. There will be many small business people today examining the Government's statement to see how many of the crucial impediments to profitability and employment growth have been removed or even considered. They would hope to see that the Government seems finally to have recognised that small business is a constituency with its own special needs and its own special problems which need to be addressed if its efficiency and productivity are to be maximised and its capacity to employ strengthened. But recognition of the small business constituency has only led to a very small and partial list of the issues being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little in the statement on the capital gains tax front and some welcome relief for company tax payments. There is some additional funding for export and the provision of some minute additions to the availability of capital. But where are the other 15 or so issues that the Small Business Coalition wanted addressed? There is no response to the various economic measures proposed, many of which are also a part of the Opposition's Fightback proposals. There is silence from the Government on management training matters and the questions of regulation and competition that go to the heart of business productivity. When small business is in a position to compare the Government's lacklustre performance with the Opposition's proposals, it will become clear&mdash;starkly clear&mdash;that it is the Opposition alone which has been prepared to develop policies and make commitments which will increase the profitability of, and the opportunity to expand in, the small to medium enterprise sector, the real engine-room of growth and wealth creation in Australia. Those matters, when combined with the actions which could be taken by the captains of Australian industry who could and should be doing much more to ensure that those businesses which retail their products under franchise arrangements remain profitable and viable, are crucial to Australia's future economic well-being. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past few weeks one of the Australia's modern day medical heroes has been the subject of vilification and scorn simply because he has spoken the truth. I refer, of course, to Professor Fred Hollows, former Australian of the Year and undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and dedicated medicos this country has ever produced. I do not intend tonight to detail the many achievements of the career of Professor Hollows, nor to debate the issue of homosexuality, because neither is particularly relevant to the point I wish to make in the few minutes available during this adjournment debate. My basic concern is the unfortunate furore that erupted over comments made by Professor Hollows in relation to some aspects of the management of the current AIDS epidemic in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very significant and sensitive issue&mdash;morally, socially and politically&mdash;but that should not prevent a person from having an opinion and expressing it, even if it may be unpalatable in some quarters. For far too long in relation to AIDS far too many people have not been prepared to state the plain facts. Professor Hollows has been brave enough to do so and the community&mdash;particularly those in the HIV-AIDS high risk categories&mdash;should applaud his actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this tragic disease first reared its ugly and incurable head in Australia almost a decade ago, more than 15,000 people have been diagnosed as HIV-positive and almost 2,000 people have died of the disease&mdash;and it has not yet reached its peak. These are frightening figures, but what is more alarming is the hesitancy by many intimately involved in the AIDS education program to acknowledge that the vast majority of AIDS victims&mdash;some 95 per cent&mdash;are, whether we or they like it or not, white homosexual men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the facts of the matter. We cannot hide from them and we can not change them. Fred Hollows has not concocted these statistics&mdash;all he has done is draw our attention to them. What is wrong with that? I have not heard of anyone actually disputing the figures he has quoted; people just do not want him to quote them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His assertion that the AIDS education strategy and HIV-AIDS prevention campaign have in some respects failed to adequately or appropriately recognise or emphasise the very real dangers faced by a specific section of the community have met with a flurry of defensive&mdash;and even insulting&mdash;responses. Yet, all he is asking is that the money available for AIDS education and research be spent wisely and well and in the best interests of those suffering from or threatened by this devastating disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good professor has readily acknowledged that, in some respects, the AIDS campaign has been very effective in containing the spread of the disease, but there are other areas where improvement is needed. Fred Hollows is certainly not alone in questioning the effectiveness of some aspects of AIDS education, although he has certainly taken most of the flak over recent weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, many of those leading the attack against him are the very people he is trying to protect. If only they would stop their protesting and listen, they may learn something which in the final analysis can only be to their considerable and lasting benefit. It is not only useless and unrealistic to adopt a head-in-the-sand attitude to these matters; it is downright dangerous. The truth is the truth and, in this case, the truth can mean the difference between life and death. Professor Hollows is quite correct when he says that public health policy must rest on the grim assumption that the AIDS epidemic will be over only when the last HIV-infected person dies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Fred Hollows for having the guts to tell it as it is. He deserves not only our support but also our gratitude. As he has said, re-energising the HIV-AIDS debate in Australia has cost him a lot of time and effort but it will all have been worthwhile if it can reduce the AIDS deaths in black and white Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seventy years ago this week, my grandfather and his brother Ben bought our property, Sunnyside. As I spoke to my dad tonight&mdash;it is his seventieth birthday&mdash;it was a bit touching to reflect on the fact that we have owned our sugarcane property for 70 years. Even though I leased my farm in 1986, I still derive income from the production of sugar and tomatoes. Just as many members of this House are doctors and solicitors but do not practice because of their responsibility, I no longer actively farm and grow my cane, although I consider myself a canefarmer and am proud of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years there has been much debate in regard to the restructuring of the sugar industry in Queensland. I have certainly been the subject of criticism for supporting the abolition of the sugar embargo so that we could go to the GATT with clean hands and argue for fairer and freer trade given the fact that we export 80 per cent of our sugar overseas. When I supported the reduction of tariffs across the board, as the Government has done, I was criticised and vilified by the National Party from Brisbane to the cape. It is interesting to see the duplicity and the double standards that exist. Every member of the National Party in Canberra supports the Fightback package, as one would expect or believe. But back home in Queensland the same people go to water when they meet their farm organisations and their own branches; they become outright protectionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has criticised me continually for supporting the abolition of the sugar embargo, fighting for freer trade, and has argued against the cuts in tariffs. Yet he is married to the Fightback package and recently put out a pamphlet supporting that package. I guess he has two points of view: when comes down here, he tries to be a statesman, but when he goes back home he goes to water as a typical Queensland National Party politician, and says what people want to hear.

They do it all the time. They have no shame whatsoever. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> recently we saw the headline, `Libs pressure Mr McLachlan to justify tariff cuts'. What is really happening on the other side is that they are starting to burn.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that our tariff cuts will bring down tariffs on sugar in July 1992, relative to the fluctuations of the exchange rate and the prices overseas, between 23 and 27 per cent&mdash;and that is a conservative estimate. But under the people on the other side it will be zero within eight years. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has called for the speeding up of certain tariff cuts. I wonder what National Party members are going to say when they wander back around Queensland and face the same canefarmers that they have told we have betrayed by cutting tariffs and getting rid of the sugar embargo, when they themselves are married to zero tariffs across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we have seen the Nationals try in a very petty, dirty way to gain votes from playing on the emotions of farmers in the rural crisis. But what are they going to do to them? They are going to put on a tax of 15 per cent and then apply road user charges. They should go back to Kingaroy and tell their mates that they are going to tax them at 15 per cent on every single thing. They are going to create a crisis with their Fightback. The biggest crisis for members of the National Party is the fact that the Fitzgerald inquiry came out and put a bit of decency into Queensland. So their colleagues in the State House have now faced law and order, and four of them, as we know, went to gaol. </PARA>

We had a case not so long ago, a terrible situation, in which a homosexual was granted custody of his two children and then went to live in Western Australia with his gay lover. I objected to that.

That is what has gone wrong with the world today. The norm seems to be forgotten. People seem to think these trendy ideas and fashions of today are the norm.

For example, one person sitting up a tree at the Picton River was an unemployed musician. I made the remark, `You must be whistling up there looking for a job'. We have good people in the Geeveston area near the Picton River trying to get a job; trying to pay their way; trying to pay off their trucks, if they work in the timber industry; and trying to make a decent, respectable living, being confronted by people getting unemployment benefits who are stopping them from working.

What is concerning me are the roles of what I consider to be  pseudo-nationalism, which is aimed at bashing Britain, a country which offers no sovereign threat to Australia at all in any conceivable shape or form, and tending to pander to north-east Asia. I think it comes from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North East Asian Ascendancy</EMPHASIS> written by Ross Garnaut. It is a very, very dangerous trait and it hides the real problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in Australia with the republican movement is that it has been taken over by the multiculturalists, and multiculturalism is what is tearing the heart out of this country. An example of this is the shearers camp outside the front of Parliament House protesting against shearers from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate I have been inundated with representations from shearers complaining about this. The interesting thing is that most of them are in fact New Zealanders, and they say, `We have come to Australia. We have made a commitment to Australia. We are paying our taxes here. We can now no longer get jobs because these people, these fly-by-nighters, are coming over from New Zealand, working for a short time, paying no tax in Australia, breaking down our award conditions, and then going away'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This occurs because of the taxing arrangements that we have with New Zealand. That is something which the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) indicated today he would look into. I have faith that he will try to rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that I have had calls from and spoken to many pastoralists who say that they, too, are concerned. They say, `We were making very good progress talking to the union about shearing costs and anomalies in the award'. With the advent of the shearers from New Zealand&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>they know it is only a short term phenomenon&mdash;the whole thing has been destroyed. The rapport they have been building up has been destroyed, and they see this as destructive to the long term interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these New Zealand shearers are supported by the likes of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and all the agro-political bodies, I would say to the farmers of Australia, `Just look at what the agro-political bodies have done to you in the recent past in respect of the wool industry. They got it wrong, and their performance has been appalling'. If we are going to be a nation, we must stand up for Australians first. Shearers who are keen to work cannot now find employment, simply because they have been undercut by these people who are entering from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreements we have with New Zealand, where we basically have a common labour market, it is difficult to find a solution to this problem. But the Government must, in the final analysis, find some way of stopping this, because if we are going to build a nation in Australia it has to be a nation with industry to support it. It means we must have an intelligent industry policy. In my view, that means we are going to have to give sectoral support to some industries. The primary industries in Australia are industries which are clear winners for this country; they have a great future. In many ways they are sunrise industries. We are not going to benefit this nation if we are going to allow the sort of thing that has been happening in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about level playing fields, but the reality is that in Australia we do not play on a level playing field. We actually tilt it against ourselves. All that the shearers are asking is that we play on a level playing field. If we do, there is no problem. They are prepared to compete for their jobs, but they cannot compete unfairly. People come in with a foreign exchange advantage and they can afford to cut the rate without actually losing money themselves. They do not pay tax here, and they can go back to New Zealand and not work for the rest of the year, thereby reducing their overall rate of tax to a level where they pay either no tax or negligible tax. We simply cannot compete with that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, where we have the trauma of unemployment in country areas, very depressed country areas that are far worse than the cities, we are finding that a lot of this unemployment is directly related to the shearing industry. It is a problem that the Government cannot afford to sweep under the table. It is wrecking the very fibre of this nation. If the fibre of this nation is allowed to fray in the country areas, mark my words, it will spread to the cities. One of the great problems in Australia is that we are developing into two different nations&mdash;an urban nation and a poverty-stricken country area. The reality is that it is the country areas of this nation, through primary industry and mining, that provide all the jobs and drive the economy of the cities. We have to realise that if we are going to put this country back as a united nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Anti-Dumping Authority announced today that it had rejected an application by the Australian peanut industry for protection from peanuts being dumped in this country from the People's Republic of China. This is an extraordinary decision which demonstrates the Federal Government's total lack of commitment to the interests of Australian industry and the utter hypocrisy of the current empty rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on tariff issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Chinese peanuts, both the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Customs Service have found that dumping is occurring and that the Australian industry has been damaged, but have refused to impose anti-dumping duties. The Authority and this Government prefer to favour the interests of a handful of importers rather than support the just grievance of Australian peanut producers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the peanut product coming into this country is of poor quality, is chemically contaminated and has already done damage to the consumers' appreciation of peanut products. On top of all that, the peanuts coming to Australia from China are dumped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Peanut Marketing Board, based in Kingaroy, with the support of six independent peanut shellers, lodged an application requesting anti-dumping measures against exports of raw and blanched peanut kernels from the People's Republic of China. The industry established beyond doubt to both of the Government's reviewing authorities that the peanuts coming into Australia are being dumped. The authorities have also accepted that material injury has occurred to the Australian industry. Despite the situation meeting all the reasonable criteria for having dumping duties applied, the Government will do nothing for this significant Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABS statistics point out that since 1987 peanut imports from China have increased from 2,053 tons to 8,374 tons&mdash;a 307 per cent increase&mdash;and now represent 30.9 per cent of the Australian market. These peanuts are being brought into Australia at prices of up to $800 a ton below past domestic prices in Australia, significantly reducing returns to local peanut farmers. There have been poor seasons, making it necessary to import some peanuts to make up the shortfall in local production, but some of the importers want to institutionalise the imports to maximise their own profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These dumped imports have destroyed the confidence of the Australian peanut growers. Even now, in a better season, farmers have failed to plant their previous acreages. In the past Australian farmers consistently planted between 30,000 and 35,000 hectares. The current crop is one of the best for years but there are only 23,000 hectares. This can be directly attributed to the impact of dumped Chinese peanuts. The Executive Director of the Anti-Dumping Authority, Mr Jock McGuire, illustrated the philosophy of our Anti-Dumping Agency when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we go to a factory to assess if it is suffering material injury from imports we want to find a bit of blood on the floor. That is what we want to see.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry to report that the peanut industry qualifies under this criterion also. If Mr McGuire and his staff care to wander around the remnants of the Australian peanut industry they will find plenty of blood. The number of farms has been slashed, investment has ceased, most farms are carrying massive debt, virtually all the farm families are living below the poverty line and few have a positive cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) offers no sympathy. He defends the importers and heaps ridicule on the Australian industry, accusing it of merely trying to increase its market share. Of course the industry is trying to recapture the market share it has lost to the Chinese, and it can successfully do so with a superior product if only it is given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the National and Liberal parties will deliver a fairer trading environment for Australian industry upon return to government. We will slash the amount of time taken to determine anti-dumping and countervailing cases and change the material injury test to ensure that an industry does not have to be decimated before remedial action can be taken. If there is to be any bias in the inquiry process, it should favour the Australian industry rather than the importer. Assistance must be available to help small industries in particular to meet the massive cost of mounting effective anti-dumping action. Where there is any doubt we should favour the Australian producers. The editorial in the last edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peanut World</EMPHASIS> said it all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Make no mistake, the fight against the dumping of cheap Chinese peanuts in Australia is a fight for the survival of the Australian peanut industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make some comments with regard to the response that we have received to date from the State and Territory governments, because it is a matter of some disappointment to me that we have received such a poor response from State and Territory governments, of all political persuasions, throughout this country. It is in fact the State and Territory governments that have the primary responsibility for many of the issues that need to be addressed from the 339 recommendations contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly disappointed with the response from the Queensland Government. It is sad for me to note that the Queensland Government has indicated with respect to the initial stage its unwillingness to commit any further funds from its own resources to address some of these fundamental issues. I find that particularly sad because Queensland actually has the largest proportion of Aboriginal and Islander people living in this nation. Therefore, it probably has more of a responsibility to respond positively to the issues raised in this report than any other State or Territory government. I am particularly disappointed so far at the level of commitment that has been made by the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite alarming that in the last few weeks we have had from the Queensland Government a commitment of $19m to the loss on the Indy-car race that occurred recently at the Gold Coast and, similarly, a commitment of $10m to underwrite the refloating of Compass Airlines, yet it says that it cannot find any additional funds to provide some further resources to significantly respond to the massive disadvantages faced by Aboriginal people on the fundamental issues of health, housing, education, community resources and alcohol and substance abuse. The Queensland Government does have primary responsibility for these issues. After having lived and worked in an Aboriginal community in far north Queensland, I know only too well the level of disadvantage that is suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Queensland. I call on the Queensland Government to think again about its response, to think carefully about the level of funding that it does allocate at the moment and to very carefully consider the priorities that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that all State and Territory governments have limited financial resources and do not have buckets of money that they can throw at every issue. But this is a fundamental social justice issue, and with Queensland having the largest population of Aboriginal and Islander people, the Queensland Government does have  a fundamental and primary responsibility to respond positively to the recommendations in the report on Aboriginal deaths in custody, to match the funding that has been provided by the Federal Government on these issues, to come forward with some true, meaningful responses to this report, to put its money where its mouth is as far as social justice commitments are concerned, and to start tackling the real issues that need to be addressed as far as Aboriginal people are concerned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know a little about these sheltered workshops and have corresponded with Ministers on behalf of various businesses, including John's company. The sheltered workshops have caused me to write to the Ministers. The areas in which the sheltered workshops are causing concern are the duster industry and the industrial laundry industry. I believe it is a tremendous idea that handicapped people have the opportunity to work. I know that John Delacretaz believes the same. I happen to have spoken to him about it on many occasions. However, there have been problems  in  the  two  industries  already mentioned:  lambswool  dusters  and  industrial laundries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems arise from the fact that the sheltered workshops undercut the pricing structure of existing businesses. They are able to do this using subsidies both for labour and for raising new capital. The result is that taxes raised from enterprises such as John's are used to subsidise products that compete with his products. John's competitor, for instance, has had some millions of dollars in grants which have harmed John's business. A similar situation has occurred in industrial laundries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These subsidised workshops should be able to compete but not undercut prices, and not at the expense of established businesses such as that of John Delacretaz.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware of the Law Reform Commission's discussion paper No. 48 on Multiculturalism: Criminal Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Female genital mutilation is not expressly prohibited by law but there is little doubt that it would constitute an assault and therefore breach State and Territory criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Paragraph 3 of Article 24 of that Convention provides:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through publicity campaigns and the work of agencies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, that attitudes of the community toward practices such as female circumcision can best be changed. This of course is a lengthy process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However the Law Reform Commission, in its discussion paper, does not consider that there is a case for the enactment of special legislation to prohibit female genital mutilation as the numbers affected are likely to be very small and there is disproportionate risk that legislation would be counter productive. The Commission favours action in co-operation with the community to assess the extent of the problem and to provide educators and counselling directed to particular communities. It considers that these communities should be made aware that the practice is an offence under the general law and that those who take part may be liable to severe penalties.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1655" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FARRER">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The World Bank has advised that the construction of a mini sugar mill, with an annual output capacity of 1,000 tons of plantation white sugar, was a component of the International Development Association (IDA) assisted Agricultural Production Support Project (APSP) in Laos, for which IDA Credit 1395-LA was approved on 28 June 1983. The IDA is part of the World Bank Group. The total credit was SDR5.8 million (approximately $US6.2 million), of which $US1.51 million was allocated to the sugar mill component. The mini sugar mill was eventually installed in 1990 with an annual capacity of 2,000 tons of plantation white sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am further advised that the sugar mill had a trial run in 1990 but commercial production has not yet started, mainly due to a lack of working capital. The mill is one of many public sector enterprises in Laos which have been affected during the transition from a socialist to a market economy. Centralised planning and controls are being dismantled, and public sector enterprises are expected to exercise financial and managerial autonomy. These enterprises, including the sugar mill, are no longer financed through the Government budget. Many are unable or unwilling to borrow for their investment or working capital requirements from the emerging commercial banking system due to the prevailing interest rates of around 35 to 40 per cent and the fact that domestic banks have only limited resources. To ensure financing and efficient management of the sugar mill, the Vientiane Municipality, which controls the mill, concluded a five-year Joint Management Agreement with an Australian company Batstone Technology Pty. Ltd., which had installed the plant. Under the Agreement, concluded in September 1990, Batstone was to provide management and arrange a working capital loan. IDA was neither involved in the process of negotiations nor did it approve the Agreement. There have been conflicting interpretations and claims under the Agreement by Batstone and the Vientiane Municipality. Batstone has not yet arranged the working capital loan and mill production has not commenced. The sugar mill is now on the priority list for privatisation under the Government's privatisation program. Batstone offered to buy the mill, but the terms were not acceptable to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Credits under the IDA are provided on a disbursement basis for approved expenditures. This means that finance for the sugar mill could not be invested elsewhere by the Laotion government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The World Bank has advised that it would be contrary to its policies to provide the requested information about the officers in the project. The Bank has a collective responsibility for approved projects.</PARA>
