<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the moving pictures inquiry was launched 18 months ago, the Committee distributed a poster which read: `How do you see Australian films?'. Not long before, film production levels had slumped dramatically as the investment incentives offered by division 10BA of the tax Act were wound back. The heady days of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> films looked unlikely to be repeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report includes an overview of what happened to the 334 Australian drama feature films which were produced during the 1980s, most of them during the 10BA production boom. At least 66 per cent have been released theatrically, at least 43 per cent have been shown on television, and at least 72 per cent have been released on video. This compares very favourably with the chances that American film makers have of their films being released in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become the norm nowadays to talk about the success of films in terms of their box office takings. If we look at these figures alone, Australian films certainly compare unfavourably. Except during the years of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee II</EMPHASIS>, Australian films have had great difficulty in claiming even 10 per cent of total box office takings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, as in Canada, New Zealand, and throughout the European Community countries, films from the United States take a major share of the box office. To properly evaluate the performance of Australian films it is necessary to look at what can realistically be expected of relatively low budget films in a small domestic market. From this perspective, the industry has been producing some impressive results. During the moving pictures inquiry, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proof, Spotswood, A Woman's Tale,</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aya</EMPHASIS> and<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Waiting </EMPHASIS>and the co-productions <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black Robe</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green Card </EMPHASIS>were among the Australian feature films released. Through their commercial and critical success, they have helped to turn around the negative perceptions that many people had formed in recent years about the quality and popularity of Australian films. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film attracting attention at the moment is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS> which some honourable members had the good fortune to see in Parliament House last night. The director of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS>, Baz Luhrmann, has said that not only does the story of the film draw on the classic David and Goliath myth, but also the challenge of the film in the marketplace is to confront the Goliath of the American film industry. David was a worthy opponent for Goliath because he was smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theme throughout the report of the moving pictures inquiry is that the commercial and critical success of Australian films depends on the ability of Australian film-makers and distributors to become smarter in how they identify their audiences and target their markets. For a start, film-makers need better assistance in developing their projects, particularly in developing scripts and attracting the financial backing of investors and distributors. The Committee recommends that the AFC receive an additional $2m to upgrade the assistance it provides for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made recommendations concerning the need for people in the industry to receive appropriate training in marketing their films. Although it is an industry, governments support the film industry for cultural reasons. The Committee is keen to ensure that the cultural importance of Australian films is not overlooked in the movement towards better business practice. We have recommended that the Government, through the Australian Film Commission, continue to provide financial assistance to cultural distributors and exhibitors. In particular, we have sought additional funding to contribute to the refurbishment of subsidised cinemas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have time to touch on only a few of the issues which were raised during the inquiry but I should mention one more issue of major concern to the Committee and to the industry, and that is the recent review of the Australian Film Finance Corporation. The Australian Film Finance Corporation is the main source of production funding for Australian films and in its few years of operation it has made tremendous advances in getting distributors to support Australian films and in encouraging producers to develop their expertise in the business of marketing their projects. The Committee has recommended that the current level of funding be maintained in the next three years in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the House. As explained in the preface, the report is the result of the hard work and enthusiasm of many people. I would like to draw attention particularly to the contribution of the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) who chaired the Committee until being appointed to the ministry last month. Lindy Smith, the Secretary of the Committee, has drafted an elegant report with flair and intelligence and I thank her and Marlene Lyons for their effective work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say it is a great delight for me to follow the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in speaking on the tabling of this report on the moving pictures inquiry. Along with the other members of the Committee, I want to support everything that our Chairman has said, not the least being his words of commendation to the former chairperson who is in the House at the moment, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh). She took a very deep interest in all the activities of this report. Indeed, I believe during the inquiry and during our visits to the different areas that we needed to go to, she was an inspiration to all the people who were there. She certainly kept the Committee on its toes and I think the now Minister for Consumer Affairs should be very pleased with the report that has resulted from this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has been brought together by the secretariat under the directorship of Lindy Smith who, I am sorry to say, is not here today. Nevertheless, Lindy Smith and Marlene Lyons and others have been a most dedicated team. Of course, every committee knows that without a first class secretariat it really has not got much of a show as regards putting together a report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the actual inquiry, our Committee is like other committees in that it is not easy to bring together a report like this when you have changes in the secretariat throughout the report. For a good part of the inquiry we had the services of Grant Harrison, and we are happy that he has had a promotion, but we do regret that he had to cease operations with the Committee part way through the inquiry. We just want to thank him for all the work he did. But it is very important that where possible we have staff stability in terms of coming forward with an appropriate response to the references that are given to us by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things that we discovered about the film industry, and it has been mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser, is the fact that any prediction as to whether a film is going to be successful or not is very difficult to make. It really does not depend on the number of scripts that have been written, it does not necessarily depend on the size of the budget and it does not necessarily depend on whether the critics in the media support it or otherwise. That does not really guarantee that a film is going to be successful. What is critical, we have discovered, is what happens when a film is shown for the first time to an audience. If the audience clicks with that film, all other things fade into insignificance in terms of its success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the success of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee II</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> and a number of other very successful Australian films has been because they have appealed to the ordinary populace. The film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS> that has been mentioned here by the Chairman this morning, which I had the privilege of seeing last night, is a film that I could commend to anybody. Those mothers and fathers who are listening to this broadcast today can rest assured that they can take their whole family along to see a beautiful film and they will thoroughly enjoy it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Committee Chairman said, the industry has to be very wise and prudent and really try to understand its viewing audience. If we have learned anything from this inquiry, it is the basic principle that the producers and everybody else involved with the film, the marketing people and so on, right from the word go have to think very deeply about what people are thinking or will be thinking when they view that film for the first time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I must also admit to liking Australian films.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have learnt out of this inquiry if nothing else is that the Australian film industry is alive and very well. Any doubts that I had about it after the 10BA period have been dispelled by seeing the enthusiasm of the producers, the exhibitors and the distributors, and the types of films that are now coming out of Australia. My colleagues have mentioned a couple of them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS> is the latest, which unfortunately I missed last night. But there have also been <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proof</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death in Brunswick</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spotswood</EMPHASIS>. There is a whole group of Australian films now hitting the cinema which are a great success. More than that, they are an example of an Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this is what we have to look at when we look at our film industry: that it is part of us; it is part of our culture. Just as, historically, the novel supplanted poetry and plays, right now film is becoming the key centre to our culture and, if we cannot reflect Australian culture to the people who live in Australia, then what else do we have to offer them?  We will end up with a schizophrenic country that does not know who it is or where it belongs, because its main cultural input will come from overseas&mdash;and that refers, of course, to America, which utterly dominates the film market. So we have to support our industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, the report does recommend more funds to both the FFC and the AFC, and this goes against the current trend in government, which is to let market forces take their toll, if you like, or to determine what goes. I think that we have to make an exception for the film industry because it is not just the survival of an industry that is like any other industry that is at stake, it is the survival of what is the heart and soul of this country, and how we are going to present ourselves to ourselves. Let us forget overseas at the moment. Yes, it is good if we can present ourselves overseas too; but, for our survival as a country, we need to see ourselves on film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded of one incident during the inquiry when an American visitor talked to us about Australian films and about American films and went to great pains to assure us that American films were just like Australian films and that there was no reason why our whole film industry should not be American films, because after all we speak the same language and our whole culture is absolutely identical. He maintained that there just could not be any difference and that people who watched a movie could not tell whether it was Americans having breakfast or Australians having breakfast. That was his theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on in the same meeting we were asking about Australian films in America and he said, `Oh, no. They don't go down too well, you know; they don't understand your accent and, you know, you have a different way of life from what we do. The Americans don't really take to Australian movies'. That, I think, summed it up: that the Americans like to see American life on their television screens and on their film screens, and I think Australians not only like, but need to see, their culture reflected in their movies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there is a marvellous scene in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death in Brunswick</EMPHASIS> which is so Australian and so un-American. It is when the hero and the heroine, if one can call them that, go to bed together. It is a very Australian scene, so I recommend that anybody who has not seen that film should do so, to see the different way Australia deals with sex compared with how America deals with sex. </PARA>

If it had not been for the direction and inspiration that the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), the previous Chairman,  gave to the Committee and, I might say, to the industry, we would not be presenting this report today. Despite her ministerial duties, she is sitting in the chamber now and her contribution should be mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be stated that what the inquiry has achieved is a merging of different parts of the film industry to a point where each understands the other just a little bit better than it did before the inquiry started. I suppose there is no industry in Australia that has more suspicions within itself. We saw evidence of this during the inquiry, and I think we did wonders to get things together. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps to me the highlight of the whole inquiry was the seminar we had at NIDA in Sydney. This was where we could see change taking place in front of our very eyes. The follow-up by the Chairman, who went to other seminars and conferences within the industry, said a great deal about the value of an inquiry such as the one we have had. It should be borne in mind, as the report points out, that we were only one of 13 related reviews of this industry which took place in 1990-91. So I hope that the film industry, in its broadest possible perspective, does not expect too much from this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can be pleased that we are acknowledging the role of the AFC&mdash;the Australian Film Commission&mdash;and the FFC and all the excellent people. The one thing that came to me was the standard of excellence that existed throughout the industry.

Who would think a film could be successful with a blind photographer?

Along with the previous Chairman, the Minister for Consumer Affairs&mdash;who is sitting at the table, I am pleased to say&mdash;I believe that through the documentary film we can develop a real film industry. We are talking about Australian culture and Australian industries. We have to talk about Australian documentaries and about Australian issues. I was very disappointed that I was not able to go to the film festival last Sunday to see some of my friends who actually produced documentaries on that occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now generally recognised that human activities are diminishing the earth's capacity to support life. Therefore it is important to maintain a sense of urgency about protecting biodiversity. The inquiry and the report were developed specifically to be complementary to our international obligations after the Rio Earth Summit and in implementation of a national biodiversity strategy currently being drafted by the Biological Diversity Advisory Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does this admirably. It makes 30 very significant recommendations to increase and further facilitate community initiatives, to maintain biodiversity and ecologically sustainable processes across Australian landscapes and seascapes. Currently, the save the bush program is the only one which specifically directs its funding to biodiversity objectives because it focuses on the protection of remnant native vegetation. However, save the bush funds represent less than 3 per cent of the total funding provided to the four programs. The Committee therefore recommends that funding for the save the bush program should be immediately increased to $5m and to $10m by 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greening Australia is to be commended for the way it has developed the one billion trees program and for the community enthusiasm it has generated. Yet the program can, and must, go further. Specifically, national standards should be developed for revegetation activities, the collection and storage of indigenous plant seed, and the protection and maintenance of eco-adapted seed stock. The save the bush and one billion trees programs should play complementary roles in providing connectivity across the landscape through networks of wildlife corridors. We recommend that a bioregional approach and regional vegetation plans be developed to provide effective and ecologically sound implementation of community projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national soil conservation program and natural resources management strategy program contribute incidentally to the maintenance of biodiversity, particularly in altered landscapes. But with a clearer focus on biodiversity objectives and bioregional planning, these two programs could contribute a great deal to maintaining biodiversity and ecological systems. Greater attention also needs to be given to maintaining Australia's fragile soils. The Committee believes that bioregional planning, supported by a network of facilitators to provide much needed scientific advice, and formal and informal public education are important for community action in a national biodiversity strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feral animals, invasive exotic plants and the continued clearance of native vegetation were identified by the Committee as the greatest threats to biodiversity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, we looked at four projects with regard to their impact on biological diversity&mdash;the protection of nature, to put it in simple terms&mdash;and the preservation of ecosystems within many of the forested, partly forested and vegetated areas of this country. These four programs that were looked at are very heavily funded by the Government and are making a significant impact in getting back a lot of lost vegetation and making sure that a lot of endangered species have a better chance of survival. It is hoped that we have begun a return to a very vigorous desire on the part of everybody in the community to do something about the critical areas of biological diversity and the preservation of nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes it clear that the most important resource of all is the community at large.

We have asked for an increase to $10m over a period of years, because that very large project gives some of its funding to the preservation of endangered species.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that biodiversity is like a library. It is ridiculous to imagine a library that contained thousands of copies of the same book. No-one questions the existence of libraries, and libraries contain many volumes of information.

If enacted it is destined to be anathema to it. Headed `Law will hit many species: experts', the article claims that the New South Wales Government is to enshrine its so-called national resources package in legislation. That will mean that the New South Wales list of endangered fauna species is reduced from the current level of approximately 200 protected under State legislation to the 57 protected nationally. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee believes that all four Commonwealth funded community programs have greater potential to assist the preservation of biodiversity. Presently, only the save the bush program specifically directs its funding to biodiversity objectives. It receives less than 3 per cent of the total funding for all four programs. The one billion trees program is moving towards achieving biodiversity objectives. Greening Australia has been commended by the Committee, but the Committee has suggested that this program could go further by working co-operatively with the save the bush program. The Committee considered that, while the national soil conservation program and the Murray-Darling Basin national resource management strategy were not established with the preservation of biodiversity in mind, they both contribute incidentally to that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a clearer focus on these objectives and bioregional planning, these two programs could contribute a great deal to maintaining biodiversity and ecological systems and, therefore, to ecologically sustainable, long term productivity for rural industries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report clearly acknowledges the need for raising public awareness, and for formal and informal education. It is the educational aspects of grassroots programs such as Landcare which hold the key to the future. An interesting feature of the inquiry was the realisation that there is an unsatisfied thirst for knowledge evident across Australia. It is indicative of an attitudinal shift towards sustainable development. I have no doubt that across Australia this trend towards sustainable development will also continue to embrace the notion of the natural and essential `library'&mdash;biodiversity. The recommendations of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and Arts in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biodiversity: the contribution of community-based programs</EMPHASIS> will ensure that the library is maintained from the ground up by the communities concerned with and prepared to work for its preservation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I just say, before handing over to the honourable member for Oxley, that, as well as the specific issues which have been dealt with by the report and made the subject of its recommendations, I think a very important issue for non-Aboriginal Australians is for them to come to terms with and to gain an increasing respect for Aboriginal culture, including Aboriginal language. Far too infrequently do we think of our country as a multilingual nation, yet there are many Aboriginal languages still strongly in existence and surviving; others are in a state where their survival is threatened. Very few Australians who are not of Aboriginal descent speak any Aboriginal language or have been made familiar with, or acquainted with in any way, Aboriginal language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were privileged in the course of our inquiry to see one or two examples where ordinary schools have incorporated into their curriculum Aboriginal language programs, familiarising non-Aboriginal students as well as Aboriginal students with language which was traditional to those Aboriginal Australians who lived in the vicinity of the schools. I believe this is very important, not simply as a means of assisting in the maintenance of Aboriginal language but also in terms of inculcating in non-Aboriginal Australians a respect for Aboriginal culture and an appreciation for the history and the traditions of Aboriginal people. </PARA>

It makes us much more acutely aware of the fact that our society has required Aboriginal people to come to us rather than us provide an appropriate mechanism whereby we can come to the Aboriginal people and share their experiences and appreciate how difficult the transitions are for Aboriginal people, who have come to English speaking only over the period since European contact, to become fluent and capable in the English language&mdash;as unfortunately they have to be now, given the dominance of the non-Aboriginal society in which they find themselves. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was undertaken because of widespread concern over language loss amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Before European settlement of Australia, there were approximately 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. These were quite distinct languages which between them included about 600 dialects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages have been poorly understood by non-Aboriginal people over the last 200 years and a number of misconceptions about them persist. In keeping with early colonial attitudes, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were regarded as primitive and action was taken to eradicate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to popular misconceptions, these languages had complex grammars, rich vocabularies and subtle ways of describing the world around them. These languages are a means of group identification and contain embedded within them much of the culture, social values and world view of the language group. Only about one-tenth of the original languages survive today in a relatively healthy state. About a third of the original languages continue to be spoken but are under considerable threat, often being spoken by only a handful of elderly speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of a language to its speakers and descendants is much more significant than the linguistic aspects alone. This inquiry has sought to cover the wider language needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including those whose language has been partially lost. The loss of language that occurred soon after European settlement was largely due to the reduction in speaker populations from the ravages of introduced diseases, to displacement and to massacres. The healthiest Aboriginal languages today are those in areas least settled by Europeans or where settlement has occurred comparatively recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On missions and government run settlements the use of indigenous languages was frequently banned and in most cases discouraged. Children were severely affected where they were separated from their parents at an early age. The most crucial factor in language loss is the failure in the language link from parents to children. There are a range of dialects of English known collectively as Aboriginal English. The failure to recognise these separate dialects leads to several problems. Many teachers still treat Aboriginal English as an uneducated or corrupted form of standard Australian English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the failure by schools and teachers to identify, accept and take into account the separate features of Aboriginal English is a major factor in Aboriginal children's poor performance in school. In other situations, such as courts or hospitals, the failure to identify and comprehend Aboriginal English significantly limits the effectiveness of those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee spoke with as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as possible during this inquiry. Many expressed their deep concern at the loss which had already occurred in their language and the further loss that was likely. At various levels they wished to maintain, revive or retrieve as much as possible of their language. Most groups saw Aboriginal control of programs involving their language as essential, including school based programs. The Committee believes that a flexible approach is required in supporting language maintenance, with individual communities determining their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Language maintenance objectives include increasing language awareness, increasing pride in language and culture and reducing unnecessary pressures that are destructive of language. Language maintenance also involves the recording of languages and developing dictionaries and grammars. The Committee recommends that a language awareness campaign be directed to all Aboriginal communities with living traditional languages, to draw attention to the dangers posed to languages, even strong languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of understanding in the wider community about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages places unnecessary barriers in the way of the use and maintenance of these languages. Community based programs are adapted to the needs and priorities of the particular community. Regional language centres service a number of language communities and have representatives of their various language groups on their management committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the valuable role played by these centres should continue and that further centres should be established to service other language speaking regions. These regional language centres and community programs need to be adequately funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interpreter services are an essential part of language maintenance if traditional languages are not to be obliterated by the dominant language. Unfortunately, there is an almost complete lack of availability of interpreter services available. There are many situations where Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people can be disadvantaged or harmed through being misunderstood. In hospitals and courts, for example, a trained interpreter is essential. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth establish under ATSIC a separate national interpreter service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many schools now offer suitable language programs, some children coming to school with an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander language are still being taught only in English. Children are rejected by this lack of acceptance of their language and because some teachers still denigrate ATSI language whether it is a traditional language, a creole or Aboriginal English.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSI communication and social interaction styles are usually not comprehended by teachers without appropriate training and consequently such teachers cannot be effective in teaching most ATSI students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes these inadequacies have a disproportionately large negative effect on these students. The Committee believes basic teacher training should adequately prepare teachers for the range of students they are likely to teach. Schools have a very large impact on language and in the past this has been a quite destructive one. It is important that they play a constructive role in language maintenance wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All States and Territories have agreed to introduce Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies units into their curriculum to promote knowledge of ATSI cultures and languages. Despite improvements in the delivery of education services to ATSI students, education outcomes continue to fall well below the average for all students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the provision of a basic education is an essential human right that should be available to all children and young people in Australia. As a further human right, education should be available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in a way which reinforces, rather than suppresses or contradicts, their unique cultural identity. This includes an understanding and respect for their home language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that all teachers be adequately prepared by pre-service training to appreciate the special needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students; and that more specialised training be provided to teachers before they are posted to more traditional communities. This should be followed up with in-service training. Teachers in remote community schools where the vernacular is other than English should have prior training in teaching English as a second language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where appropriate, teachers should be fully fluent in the traditional language of the community. The number of ATSI teachers is still far too low. The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders graduating as teachers is increasing but is well short of meeting the demand. ATSI people gaining a degree often have more attractive employment options than teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the number of teachers fluent in a traditional language is to be increased, then remote area teacher training programs are the most likely providers of those teachers. Graduates of these programs are far more likely to stay and teach in their own community and are less likely to experience the high attrition rates for ATSI teachers elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommends that adequate resources are made available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remote area teacher education, so that the growing demand for such training can be met and accreditation standards maintained. The Committee recommends that the availability of language teacher and linguistics training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1788 until the 1970s government policies and programs involved harsh assimilatory pressures in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language and identity were largely denigrated and repressed. The beginning of recognition and support for some ATSI languages occurred in the 1970s through bilingual education and other institutions. The 1980s have been characterised by a resurgence in ATSI language and awareness and the beginning of government sponsored language maintenance efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national Aboriginal languages program was established in 1987 under the national policy on languages. Following an earlier Green Paper, the Commonwealth released a White Paper in September 1991 on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Language</EMPHASIS>, containing an Australian language and literacy policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the national Aboriginal language program was criticised for some short-comings it did begin to redress the serious neglect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and gave a large degree of control to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Regional language centres grew and played a significant role in the program as well as direct assistance being given to many community based programs. A review of the program in 1989 found that the educational, linguistic and cultural potential of the program was enormous. The review also found DEET management of the program had an overly educational orientation, lacked clarity in program goals and provided little co-ordination between projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is critical of DEET's limited outlook and management of the NALP program. Attempts by DEET to transfer NALP functions into an education program, the AEP, were totally inappropriate. An attempt was also made through the Green Paper to limit language maintenance activities to 20 languages, claimed to be the only ones where language was being actively transmitted to children. This ignored the broader language service needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Fortunately this extremely restrictive view did not reappear in the White Paper. The Aboriginal languages initiatives program announced in the White Paper supports a national network of regional Aboriginal language committees, extending the present number of centres and increasing the level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A conference of ATSI language organisations in December 1991 agreed to a structure for the network. A further conference in Alice Springs this week is finalising that structure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to this report from the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language maintenance. I feel some personal involvement with it, as was mentioned in the conduct of the inquiry and report, because I made a suggestion to the Minister that we study Aboriginal languages was its genesis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a personal interest in Aboriginal languages since meeting an acquaintance, a chap called Nick Reid, quite some time ago. He did a PhD on studying Aboriginal languages in the Peppimenarti region of the Northern Territory, yet this highly trained and highly dedicated worker found it totally impossible to find any work in his chosen area of study. It struck me as strange that in a country like this we paid such scant attention to our own native languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I started my job as shadow Minister for aboriginal affairs, I have to say I had absolutely no idea about the nature, extent or the loss of Aboriginal languages. My very first experience with Aboriginal languages was on my first visit to the Northern Territory. I was staying in the Kakadu National Park and I was at the Cooinda Hotel in the south of the park. There is no television there, limited radio, and I did not have much to do. I was lying in my room at night and I turned on CAAMA&mdash;Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association&mdash;and they had a program in Warlpiri. I found it quite extraordinary that here I was in my own country listening to a radio and a language that I did not know existed and had never heard before. Even though I understood absolutely nothing of it, I lay there in bed with the radio on for an hour, absolutely haunted by this wonderful language that was totally new to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since having a look at the issue of Aboriginal language in this report, it has become obvious to me that the extent of Aboriginal language loss in this country is actually unparalleled anywhere in the world. At the time of original European settlement, there were 250 totally distinct Aboriginal languages spoken in Australia. Today there are possibly 50, and only 20 of those could be described as vaguely healthy and not under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians have absolutely no realisation that we have 50, totally distinct, unique Australian languages. There are at least 36,000 Aborigines who would speak an Aboriginal language as the language of first choice in the home and there are probably about 2,000 Aborigines in Australia who speak absolutely no English whatsoever. This is almost certainly an underestimate because it is on census figures, and one thing the census does have some difficulty in doing is in taking account of the more mobile Aborigines in remote Australia, and they are the people that tend not to speak English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some interesting experiences with Aboriginal languages as shadow Minister. On my visits to central Australia&mdash;and I go there quite frequently&mdash;I actually have to take an interpreter with me when I go outside Alice. Again, this is something that on a first occasion I found absolutely extraordinary, that in my own country I was using an interpreter. People do not realise the extreme multilingualism of Aborigines in central Australia. The woman I use as an interpreter speaks eight Aboriginal languages fluently as well as English. These are not dialects; they are not even as similar as Italian and Spanish. They are totally distinct languages and she speaks pretty good English as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a wonderful experience visiting a place called Ipolera which is a very small out-station on the way to Palm Valley, about 250 kilometres west of Alice Springs in the desert. There is a tiny school there with about 12 pupils, all of whom are Aranda people. These kids ranged from about five to eight and none of them spoke any English whatsoever. The teacher in the school had been there two weeks. She had come from Newport Primary School in Melbourne and she spoke no Aranda and the kids spoke no English and they were having a pretty wonderful, chaotic time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the recommendations in this report relate to schooling. This is vitally important because we do not realise that, for a good number of Aboriginal kids coming to school in remote Australia, English is not a second language; it is a foreign language. The fact that we do not deal with it in those terms means that these Aboriginal kids are really way behind the eight ball to start with and are disadvantaged for the whole time of their schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the work of the Committee I would particularly like to thank the Committee Secretary, Allan Kelly, and Peter Ratas, who were involved principally with this report; the other members of the Committee; and the other members of the secretariat. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) on the excellent way he conducted the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a report which was unanimous across both sides of politics. I thank the Subcommittee and particularly the Subcommittee Chair for the flexibility shown in addressing some concerns I had very late in the piece. I am sure that that was frustrating but I appreciate that they were able to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee, this Committee visited some very remote parts of the country. Several memories of those visits stand out. I was incredibly impressed with the work of the language centres around Australia. These places, by and large, work on pretty tight budgets. They make ends meet with bits of string and rusty razor blades and yet they really do some wonderful work. In many cases, they are the only thing between the death of Aboriginal languages in certain areas and their survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was staggered, quite frankly, to have an Aboriginal woman in Western Australia tell me during this inquiry that even today in parts of the country Aboriginal kids might be punished for speaking their own language at school in the playground. I would have thought we had gone way beyond that as a country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed to see the extent of the bilingual education system in the Northern Territory. It may not be perfect, and a number of people expressed serious reservations about it, but it is simply so far ahead of anything else available anywhere in Australia that I think the Northern Territory deserves some credit for it. As I said, particularly in the Territory and in parts of Western Australia, bilingual education is vitally important because, for a good number of kids coming into school, English is a totally foreign language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one recommendation I would like to specifically mention, and that is No. 32. The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth fund an institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages within a university. I believe this is absolutely vital because what Aboriginal language in Australia desperately needs is a national focus. It does not have that national focus; it does not have that centre for study to act as coordinator; it does not have any one place that is really acting as a focus for academic work on Aboriginal languages. I believe that, if we are to truly value our indigenous languages, it is essential that this country have a national centre for the study of Aboriginal languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I find that Australia's own attitude to its Aboriginal languages has been one of complete neglect and indifference. It is absolutely extraordinary that, as a country, we can spend $60m on a centre for the study of ethnic languages, none of which are under threat in their own countries; yet, until very recently, we have spent almost nothing on supporting and maintaining those languages that are unique to Australia, those ones which actually are under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it absolutely extraordinary that in a State like New South Wales&mdash;although I do not particularly single it out because it is no worse than any other State in Australia&mdash;the State Government can go to the effort of allowing a single student to sit Estonian in year 12 and yet there is not a single Aboriginal student anywhere in Australia who can do his own language as a year 12 subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my hope that this report will raise the awareness of this issue around the country and that it might help people realise that we have a wonderful heritage here. It is also my hope that my kids and my grandchildren and people to come will actually see Aboriginal languages not as something of no relevance to them but as something that is uniquely Australian, importantly Australian and very much under threat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first acknowledge, as others have done, the efforts of the Subcommittee Chairman, the Subcommittee members and the role of the secretariat staff, particularly Allan Kelly and Peter Ratas, for the very valuable work they did in producing the report of the inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language maintenance. As the previous speaker, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), has just said, this is a report which has been endorsed unanimously by both the Opposition and Government members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that does not suggest that we agree on everything. Certainly there are aspects of what the previous speaker said that I would not agree with totally. Nevertheless, the thrust and the general goodwill that went into the production of this report is, I think, a tribute to all honourable members of the Subcommittee. I think the report will make a very valuable contribution to the issue of Aboriginal language maintenance in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments I have left I want to say in relation to this report and its development and subsequent recommendations that, as a non-Aboriginal Australian, as a white Australian, I am at times embarrassed by the arrogance, paternalism and air of cultural superiority that has for so long been part of the hidden agenda in our dealings with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. We as a nation have yet to come to terms with the need to accord proper recognition to the legitimacy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and their importance in cultural maintenance and continuity. This report, I think, does a great deal to rectify that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a generalisation, governments and bureaucracies at all levels have still to come to terms with the necessity to communicate and deal with Aboriginal people in their first language rather than in English. They have yet to come to terms with the need to employ appropriately qualified Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to assist them in dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They have yet to recognise the need to put in context their communications with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to ensure that the messages they think they are giving to these people are, in fact, the messages that are being received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many government departments or agencies, at a Commonwealth, State or local government level, or for that matter non-government agencies, employ interpreters, even on a casual basis, when they are dealing with people for whom English may be a second, third or fourth language, as is the case in some parts of my own electorate, and whose comprehension and understanding of the English language is minimal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A clear message to the Committee that has come out during the course of its discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around Australia was that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be the ones to determine what needs to be done to strengthen, maintain or preserve their languages. It is they who are best placed to identify their own needs and identify strategies required to address those needs. This does not mean that governments have no role or can wash their hands of the matter. Part of the Government's task is to provide information on training and other assistance available in order that decisions reached by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can be effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to do this effectively it is imperative that government agencies instil in government officers a respect for Aboriginal languages, that they recognise and utilise regional language centres and management committees, and that they ensure through negotiation with centres and committees that training and other support programs which are available are client driven, not driven by the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the use of interpreters. This was a matter which was addressed by the Committee in its recommendations. It must be recognised that this need for interpreters is important in both direct and non-direct negotiations with government agencies. Many of us, I am sure in this parliament, will be aware of the difficulties that communities, organisations and individuals face in trying to access program funds which have complex guidelines and require substantial submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is moving slowly towards a proper recognition of the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture in this country. This emphasises the crucial importance of Aboriginal languages and language initiatives programs. In this respect, as in others, the establishment of the Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages, which was set up formally two days ago in Alice Springs and which was the result of a follow-up of a conference recently held in Adelaide, is to be commended. I would hope that we would see it as the main vehicle for advice to governments at all levels, and to non-government agencies, on matters to do with Aboriginal languages. A delegation of members of the Federation will be coming to Canberra to talk to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and to talk to ATSIC commissioners about their concerns and what they believe should happen in relation to Aboriginal language maintenance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report tabled on behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am very proud that I was a member of the Committee and had the opportunity to have some input to the report. I am very impressed with my Committee colleagues and with the secretariat and the work they put in in compiling the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly reflect on the observations that I made in travelling around Australia with the Committee and those of a previous time when I had the opportunity of caravaning around Australia in the early seventies. One of my experiences then was having the privilege in Alice Springs of meeting a tribal elder whose English was very scanty at best. I was very impressed with the dignity of that particular man and the way in which he carried himself. He demonstrated to us at that time a dance called the dance of the emu. It was a great privilege to see that and I have parts of the performance on super 8 film. I could not help reflecting at that time on the difference between that man and some of the younger Aboriginals who, unfortunately, because of substance abuse were rounded up in a cattle truck and taken back to the mission station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The despair that I felt then was very much reflected in the despair that we saw within the Aboriginal people in many areas we went to during the Committee's hearings. It seems that, while there have been strides made for the Aboriginal people to take control of their own lives, there is a long way to go before they have the dignity and the independence they rightly deserve within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report somewhat highlights the situation regarding the state of the languages. There were 250 languages 200 years ago and 90 so-called living languages today. That means 160 languages have been lost. In my area of Victoria, the Koori people have lost their language and are now trying to keep their dignity by learning aspects of the Murray language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 90 living languages, 20 have been specified as healthy, 50 have fewer than 100 speakers, and 20 have 10 speakers or more. A look at the so-called healthy languages shows only 10 of those have 1,000 or more speakers. I cannot help wondering whether, as communications get better&mdash;with satellite television and better transport and communications across this nation&mdash;what has happened in Victoria, Tasmania, parts of New South Wales and southern Western Australia will happen to the rest of the Aboriginal community and their languages will be lost. That would be a great tragedy which, as mentioned by my colleague the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), urgently requires a centre of excellence at a university to try to reverse the tide. At the end of the day, we in this place can do very little about it other than give support to the Aboriginal people. It is their responsibility to maintain their own language, with the support and services that we can give from this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly on Aboriginal English. It is considered to be spoken more in central Australia than in other areas, but I think it is spoken right across southern Australia. The children using Aboriginal English come to school disadvantaged because the teachers within those schools do not appreciate that the language the children are speaking is a subculture of English. Those children have an extraordinarily poor learning experience in their first few months at school. Consequently, as a race of people they are very often behind the eight ball from the first day. I find that to be a great tragedy. I recommend to people reading the report that they note its recommendations that we do something about acknowledging that those children speak a somewhat modified English and that their teachers must have special training to make sure those children are not disadvantaged throughout their careers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the third occasion on which the Standing Committee on Procedure has looked at Question Time. Neither of the two previous reports has been adopted, nor have they been debated by the House. Unfortunately, there are a number of Procedure Committee reports, some of them of considerable significance, which are at present unresolved and undebated in this Parliament. It is necessary, if the Procedure Committee is to continue to operate, for some consideration to be given to these things and for some time to be set aside whereby the House can in fact discuss recommendations made by a Committee that it set up for that very purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report reflects the practice of the House on Question Time and it does not set out to resolve the administrative problems that have grown up during Question Time, more particularly over the last 20 years. It is a fact that Question Time has existed since Federation. It has formally been in the Standing Orders since around 1950 and those Standing Orders have remained largely unchanged for at least the last 30 years. The practice of Question Time in the House has changed materially and any graph and any simple examination of Question Time will show that the number of questions being asked is in decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to sort out dorothy dixers from backbenchers' question on the Government side, so I am not being unfair in not discussing them. However, it is possible to show that the number of questions actually asked by backbenchers on the Opposition side, which originate from that source, have declined, over at least three governments, almost in parallel with the numbers of questions being answered at Question Time. The number of questions asked at the table by the Opposition, which are of a different character from those of backbenchers, does reflect in the time for Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the Committee's belief that we can alter that or change the practice by devising standing orders, nor can the administration of the House be written into the Standing Orders&mdash;that is a matter for the presiding officer in the House itself. What we are proposing is to simplify standing order 144 and to extend the terms of 145, both of which are to specify in simpler terms, without a multitude of subclauses, what questions should consist of and how they should be framed, and to tighten up the relevancy rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other and more controversial part of the report, I think, is that we are suggesting that the Speaker, at the start of the Parliament or of a session or at such other time as the person in the chair believes appropriate, should make a statement of principle about the way in which Question Time should operate, which should include some of those things now in standing order 144 and also the types of standards that the Chair would expect and intends to enforce. The intention of the Committee in this is to reinforce the right of the Chair and the power of the Chair to function in the way which the responsibilities of the Chair indicate that the position deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that in the long run&mdash;I know this places on the Chair an onus which probably should be avoided&mdash;the chamber must be run by the Presiding Officer with the support of the members of the chamber. We are seeking to strengthen the authority of the Presiding Officer, in this particular matter the Speaker, by placing the responsibility on, and the authority in, the person who occupies the chair in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Standing Orders, we believe, do not reflect the practice of the House. I counted on one occasion a question which was out of order on five separate counts in accordance with standing order 144. No Speaker in modern times would have declared that out of order, and therefore the standing order itself should be modified because the House obviously does not accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to endorse the contents of this report of the Procedure Committee on standing orders governing questions and to compliment the Chairman and the staff who have assisted in its preparation. This report represents the next stage in the Committee's task of completely reviewing the Standing Orders of the Parliament. Question Time has become something of an epicentre of the parliamentary process. TV has added to its aura, and it certainly is the focus for much of the attention of the media and the community on parliamentary debate. The gladiatorial atmosphere that these days is so much a feature of Question Time has certainly altered its method of operation and perhaps also, in many ways, its effectiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questioner tries to make an impact in a few seconds; the response can take as long as is required. It is beyond question, and it is documented in the report, that there has been a significant decline in the number of questions asked. In 1976, 1,447 questions were asked during the parliamentary year and in 1990 there were 453. In 1976, we averaged 20 questions a day. Currently we are averaging just over 11, and yet the actual length of time occupied by Question Time has, if anything, increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question Time has certainly ceased to be a time of genuine inquiry from Ministers who are able to provide information, and all members, and indeed the public, are in many ways dissatisfied with the procedures that occur at the present time. From 1976 to the early 1990s, the majority of Opposition questions came from the backbench. Now they mostly come from the leadership group. It has become something of a point scoring exercise, and the advent of television has increased that. On the Government side, questions are merely a prompt for the Minister to make a policy speech or to bucket the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread community concern, too, particularly as television has attracted greater attention to the processes of Question Time. The public thinks that Parliament is always like Question Time, and that has damaged this institution in the eyes of so many of the Australian people. That really has significant consequences for our democratic process. Question Time is conducted with almost complete disregard for the written Standing Orders. I do not say that to criticise the Speaker: he has regularly drawn attention to the fact that, for Question Time to function, he needs to be very lenient in interpreting what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost all of the questions offend one or more of the Standing Orders, and similarly with most of the answers. We do considerable damage to the integrity of Standing Orders if Parliament decides, either by agreement or practice or gradual erosion, that we will overlook the existence of certain of the Standing Orders. If we deliberately ignore some Standing Orders, we really question the authority of them all. If we have no intention of complying with the written Standing Orders&mdash;if our practice is somewhat different&mdash;then we ought to get rid of what is written and make it meet the requirements of the current time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)commends those elements of the legal profession which are committed to eliminating remaining anti-competitive elements of the organisation of the profession; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)expresses its support for moves within the legal profession to achieve the result that lawyers admitted and entitled to practise in one State have automatic reciprocal rights throughout the other States.</PARA>
<PARA>Much attention has been paid over recent years to the state and the costs of the legal profession. It has been the subject of a Senate inquiry and the subject of reports from law reform commissions in different jurisdictions throughout Australia. It is also, of course, a matter of some political concern, because members of parliament are naturally asked by their constituents about how they can be adequately represented, given the costs of legal services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard the legal profession itself has begun to debate a number of very important and commendable steps, and some breakthroughs have occurred in different jurisdictions throughout this country. For example, in New South Wales some forms of advertising of professional services are now permitted, and there has begun a slow erosion of some of the more anti-competitive elements which have hindered the profession's ability to present itself to the public as concerned with the public's interests rather than its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To introduce my contribution in this House, I want to take members back to the adjournment debate in which I participated on 26 March 1992, in which I tabled the results of a survey of lawyers' fees which I had conducted in the electorate of Denison. I also incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and it is reproduced there&mdash;the scale of charges for conveyancing that operates in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take members to the results of the survey. The survey was carried out in February and March 1992 and covered 64 firms and individual practitioners. The questions asked of the firms concerned a quote for their services as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband blew 0.125 on the breathalyser and needs legal representation in court. He will plead guilty and has no prior convictions. He does not need a restricted driver's licence. What would your firm quote for this service?.</PARA>
<PARA>The second question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband and I have just bought a house in Glenorchy, a suburb of Hobart, for $90,000. The bank has okayed us to borrow $80,000. We will put up the rest. The owner says his bank has the certificate of title and they will need to pay out the current mortgage. Can we have a quote on your legal costs to do this conveyancing?</PARA>
<PARA>The third question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the way, my husband and I have not got a will. We have only got one child. We would like to make mutual wills leaving everything to each other, but to our daughter if we both die. Could you give us a quote on that also?</PARA>
<PARA>Among the key findings were that lawyers' fees varied widely. For example, someone seeking conveyancing on a $90,000 house could save up to $400, with quotes ranging from $500 through to $900. With the fee for wills, the quotes ranged from no charge at all through to a $300 cost for doing wills for both husband and wife. With the breathalyser charge, quotes ranged from $80 through to another quote of $300 to $500. If the cheapest quote was taken each time, the total bill would have been $580 for the three services, compared with $1,700 if the highest quote had been accepted&mdash;a difference of $1,120. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, almost all lawyers were happy to provide a quote for service over the telephone, and some lawyers were willing to negotiate and offer discounts to attract business. For example, 11 firms and individual lawyers offered to draft a couple's will free if the couple placed their conveyancing work with the practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very tellingly, in terms of what I will be saying later in relation to the remaining anti-competitive practices within the profession, just under half of all practices surveyed were prepared to quote prices below that recommended by the Law Society's scale for conveyancing work. I received considerable publicity when I said that the survey shows that no-one should hesitate to ring around to ask for quotes for legal services. Generally, lawyers will be helpful and straightforward when asked for a quote, and it is important for people to be willing to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing this survey, I was not intending to attack the profession but to point out, as this survey did, that, in fact, the profession is far more competitive in practice than it is in theory. I believe that it is in the profession's interests to move more rapidly and more straightforwardly to abandon those shards of anti-competitive practice which still distort its public image. For example, it seems to me that there is no possible argument against permitting members of the profession to advertise which services they provide and to advertise the fees they charge for those services. It is anachronistic that we still have the rules against touting which are enforced by those who are already well established, principally against those less well established firms that are seeking to break into the provision of legal services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the survey that I conducted, interestingly, just under half of those firms that actually do offer services are prepared to quote under-scale fees when asked. So there is a significant market in legal fees. It is a competitive market but, at the moment, it is one which is distorted by the profession's refusal to permit advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we need to look to the statutory scales of fees that exist. It seems to me that the profession really cannot present itself as being competitive when, in a sense, it allows itself to be bound by rules that prescribe minimum fees. Those scales, which exist in almost every jurisdiction&mdash;for conveyancing services, particularly&mdash;are to my mind a blight on the legal profession. The profession should be competitive and it should be entitled to charge only what the market bears. Importantly, it should be enabled to compete on price; and that would, I believe, bring fees down significantly. This is the view of the Victorian Law Reform Commission and I understand that the Victorian Government is moving to implement its recommendations that would permit advertising and encourage some competition on price. I believe that people have a legitimate concern about the price of legal services; they need to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there are rules about the separation of the profession into the roles of solicitor and barrister. It is not a division which is manifested in my home State. In Tasmania, with few exceptions, people are admitted as practitioners and, therefore, practise both as barristers and solicitors. In that capacity, I have had the experience of taking a brief, preparing that brief, taking it through the courts and arguing the outcome in the High Court. That is not a circumstance that prevails in other jurisdictions where solicitors, often with great expertise in particular areas, are precluded, because of the division of the profession, from taking matters into court. This would not turn the known legal world upside down. Not every solicitor would wish to perform the role of a barrister, nor would every litigious lawyer wish to conduct the carriage of litigation on the papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present division, however, is one which adds to costs. It is not justifiable in terms of competition theory. The law profession should abandon it as soon as practicable and move to the sensible situation that exists, and has existed for a very long time, in my home State of Tasmania. Another rule that needs to be abolished is that of the two-thirds counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the rule in Rondel v. Worsley, that barristers cannot be sued for negligence when carrying out their advocacy functions in courts. Again, this is an anachronistic rule. It is said to exist because a barrister should not be frightened from advancing a bold proposition in litigation. But should not a surgeon equally not be frightened to carry out a bold procedure that is necessary in the course of surgery, and similarly for others in so many other fields of professional endeavour? The test, obviously, is whether a reasonable person, carrying out the profession with proper skill, would have carried out some procedure; and I do not see any reason why such a rule should not apply to barristers as it does to others. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But there are some about in society at the moment, looking at the legal profession, who take that attitude. As I said, I am glad that the honourable member sees that there is a place for the legal profession, and that what we are talking about are some anti-competitive practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support what he says in terms of, for example, reciprocal rights to practise in Australian States. In fact, one of the projects of the Australian Young Lawyers Section Council, when I was a member, was to work towards reciprocal rights, and I see that work is still continuing and still needed. It always struck me as absurd that, upon admission in Victoria, I could then be admitted to the High Court of Australia, which allowed me to practise in the highest court of this land; which allowed me to appear in a Federal Court in any State of Australia; which allowed me to appear in any Family Court in Australia; yet which disallowed me from appearing in any other State, in even the lowliest  magistrates  or  equivalent  court. That is simply an absurdity in terms of practice,  and  a  restriction  which  should  not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of cross-vesting legislation&mdash;whereby actions which are originated or initiated in one State can now be heard in another, or actions which are initiated in the Federal Court can be heard in a State court&mdash;again points to the antiquated nature of restrictions on lawyers who are admitted in one State practising in another State. Nor do I believe that such reciprocity should be limited to Australia. If, for example, we are serious about the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand, then I cannot see why there should not, equally, be an interchange of labour between Australia and New Zealand, whether it be in relation to shearers or to lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of competition, as the honourable member for Denison has pointed out, is the one which is subject to considerable attention and comment over recent times. There is the current Senate inquiry into the cost of legal services; there is a Trade Practices Commission inquiry into restrictive practices and rules of the legal profession; and there have recently been three discussion papers from the Law Reform Commission of Victoria also related to similar subjects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a number of practices have been anti-competitive, and the matter of reciprocal rights is a good example of that. Another example is the rule, which existed in some States, that a senior counsel could not appear in court without a junior counsel and, in addition, that the junior counsel was entitled, regardless of expertise or contribution to the preparation or conduct of the case, to two-thirds of the fee which the QC charged. It is quite clear that those practices are not practices which we ought to encourage. A further example of an antiquated rule is that a barrister could not visit a solicitor's office. One ironical result of this rule is that members of the Bar who were married to solicitors could not visit the offices of those solicitors, with whom they ate and slept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the specialty of practitioners, subject to some appropriate safeguards, should be the subject of public notification. I, for one, consider it appropriate that the professions maintain standards and do not, for example, allow advertising and flashing neon lights, as is the case in some parts of the United States of America. There is also the more tasteless example of the American lawyer who drove an old hearse around town upon which were printed the words, `Make a will first: call such and such a number'. There are other examples of tasteless advertising by some of our American colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such episodes contribute little to real competitiveness in the legal profession, but public knowledge of the specialties of the practitioners is important. I join with the honourable member for Denison in saying that the right to be able to advertise legal services, within certain limits of taste, and advertise some pricing in relation to what services are being provided, in reality reflects the practice operated and understood by most members of the profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live in an age in which knowledge is becoming increasingly splintered. I recall, for example, that the Royal Society was founded in the chambers of a barrister, William Ball, but in the centuries since knowledge has become increasingly diverse and splintered. For example, these days not only does the physical scientist not understand the work of the social scientist but within each field there are increasing specialties. The same is true of the law. The days when the companies law of this country was contained in 308 sections and the Income Tax Assessment Act totalled only 268 sections were the last that the single practitioner had some chance of grasping the whole of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those days have passed. Recently, for example, we saw some 1,500 pages of sales tax legislation passed in this House on about 48 hours notice. That raises the related issue of whether we, as parliamentarians, are responsible for an increasing volume of complex law. But the recognition of the changing face of legal practice and the inappropriate practices of a past less complex age do not mean that all practices are uncompetitive and inappropriate. An independent Bar, I believe, is a good example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, and I believe the case is similar in Tasmania, the legal profession is theoretically fused. That is, upon admission a lawyer is entitled to practise as either a solicitor or a barrister. In fact, in Victoria some 1,000 lawyers, or about 12 per cent of the profession&mdash;it may be even more now&mdash;practise exclusively as barristers. I was interested to note the remarks about the fusion of the profession in Tasmania. Members of the Tasmanian profession often use barristers from Victoria to argue cases in court where some specialised advocacy is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why a person admitted as a barrister and solicitor, and who chooses to practise solely as a barrister, cannot in Victoria obtain a practising certificate from the Law Institute of Victoria and practise without any regulation and not be subject, for example, to the rules of the Bar. Indeed, in this respect, the Bar, as a voluntary organisation, is no different from a group of real estate agents, or a group of independently owned supermarkets comprising, say, 10 or 12 per cent of the market, deciding to market their services under an identical logo and provide agreed services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, we do not say in this country that the Professionals Real Estate group is anti-competitive. So we need to distinguish between the nature of a group coming together which does not involve a monopoly and those practices which do involve some degree of anti-competition. Increasingly, as we recognise the specialisation of legal practice, we also see that it applies to advocacy. Some assume that because groups of advocates band together voluntarily their practice is, in itself, anti-competitive. Indeed, there is evidence from overseas that the specialisation of advocacy is one which ought to be preserved. I want to quote a comment on the fusion in Canada. Roland Williams, a distinguished Canadian lawyer who practised for a considerable number of years, first in Canada and then for a large commercial firm in London, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus fusion, as applied to Canada's more de-centralized circumstances, has produced a firm-orientated legal system, with barristers generally overstretched, tending to be generalists rather than specialists in particular fields of law, not given enough courtroom time to develop forensic skills early or fully enough, outnumbered, sometimes dominated, by the solicitor members of their firm, obliged by their membership to give priority to their firms' largest clients, occasionally exposed to pressures from which they should obviously be free, private rather than fully public figures.</PARA>
<PARA>That criticism was repeated by the former Chief Justice of the United States of America, Chief Justice Burger, who said that in his experience, and having looked at the trials and the records of trials in America, many of those who practised as advocates in the American courts system were not fully qualified in terms of experience and ability to do so. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my intuitive judgment based on these comparative observations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>between England and America&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that a case that is tried on our side generally taking 5 days or 10 days will be tried here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in England&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in one day or a day and a half or two days at most, both civil and criminal.</PARA>
<PARA>So we do need to support those elements of the profession who are moving, in a genuine way, towards making the profession competitive and efficient. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four speakers in this debate this morning are, of course, all lawyers, and if we look around the chamber we will, despite the opinions of some members, find a great number of lawyers in this Federal Parliament. Of course, that same pattern is repeated throughout the various parliaments of the Australian States. Because of that, lawyers have had a great deal of power in terms not only of implementing or interpreting laws but also in actually enacting laws in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we sit in judgment in this House and debate at great length the various needs of the Australian economy and as we wax lyrical about the needs to get the waterfront in order and get the transport system in order and make sure that electricity systems in Australia are competitive and that Government business operates in an effective and an efficient manner, I think it is indeed refreshing&mdash;and I congratulate the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for raising this&mdash;that we as lawyers turn the spotlight upon ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come from a profession which has a very long history of running what could be described as a closed shop. It is a profession which has gone to great lengths in protecting its own rights and privileges and it is a profession which has been extraordinarily effective in doing that. Again, and maybe in no small measure, that may be due to the fact that there are a number of lawyers in Australian parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are starting to see moves to make the legal profession in Australia more competitive but the speed at which it is doing so is like the nature of the profession itself. The profession varies greatly between States because the legal profession is not a nationally based profession in Australia. It is very much a State based profession and each of the States has its own law society and Bar association, and the rules which operate within those States are determined at the State level. Hence, one can get quite marked differences in the operation of the profession in the various States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Queensland we continue to distinguish between solicitors and barristers. We have some very strongly anti-competitive provisions still in place, but in other areas the profession is moving ahead. It really is quite incredible to think that it has been possible for national firms to operate in Queensland under their national firm name only since July 1990. Prior to July 1990 the rules of the Law Society in Queensland allowed a firm to operate under a national name only if the partners of that firm were admitted and basically practising within the State. That change came about only as a result of action by the Law Society in July 1990. It was only a couple of years ago that that occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see that only very recently has there been a move to allow solicitors admitted in other States to practise in Queensland. That only occurred after a very fiercely fought battle which went to the High Court in the end, and that again gives an example of how fiercely the legal profession has protected itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of issues that need to be taken up. We have canvassed the issue of advertising. That is now allowed in Queensland to a specified limit. A solicitor cannot advertise as to price of service, though he can advertise in terms of a specialty which a particular firm or individual may have. That is a step forward. We have seen a fairly competitive environment in terms of some legal costs, particularly conveyancing, but the legal profession maintains a monopoly on conveyancing in Queensland and is resisting very strongly any attempt to break that monopoly down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very important issues that are being addressed not only in this Parliament, which is appropriate, but, as the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) pointed out, in a range of other forums, and I do hope that we can modernise the legal profession, which will be for the benefit of all Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

My colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) has quite rightly made the admission that all four of us speaking in this debate are lawyers, and behind him is the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), who is also a lawyer. Those contributing to this debate have taken a sensible approach. I was concerned that there was going to be a bit of old-fashioned profession bashing, but it has not eventuated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) did mention the public interest, and I would hope that any debate about the legal profession or indeed any other profession in this country would come back to the question of the public interest. After all, any of these rules or any decisions that are made at a State or Federal level should have as a primary concern the protection of the public interest. In that respect, I was interested to hear the honourable member's views on fee scales, for example. That is a very vexed question. Do we abolish fee scales and hope that the competitive forces will take over, or do we end up running the very grave risk that the thing will blow out of the water? In the State of Victoria, given that the judiciary and others have a very significant impact on the setting of the scale of costs, I believe that there is sufficient overview to protect the public interest in that regard. Were we to remove it, I think there would be a great deal of concern that it may have an adverse impact on the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, there are three inquiries which have considered or are about to consider anti-competitive elements within the profession. They are the Senate inquiry into the cost of justice, the Law Reform Commission of Victoria inquiry into access to justice and the Trade Practices Commission examination of the legal profession. I am pleased that the Law Institute of Victoria has taken a very proactive role in relation to the question of competition and the question of changing the profession and moving the profession as quickly as possible into the 1990s. I am sure that is not the same for all institutes throughout the country, but the Victorian Law Institute has indeed done that. </PARA>

On 21 May this year the Law Institute council decided to hold a referendum on fee advertising to allow the profession a chance to reconsider the ban that had previously been imposed. By mid-July the results of that referendum will be known. So the profession itself is indeed addressing these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting point is that the Law Reform Commission's inquiry in Victoria acknowledged that it is very hard to judge whether some of the present restrictions were in fact anti-competitive or whether they were justifiable in the public interest. I would therefore caution against any frenzied attempt to remove a large number of these restrictions until we can establish that the public interest is going to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question the Law Institute is addressing in relation to the national admission to practise&mdash;the question of mutual recognition of qualifications and reciprocal admission&mdash;is currently being considered, I gather, by the Consultative Committee of State and Territorial Law Admitting Authorities. In May of this year, the Victorian Council approved a submission to the committee, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Institute has been keen to see uniform admission requirements throughout Australia for some time. However, it would be concerned if those requirements were such as to stifle change.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the other part of the debate: if we step too far, there is the risk that there will be restrictive practices. All of those areas have got to be very carefully addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Institute is addressing the question of restrictive practices by barristers. Others have made comment about barristers not being able to attend solicitors' offices. They are, quite obviously, anachronistic regulations and need to be addressed. But I do stress to the House that the public interest has got to be the sole concern of this House and any direction from either our State colleagues or ourselves  or  our  colleagues  in  the  other place must be specifically targeted towards that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)welcomes the initial steps taken by the European Community to lower its massive levels of agricultural protection; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)urges that the USA match these reductions in the interests of freeing up world trade in primary products.</PARA>
<PARA>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT as is it known, began operating back in 1947 with the purpose of winding back protection levels in traded goods around the world. Agricultural goods were not included amongst those goods, reflecting the desire for national food security and self-sufficiency in food after World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in the 40-odd years that GATT has operated, it has had considerable success. Although GATT has come under much criticism for a slow pace of change in recent times, I believe that these critics overlooked the remarkable success that GATT has had in restraining and winding back protection levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1947 the average level of protection in industrial countries was of the order of 40 per cent, whereas today it is closer to 5 per cent. During the period of operation of GATT, world trade has increased 20-fold, and the membership of GATT has quadrupled&mdash;which locks in more countries to lower protection levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas agricultural policy, which has been exempt from GATT until recently, is a very complex area. It is very entrenched and highly emotional. It is moulded by a wide variety of cultural, historical, political and economic influences. This has led to a vast bureaucratic infrastructure with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there have been successes in winding back agricultural protection. I highlight a couple: Australia now sends considerable quantities of beef to South Korea, and the beef quotas in Japan have now been abolished and converted to tariffs. Under the GATT rules, these cannot be increased; in fact, they are coming down at 10 per cent per year. Recently, there was a decrease from 70 per cent to 60 per cent in the Japanese tariff quota on beef, and that will eventually fall to 40 per cent. The projected levels of beef into Japan will increase from 335 kilotonnes last year to the order of 500 kilotonnes in 1995. When we remember that Australia exports something slightly in excess of 50 per cent of that, these increased figures are very significant to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if we could crack getting rice into Japan, that would really be a great victory. I believe that will come. It will take time because it is entrenched into the Japanese mentality that they must supply all their own rice. Nevertheless, GATT will play an important part in breaking down those barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight those successes. GATT has played a large part in stabilising protection and in lowering it in many cases. If we walk away from the Uruguay Round&mdash;as the attempts to lower agricultural protection are known&mdash;which many want, I believe that we will be walking away from stabilising protection levels. We will be walking away from decreasing protection levels and this could have devastating consequences for Australia. Any short term win that we might have from this will be more than outbalanced by major long term losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round, which was originally set up in 1986 to wind back agricultural protection, was scheduled to end by the year 1990, but extensions have been made to that date. One significant landmark was 20 December last year when Arthur Dunkel, the Director-General of GATT, advanced a detailed package of reform proposals to be used as a basis for negotiations to conclude the Uruguay Round. That as yet has not occurred. But, on 21 May this year, a modest but significant landmark decision came down in which Australia has a huge vested interest. I am referring to the fact that the Economic Community farm Ministers finally reached an agreement on a reform program for the common agricultural policy. That costs something like $50 billion to $60 billion in the EC alone; it is crippling the taxpayers over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight a few of the measures in that decision, there is a proposal for a 29 per cent reduction in the level of current grain support price over three years, from 1993 to 1996, which will bring the per tonne subsidy down from $A263 to $A186. Individual farmers will be compensated for this loss of income through direct payments if 15 per cent of their land is set aside from production. There will also be a 15 per cent reduction in the support prices for beef over three years, and the beef industry over there will benefit from the lower grain prices, which will partly offset that. It is also proposed that there be a 5 per cent reduction in butter prices over two years, and they have undertaken to review the quota levels for milk. Naturally, the farmers in the EC, particularly in Germany and France, have protested at these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I think the changes are incredibly modest, but they are a start, even though they fall well short of the Dunkel proposals. I acknowledge that there are many qualifications to those proposals that have been put forward. For example, 20 per cent of the growers in the EC produce 80 per cent of the grain, and many of those will still find it profitable to produce grain beyond the subsidy quota. The 15 per cent set-aside land proposal has many anomalies to it. That land can remain in rotation, it would allow farmers to concentrate their efforts on the farmed areas and would also allow the farmers to drop out 15 per cent of their poorest land. So we are not going to see a 15 per cent reduction in grain production, unfortunately. Of course, when we throw in the increases in productivity that take place through research every year, it will keep EC wheat production near the 100 million tonnes anyhow. On top of that, producers who farm less than 20 hectares are going to be exempt, and that is about 25 per cent of the land used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these are very modest gains indeed. Nevertheless, my excitement stems not so much from what the proposals will bring to us directly, but what they will bring to us indirectly through this being the foot in the door, the crack to open up the EC protection levels and destroy them. If EC protection were cut entirely, it is calculated that wheat prices would increase by 37 per cent, coarse grain prices by 26 per cent, sugar by 53 per cent, beef and sheep meats by 21 per cent and dairy products by 65 per cent. That alone would double the net profits for Australian farmers. So we can be pleased indeed that we have made a start in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these EC proposals, and what evolves from them, now be set in the GATT proposals and that other countries such as the United States be pressured to match and surpass these wind-backs as well. The United States has a lot of protection levels which affect us. The meat import law is one that is affecting us at the moment, and that has been triggered in four of the last six years. I believe that, if the US calculated what it cost, it would find that processors and retailers are many millions of dollars out as a result. That only means that Australian meat has to be diverted to the north Asian market, which is the biggest growth area for US exported meat anyhow. So, if the US wiped this silly law, it would benefit and we would too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grant that the United States has tried to reason with the EC for years in order to persuade it to lower its protection levels, and that has so far fallen on deaf ears. So America has now taken the approach that it feels it has to match the EC protection levels by fighting fire with fire and destroying the EC economically. However this measure is now spilling over into non-subsidised markets; it is becoming entrenched and it is certainly hurting us, particularly in the wheat industry. I believe that this madness must be wound back and that we must all recognise the principle that, when countries set out to harm other countries to their own advantage, it ends up harming themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, though, that we must be very patient with what  is being achieved, because even small gains can become very significant. For example, if EC beef levels had been maintained at 1978 prices, which was a high base year, the wind back in beef production, little though it was, and the increase in consumption through the lower prices, would have meant that the EC, through the decade of the 1980s, would have been a net importer rather than a net exporter of beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in conclusion, I urge all honourable members to keep up pressure through GATT to free up world trade through the Uruguay Round and the Cairns Group of trading nations and I welcome the progress that has so far occurred in this area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and indeed second the motion. This motion of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) on tariff reform is indeed an appropriate motion.

As I will point out shortly, it seems strangely incongruous to me, I must say, that a member of the National Party should be moving a motion such as this in the face of previous utterances by other members of that Party on this very issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, not wanting to detract from this sensible motion, I certainly support it, and I will briefly speak on some of the difficulties that I believe we have at the moment in convincing America to play ball properly. I will then deal with some of the inconsistencies that I have previously referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I speak about America, I must say that the decision by the EC Agricultural Council to begin the long awaited process of reform of CAP&mdash;or common agricultural policy&mdash;is most welcome and overdue, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes, said. Having said that, I think we would all agree that the EC still has a very long way to go and that many of the structural problems with CAP still exist. Unfortunately, some of the excessive uses of export subsidies still exist and the potential for the overproduction and accumulation of stocks in some commodities certainly still exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has previously said, the changes adopted on grains are a bit more encouraging and we all look forward to a reduction in the EC's use of export subsidies and the scale of those subsidies. So the signs from Europe are positive and welcome, but let us not get overjoyed; we have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Americans? In March of this year I had the privilege of leading an all-party delegation to the United States of America. The delegation was jointly sponsored by the Australian Political Exchange Committee and the American Council of Young Political Leaders. It was an extraordinary experience, I might say, and whilst I do not intend canvassing all aspects of that delegation here, some of the meetings we undertook in America were extremely relevant to today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As young students being brought up in a fairly conservative Australia, we were told that the United States of America was our friend and ally and that it would do nothing to harm us and indeed would protect us in the face of all evil. I guess that, as we grow older and wiser, we realise that all is not as it seems, and after leading the all-party delegation to the United States I am now sure that all is not as it seems or as we would like it to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In America the delegation had access to some of the most senior advisers to both President Bush and the Governor of California. We also met with numerous senators and congressmen and had the opportunity to press home the necessity for the United States&mdash;all countries, for that matter&mdash;to lower its tariff barriers and embark upon a fair dinkum, more level playing field mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that Australia, as a net exporter of primary produce, have access to overseas markets to retain the viability of its primary sector. At every opportunity, the delegation stressed the importance of the USA export enhancement program being more specifically targeted at the Europeans, whom it was supposedly set up to combat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also pointed out that the US export subsidies had damaged the volume and value of Australian farm exports, in particular grain, over the past several years. We stressed the point at every available opportunity that many of the USA domestic farm programs which supported domestic producers in the states prevented the access of Australian products to the US markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally met with the American Sugar Beet Growers Association in Washington. I advised the Association that the current US policy of restricting access to its markets by Australian producers was not only unfair but also totally inappropriate. We told anyone who wanted to listen that the restriction of beef imports from Australia also was iniquitous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Australians were brought up to believe that the USA was our friend and ally. I have to report that, as a result of the meetings the delegation had in the United States, particularly on the all-important trade issues, I am no longer so certain. Having said that, I would not want to portray the Americans as other than the most hospitable and friendly hosts any of the delegation members had come across, but on trade matters it seemed a totally different kettle of fish. Whilst most advisers, senators, congressmen and bureaucrats gave us a good hearing, they made it quite clear, in effect, that Australia was a small fish, that the USA economy was all important, and that whatever had to be done to protect US jobs and industries would be done. This was said almost as a short term solution to pacify a growing anti-incumbency feeling in America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made to us that people like Pat Buchannan and Jerry Brown were touching a chord with the average American by claiming that the USA had to continue to put up the barriers to protect its internal producers. Most agreed that this was no long term solution, nor one that would open up markets for USA producers, but it was perhaps a political short term stance that could well be adopted in the lead-up to this year's presidential election. In other words, the message was fairly blunt: `We understand that you Aussies are hurting due to EEP; we understand that tariffs should be lowered around the world to free up markets; but, come on guys, this is an election year. You do not really think that we are going to reduce protection to our farmers when we need them to vote for us in a few short months'. Well, United States of America, I say to you, `Get fair dinkum. Do not be like the National Party of this country that says one thing but does the other. Stop the rhetoric and put your words into action'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has played a huge role in the Uruguay Round of GATT. Its role has not really been in proportion to the size of its economy, but it has to be said that its role has been vital. It is almost as though, regardless of what other countries do, we have to press on to get those trade barriers reduced. We have to lead by example. If we do not, our exporters are really dead in the water. In supporting this motion, I repeat: America, you are not playing your part appropriately. Open up your markets and allow your consumers to have access to lower priced, better quality Australian primary products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the USA should stop resembling the National Party by saying one thing and doing another. I also said at the outset that it is quite extraordinary that this motion comes from a member of the National Party. That Party has been the most divided in recent history on this issue. Whether it be State or Federal members of the National Party, they have not been able to get their act together or show any consistency at all on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a brief look at what some of these National Party members have had to say on the tariff issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring the House's attention to the European side of this argument. The Europeans have subsidised their farmers to the extent of $US59 billion. The magnitude of that figure indicates the distortion which takes place in world agriculture. The industrial might of the Europeans has been able to generate that sort of wealth and allocate it to the farmers of Europe. It goes back to the situation after World War II, when Europeans can remember hunger. They remember that their families were unable to be fed, and from that basis they wanted to make Europe self-sufficient. That was a desirable policy in itself and, of course, in the 1950s and 1960s they were able to achieve self-sufficiency. During that time, there were 30 million farmers and they were able to cultivate the land, increase their productivity and bring about massive agricultural production in Europe. Now there are only eight million farmers achieving this massive output, along with the subsidy of about $US59 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1970s and the 1980s, self-sufficiency was gained and, of course, the excess was sent to the world markets without any real signals of the prices that farmers should receive. The mechanisms had been set up, the farmers continued to produce and, of course, the excess was placed on world markets, much to the disadvantage of the Americans and the Australian farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European consumer in 1960 paid about 45 per cent of the household budget on foodstuffs. So, again, they had a vested interest in good quality food on their tables. Now, in 1992, they pay about 18 per cent of their household budget on food products. Again, they are not very sensitive to the price movements of food. They are interested only in a quality product being available and they are not too worried about the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The USA has allocated $900m to its export enhancement program, of which 84 per cent goes into wheat sales. As the honourable member for Kennedy quite rightly said in this Parliament, we have a situation where America, on the one hand, suggests that its enhancement program will pull the Europeans into gear and, on the other hand, it says to the delegation of which he was a member that it needs to protect its home producers at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with him that the American farmers are having two bob each way. On the one hand, because of the sensitive political nature of the Midwest, they wish to support their wheat farmers and their grain growers, but on the other hand they move around the world suggesting that the export enhancement program will force the Europeans into a lower subsidy situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Europeans have, in recent times, indicated a willingness to reduce subsidies. That is to be applauded. We support that move. However, in recent days we have seen the French farmers moving in on Paris, yet again, blocking the arterial roads and saying, `Under no circumstances will we allow the Europeans to reach a sensible, rational solution'. The key element in the European situation is that the grain price is subsidised by the Americans on the one hand via their enhancement program, and on the other hand subsidised by governments all over Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are intensive industries in Europe that are enjoying this cheap grain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point to consider will be these environmental problems that Europeans will be facing. That will be the political impact that will bring about change in Europe. Their waterways, their soils, and the pesticides and fertilisers they use will be the key elements in the politics of those 340 million people living in Europe that will bring about change in the European Common Agricultural Policy.

Like the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), I too have been fortunate in having been to Washington and Europe on trade discussions. But we needed a benchmark, somewhere to start from in regards to trade, and finally the Europeans have given us that benchmark. As the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has said, the hypocrisy of the French farmers complaining about giving up concessions is absolutely ridiculous and is just a political ruse on their part. The fact is we now have a benchmark and a position to work from. The major strategy we are following is to get European tariffs made clear so that we know exactly what sort of protection levels and tariff levels they have. That has been the importance of the Dunkel proposal and the GATT rounds that have now got to a stage where hopefully the G7 nations will make their mark and set it in concrete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of this motion is urging the United States to do the right thing. I am disappointed too, as all the previous speakers were, that our ally the United States has been reluctant to liberalise trade. I say that because if one looks at every great conflict the world has ever seen, and if one quarantines religion, then the only other issue that has caused conflict has been trade. Every conflict has basically been fought over trade and access to trade. The two leading economic powers in the world, the European bloc of nations that gave us the Reformation, and the United States that gave us a great political institution, should know better than to lock themselves up behind walls of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the running mate of Cox, I think it was, in the 1920 US presidential campaign, he criticised protection, yet the measures that Franklin Roosevelt introduced, probably correctly, as wartime measures during World War II are still embraced by the present US Congress and the US Administration. I think that is a sad indictment of a nation that has been visionary in so many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Europeans have started to move, they have not moved far enough, to our way of thinking. What does make it difficult is that when we go back to our own constituencies and tell our farmers that we are going down the right track, and it is the right track, we have to look them in the face and know that they are missing out on revenue they are entitled to, that some of them are losing their properties, because of the corruptness of world trade. It is very hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the selfishness that has been exhibited in the past is unbelievable and I would sincerely hope that the United States does move in the right direction. As the honourable member for Corangamite said, there is always the excuse that there is an election coming up. In America there is an election every two years, whether it be the Senate or congressional election or the presidential election. It has always been the weak excuse; what really is lacking in America is political courage. It is ironical that that country just does not have that courage. It knows as well as we do that every time it plays its game to get access to its own markets for its own farmers, or so it says, it is affecting us, an ally and a country that does not interfere in world trade, a country that simply wants a fair go to sell our own products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the Europeans, a legitimate excuse in the past has been the need for food production because of the hunger of World War II. But World War II was brought about because of a trade war that started in World War I, which actually started in the Franco-Prussian War. The fact is that Europeans know better than anyone else that corruption of trade is the reason why they starved and why their cities were bombed and why they fought each other. They should know better than anyone else that their behaviour is not conducive to a civilised world. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)congratulates the ABC on the high quality of its television and radio services in the fields of news and current affairs, entertainment, education and cultural programming; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the Government to ensure that the resources of the ABC are steadily increased so as to enable it to extend and improve its services to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>As an unabashed, long term, committed ABC listener and viewer, I am delighted to be able to move this motion today. Surely, even those who have felt the occasional sting of Auntie's vigorous journalism or her satirical tongue, or who have been critical of some of her attempts to test the boundaries of public broadcasting, would not shrink from joining in the congratulations for 60 years of outstanding broadcasting achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has been absolutely fundamental to the development and appreciation of all strands of our culture. For most of those past 60 years, it has been the one genuine national information and entertainment link for our far-flung cities, provincial centres, country towns and tiny isolated outposts. From the early pioneering radio days, the ABC has grown into an extraordinary service which incorporates a national television service carried on nearly 500 transmitters, with production and transmission centres in all State capitals and Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has five main radio services across Australia. Apart from metropolitan and regional radio, there are the unique services of Radio National&mdash;innovative, provocative and informative&mdash;which are networked throughout Australia: ABC FM Stereo, a national network devoted to fine music; and JJJ, a youth network heard in every capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is Radio Australia, an international short-wave service, broadcasting over 50 hours of programs daily in English and several other languages. ABC Concerts, with six symphony orchestras employing nearly 500 musicians, gives more than 60 concerts a year live to more than 800,000 people. There is the ABC marketing operation, a relatively new adjunct, which has now grown to 14 ABC shops and more than 80 ABC centres, involved with the production of books, recordings, audio and video cassettes and the marketing of ABC facilities and program sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people over the years have whinged and carped about the public money that has gone into the ABC, but how do you measure the benefits, and how many other countries have been so well served by their public broadcaster, with such a healthy spirit of genuine independence? Very few indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For much of its history, the ABC has been the broadcasting pioneer in this country. It has had its high points and its lows, its quiet times as well as its turbulent times. At present, it is at a particularly high plateau of achievement. It has never been healthier and yet it has never been under so much threat&mdash;and I will say more about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me justify the claim that the ABC has been the outstanding pioneer in broadcasting and that it is enjoying peak performance at present. Many of our finest moments in broadcast comedy, in satire, in drama, in sporting coverage and, of course, in news and current affairs, have been initiated or produced on the ABC. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in its journalism. The ABC news network is incomparable in terms of both reach and credibility. The same goes for its international network of correspondents in major news centres of the world, whose value has been so brilliantly demonstrated over the past two years of historic and dramatic upheaval in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABC radio's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> programs have provided the benchmark for excellence in that medium since their birth 25 years ago. ABC television's two most remarkable current affairs programs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight</EMPHASIS>, have left an indelible mark across the face of the industry. Commercial television's first two forays into current affairs journalism grew from those two programs and their guiding influence remains today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> spawned a commercial offering in the Bob Raymond documentary series of the mid-1960s. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight</EMPHASIS> gave us a commercial hybrid in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. So many of the big names, the most credible names, the production backbone of programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sixty Minutes</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday,</EMPHASIS> came from the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has come through the tough times of the Fraser years in terms of both the attacks on its independence and savage budget cuts. Although Labor's tradition of support for the public broadcaster is unwavering, the ABC has been forced to take its share of the overall cuts in public spending in recent years. Yet the ABC has been able to not only survive but reach new heights and chalk up new milestones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1984, ABC TV has increased its annual telecast by over 2,100 hours, or more than 40 per cent. In the same period it has maintained its level of Australian content at more than 50 per cent, and it has also increased ABC made program content by over 1,300 hours, or nearly 50 per cent. During those years, drama production has risen by 138 per cent, from 48 to 113 hours. Since 1986 TV news and current affairs bulletins have been considerably strengthened. Innovation continues with programs of the calibre of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Correspondent</EMPHASIS>. The ABC now has 25 correspondents and five stringers in 22 locations throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 ABC television and radio won 23 international awards and 22 national awards for excellence. In 1991 the ABC won 35 national awards, including eight Walkley awards and five Logies. In this year's Logie awards, traditionally a commercial domain, the ABC virtually scooped the pool in drama, current affairs and documentary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the unarguable worth of the national broadcaster's unprecedented breadth of output, the Opposition threatens to decimate the ABC. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), have left no doubt that the ABC is squarely in their sights. Last week the Leader of the Opposition opened a business lunch in Brisbane by warning the MC, Andrew Olle, that the ABC will soon need to draw on all its marketing skills. The shadow Minister has released a background paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Broadcasting in Australia; a Need for Change?</EMPHASIS>. He has foreshadowed a cut of 10 per cent, or more than $50m, in the ABC's funding. He plans to force the ABC into program sponsorship as part of a Liberal reform package that could cripple the Corporation. And do not forget the goods and services tax. That would be an extra impost additional to the cuts. The GST could cost the organisation as much as $20m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He argues that there is less rationale for the Government to fund the ABC if it continues to pursue a wider audience. The would-be Minister tries to dress up the attack on the ABC as some sort of justifiable exercise. But he underscores cynicism by his treatment of symphony orchestras. He would sell off five of the six orchestras, keeping only the orchestra based in Tasmania: guess where the shadow Minister comes from. The honourable member for Bass is all about regionalism. He attacks the bogey of centralism in the ABC, yet most of the ABC's finest product over decades has been its national programming. He is not talking about an intelligent service to regional Australia. He is talking about breaking the back of the national broadcaster, which he and his conservative colleagues have come to hate, breaking its independent spirit and reducing it to a haven for parochial mediocrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that by slashing $50m plus from its budget&mdash;that is the only cut that the Opposition is prepared to acknowledge at this stage&mdash;the shadow Minister for parochialism would undermine his own desire to expand the ABC's regional emphasis. As the ABC Chairman, Mark Armstrong, points out, the proposed cuts would spell the end of State based production of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, local news and sport, and significantly reduce other local and regional programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated his inability to handle criticism. He hates it. He is so ideologically driven that he genuinely believes that anyone who questions his misguided and dangerous plans for this country must be some kind of left wing subversive. Labor has been bruised by some of the ABC's more robust reports. At times some of those arrows have been unfairly fired: no-one is perfect. But in the end we have copped it because, overwhelmingly, we believe that it is a fundamental tenet of a healthy democracy&mdash;of this healthy democracy&mdash;that the independence and integrity of the national broadcaster has to be protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 July 1932 at 8 p.m., the words went out from the Sydney GPO over the radio waves, `This is the Australian Broadcasting Commission'. That was the start of the ABC back in 1932. Later, it became known as the ABC and the call sign became, `This is the ABC'. The title `ABC' was originally reserved by a radio station, the Australian Broadcasting Company, that commenced prior to 1932 and was not connected with the government broadcaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, Mr Joseph Lyons, said in the opening broadcast from Canberra that the ABC would provide information and entertainment, culture and gaiety. Mr Scullin, the Leader of the Opposition, said that the ABC&mdash;this was a bit more sinister&mdash;must not be an instrument for subversion or misrepresentation. He was very cautious about endorsing the ABC, whereas the Prime Minister of the day said it would serve all sections and satisfy the diverse tastes of the public. Mr Page from the Country Party&mdash;as the National Party was then known&mdash;said that having radio broadcasting in cities was a luxury but in country areas it was a necessity, and he gave it strong endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When reading the 60-year history of the ABC one becomes compelled to consider the personalities and the people involved in this organisation. It is people and their talents, abilities, inventiveness and capacity to provide a service to all of Australia that attract one's attention. One notes also the programming changes that have occurred over the years. In the early days the need was to provide an alternative outlet for culture and drama. Radio plays figured highly in the early days of the ABC. The Saturday and Sunday evening programs and the traditions of the ABC&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Lawsons</EMPHASIS>, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bellbird</EMPHASIS> when it was televised&mdash;served as a link across Australia for drama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With music, in the early days of the dance bands there was Jim Gussy, and the ABC had two large dance bands. With orchestras, there was the conductor, Dean Dixon, and many names spring to mind when one thinks back about what the ABC has provided to Australia. It even had a military band, and I remember as a child hearing a singing group called the Village Glee Club, who used to sing regularly. All these have provided entertainment and cultural expression over the ABC. Concerts, artists, groups and personalities&mdash;that is what the ABC has been about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am afraid it was not pre-war. In fact, that format did not really start to change until television had an impact on radio. There were educational services, and some of these have recently been scrapped, which I think is tragic in many ways. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Let's Join In</EMPHASIS> was an early kindergarten of the air program. There were school broadcasts that were awaited anxiously by school children around Australia. They provided an interesting diversion from the teacher in front of the class and also provided a wider aspect of education that was not available in the country classroom, or the city classroom, for that matter. Gifted educators worked through the educational service of the ABC. The talks program by H.D. Black is one that I remember. A former Chancellor of Sydney University, he broadcast brilliant vignettes of current affairs and topics of interest to all Australians. Religious programs provided on Sundays a sought-after service for the elderly and those who lived in remote areas. Even some of those who were not church attenders used to wait on those religious programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the sports programs, the name of Alan McGilvray is legend in cricket in Australia. Talbot Duckmanton commenced his career in radio as a sport commentator. Norman May's name would have to be mentioned in the sports arena. The coverage of major events has brought a verbal description to all Australians of great events, of Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and royal visits. Martin Royal's name I remember here. He was sort of a neighbour of our family for many years. One of our commentators here in Canberra, Bruce Webster, is known for his coverage of major events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of television started to change the processes of radio. No longer was there the same need for description and eye and ear appeal as commentators endeavoured to describe what they saw happening at great events or at sporting events. There have been many changes to the ABC over that period of time, but I am told that the major innovations that have dramatically affected the ABC and all broadcasting have been the advent of tape recording and satellite transmission. Both of these have allowed portability and on the spot coverage, whether it be by voice or to air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today those great studios where so many of these productions were launched are empty and there has been a loss, I feel, of those brilliant, talented people that produced programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Argonauts Club</EMPHASIS>, which went to young people and children right throughout Australia. There were many avid listeners at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. But things have changed. There is not nearly the same emphasis on providing cultural activity for Australians through the ABC as there used to be. Much of that talent has moved on. Much of the talent that Australia produced first had a chance for expression through the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the ABC has become a trading point for information services. News and current affairs tend to dominate all of the programming of most outlets and the ABC has not been unaffected by that. My colleague has mentioned some of the continuing activities which appear to be in decline, no matter what government is in office, because of the availability of television and the diversity that Australia is going to see in television and radio services with FM services, with cable and with pay television. There is a multiplicity of choices for the Australian consumer, and I think that is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are not mourning a past era; we are really paying tribute to 60 years of achievement in the ABC. The changes that are coming are going to be approached by this House in a number of different ways. Our side of the House wants to see an enlivened ABC, but we do not want to see an ABC dominated by ideologues or by people who are doing things because they have always been done that way. We do not want to see an ABC encumbered by a huge administration that restricts the talent and the expression that is still there in that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diversity, alone, that we are on the verge of seeing in Australia is going to produce big changes. There will be budgetary changes to the ABC. Despite the larrikin cockney who leads that organisation, and his attempts to settle his differences with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in a rather physical manner, the changes will occur and the ABC will need to adjust. But the easy thing for the ABC to do would be to cut popular programs and to retain the administration. Frankly, the community of Australia will not wear that; the community will switch to other channels; they will not care. What the ABC has to do is to win the argument on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say that, despite the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) about the value of current affairs programs on the ABC, I and others on this side of the House see in many instances just the wish to get a story, no matter whether the headline is right or not&mdash;the trading in half-truths that has become part of the current affairs news milieu, and is a significant blot on the presentation of news and information in Australia today. The ABC, in my view, has not been impartial in the way in which it has presented many of its news programs: it seems to curry favour with the government of the day. I do not see that that is a reason for change, though. Force of circumstance will bring about changes in the ABC that are inevitable. There will be sponsorship, and there will be greater commercialisation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take great pleasure in formally seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), and I commend him on his contribution to the debate. He has a long-standing, deep and personal commitment to the ABC, and that was reflected in his research and the content of what he had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be very brief in my remarks. I would just like to reinforce the honourable member's statement that, from the point of view of the Government, the ABC is regarded as a vital institution in this country, and it is to continue to be supported as an independently funded public broadcasting organisation. There is no question in my mind about the quality of product, the quality of program that goes to air&mdash;be it by television or radio&mdash;that emanates from the ABC. There is always a degree of controversy in some of its programs and that causes difficulty for us as politicians, but that does not cause us to back away from our basic commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I was out of Australia for a couple of weeks and had the opportunity to look at television services in North America, in particular. I would have to say that, even though there may be 20, 30, 40 or 50 television channels in some other countries, one has to do a lot of roaming around on the screen, with the remote control switch, to find anything that gets anywhere near the standard of television services provided in Australia, both on free-to-air TV and particularly on the ABC. Australians who are fortunate enough to have had the chance to make that comparison need to understand that. In any consideration like this, I think we must also acknowledge the role of the ABC as the national communicator, not only within Australia but also on the international front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is no coincidence that a number of our near neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, from China through to Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia&mdash;countries which have regularly received Radio Australia over the years&mdash;are now looking for English language programming. They are adopting, as national policy, English as a second language. They are looking to their populations to adopt English learning, English programming and English content. Almost as one those countries and those governments are looking to Australia as a major provider of that programming, which is part of the motivation behind the great pay TV debate in Australia. It is no coincidence that that English language programming, being sought from here, has been stimulated by Radio Australia broadcasts into the region over a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was going through those moments of nostalgia he, of course, caused us all to recall those great moments in our own lives when the ABC was particularly important&mdash;and it will continue to be so. This is not a funeral for the ABC, it is a celebration of 60 years of national broadcasting, and we are looking forward to many more years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall quite vividly in 1982 when the Ash Wednesday bushfires devastated both the eastern and western sides of Melbourne. Communications between the emergency services broke down and nobody knew what was going on anywhere. In that instance people finished up listening to Radio 3LO, the major ABC station in Melbourne, to get progress reports. People phoned in where they were and they phoned in their telephone numbers so that their relatives could find out how they were faring. It was a vital service that had broken down elsewhere in the Victorian community, so the ABC finished up providing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember seeing my first invigorating British television program, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Steptoe and Son</EMPHASIS>, on the ABC. I have always liked the humour that the ABC has brought to us in television. What young boy will ever forget the tied test in Brisbane, and Alan McGilvray's dulcet tones bringing descriptions to us in our backyard shed. Whether it is free to air television, whether it is pay television or whether it is radio, the ABC does have a special place in all our lives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in this afternoon's debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). It is appropriate that the House debate this issue as the ABC has played and continues to play a very significant role in the political, social and cultural life of Australia. Paragraph (1) of the motion before the House is deserving of support. While I cannot say that I have always been satisfied with the political slant of the ABC news and current affairs shows, I will say that overall the ABC has given its viewers and its listeners a comprehensive news and current affairs service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been times when the ABC has been very wrong in its handling of certain issues and events. In this regard the Gulf War in 1991 comes readily to mind. I remind honourable members of the criticism levelled at the ABC by both the Government and the Opposition during the Gulf War and I remind the House of the words of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who said on 23 January 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it difficult to summon the language to describe my contempt for their analysis by so-called experts.</PARA>
<PARA>With these reservations stated, I am still willing to agree with the sentiments expressed in paragraph (1) of the motion before the House. In particular, I would like to congratulate the ABC's many initiatives in the area of drama, comedy, classical music, ballet, education and sport to mention just a few. There is no doubt that the ABC's television and radio services have offered Australians a variety of programs that commercial networks could not and would not contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to paragraph (2) of the motion I must state that I have a very different view to that of the honourable member for Fraser. Indeed, the coalition Fightback package has detailed plans for the funding and administration of the ABC under a Hewson Government. This year the ABC received $562m from parliamentary appropriations. In addition it received free of charge $113m for transmission services from DOTAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a coalition Government the ABC would be subjected to a 10 per cent funding cut as part of the overall program of reducing government expenditure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in today's grievance debate about a very important and serious issue affecting my constituents and people generally living in the southern area of Sydney. I am referring to the recent legislation which passed through this Parliament enabling the Australian Nuclear Scientific and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, to temporarily store nuclear waste at the Lucas Heights site in the Sutherland Shire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we come to an end of this autumn sitting, I want to reiterate my overriding concern for the environment, particularly in that beautiful area of Sydney which I represent. The Sutherland Shire is a unique part of Sydney with no less than 10 natural sites listed on the National Estate Register and is home to more than 191,000 people. It was with caution and careful consideration that I supported the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Bill 1992 in this place on 4 May, and again yesterday. I have supported that Bill and its amendments on two key principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there had to be a concrete assurance that the Lucas Heights site would in no way become a de facto national permanent repository for nuclear waste in this country. Had there been any suggestion that this would have in fact occurred, I would have opposed the Bill outright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, during the long association I have had with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, and its predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, AAEC, I have come to value their expertise in these matters greatly. I was first elected to represent this area of Sydney 26 years ago and have had numerous dealings with ANSTO and AAEC over that time. I am convinced that ANSTO is properly equipped to employ the necessary environmental safeguards associated with dealing with radioactive waste to ensure the safety of the community living in the Sutherland Shire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my discussions with the various authorities since February, when the original court decision was announced, I was satisfied that the original Bill took account of these concerns. Therefore, I supported the ANSTO Bill in this House based on those principles. The court action brought by the Sutherland Shire Council against ANSTO earlier this year was, of course, the reason behind the need for such legislation. I want to make it patently clear that at no time during this action was safety considered to be an issue in the ruling of Justice Cripps. He accepted that Lucas Heights Research Laboratories is presently the safest site in Australia for the storage of radioactive waste. Justice Cripps said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also conceded that ANSTO has special expertise and skill in handling and storing of radioactive wastes and that although radioactive wastes are stored elsewhere in Australia, for example, St Marys, there is no other place in Australia where such wastes can be stored as efficiently and safely as on the land at Lucas Heights under the supervision of ANSTO.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Cripps's observations confirm my long held belief that ANSTO is Australia's premier scientific body equipped to deal with radioactive material. This is not to suggest, however, that the ANSTO premises at Lucas Heights should be used as a permanent repository for nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO is the major nuclear research facility in this country able to deal with radioactive material. Through my association with ANSTO over the past 26 years, first as the member for Hughes and subsequently as the member for the neighbouring electorate of Cook, I am aware that it possesses the proper ventilation and water cooling systems required for the treatment of radioactive waste. It is presently implementing a program of reforms following the recommendations on radioactive waste management by a Canadian atomic energy company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to add that ANSTO also possesses the necessary emergency equipment in the unlikely event that an accident may occur. This assessment, of course, does not mean that the Lucas Heights site is without its problems. However, on balance, and in accordance with the remarks of Justice Cripps, the expertise of ANSTO is not doubted. This situation then begs the question: if not Lucas Heights, where else? Certainly the St Marys site was recognised as being less safe than Lucas Heights for the storage of this material. Justice Cripps recognised this very fact but determined that the breach of the New South Wales planning laws weighed heavier in his decision. The fact remains that Lucas Heights Research Laboratories exists as the safest storage area for such waste until a permanent national repository site is found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These points need to be remembered, given ANSTO's expertise in the handling of nuclear waste and the lack of a permanent site for this material. The only logical conclusion was to temporarily store the waste at Lucas Heights. That was the sum effect of the legislation which we debated in this House. It facilitated the continuation of the arrangement between Australian Defence Industries and ANSTO and consolidated ANSTO's position as Australia's leading organisation dealing with radioactive material, as I have stated. Had there been any suggestion that the legislation went beyond those terms to allow Lucas Heights to become permanent nuclear waste repository, I would have opposed this Bill outright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had this confirmation from the Minister in a new section which was inserted in clause 4 of the ANSTO Bill yesterday. I am pleased that the Senate agreed to this amendment from the Government. Hopefully, the amended Bill incorporating this assurance will allay any fears that people, in particular residents in the Sutherland Shire, may have had about Lucas Heights becoming a permanent national repository. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate members of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for proposing that such a concrete assurance be enshrined in the legislation. I equally commend the Minister for his compliance. While I believe that the original legislation was to the same effect, that there was no intention by the Government to make Lucas Heights a permanent repository, I can see that the legislation now strengthens that commitment. The coalition is adamant that under no circumstances would Lucas Heights serve this permanent purpose. It is a nonsense even to suggest such a thing. About 52,000 people live within the Lucas Heights vicinity and, with planned housing in the area, this number is soon expected to reach 75,000. In one of the fastest growing areas of Sydney, it is lunacy to propose that Lucas Heights should become a permanent national repository for national waste. Such a proposal, might I say, would never have my support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole issue only serves to illustrate the urgency of the need for a national permanent site for radioactive substances. Presently there is approximately 3,400 tonnes of nuclear waste held throughout Australia and this volume is growing by about 100 tonnes a year. This is clearly an unacceptable situation and the process for finding a suitable site has taken far too long. I call upon the Government to expedite the selection process, although I acknowledge the Minister for Primary Industry's announcement earlier this month that his Department and the Bureau of Mineral Resources were conducting a study to find a suitable site. I understand that there is a report to be issued in three months time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been calling for a national site for some time because we have always recognised the seriousness and urgency of this matter. We have called on the Government to establish a nationwide audit of the country's waste dumps to determine the actual state of the nuclear waste stored in 26 or so dumps around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some degree of hope that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) announced an invitation last week to the New South Wales Government for ANSTO to help in assessing the current state of radioactive sites in my State. This is in response to an inspection by Environment Protection Authority officers at ANSTO's Lucas Heights site last week. This inspection revealed only minor defects, which would definitely not constitute a public health risk. We are at last getting some action from this Government regarding the storage of nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia urgently needs a coordinated national strategy on nuclear waste, as the Lucas Heights incident clearly illustrates. That the Lucas Heights site would become a national permanent repository site was, in my view, never an issue and such a move would never receive my support or endorsement. Following the Senate's inquiry and subsequent amendments to the legislation, we now have ministerial assurance that such a course would never eventuate, and I hope this assurance allays any fears that residents in the Sutherland Shire may have had previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reaffirm my support of ANSTO in its endeavours to provide adequate service in the treatment of radioactive waste and my firm commitment that the Lucas Heights site should never become a permanent storage area for nuclear substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the two minutes remaining to me, I want to say that I am absolutely shocked by the unemployment figures which are being released from my area of Sydney. Despite all the bleatings or whatever word one cares to use to describe the claims from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the unemployment figures are not what they seem or are not that percentage or this percentage, the fact remains that in the two social security offices in my area the figures are very bad. In the Caringbah office, unemployment has moved from 563 in May 1990 to 2,221 this year, a 294 per cent increase. In Sutherland, which services my electorate, the figures are just as bad, from 634 in May 1990 to 2,110, a rise of 233 per cent. This does not involve any very big industry; it is across the board unemployment that has created a huge problem in what people regard as an affluent and safe suburb. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the Endeavour Foundation. I do so because of the unprecedented attacks made on me in the name of the Foundation by its very highly paid chief bureaucrat, Mr Tom Barry. Mr Barry issued his open statement on 4 June 1992, even though he was aware of attempts being made for discussions to take place between Mr Barry and me. These discussions took place on Monday last, 21 June 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first to acknowledge the history of the Foundation and the work and dedication involved in its birth and early struggles, and the continued work by a number of parents of the disabled and, subsequently, by many unpaid helpers and supporters. These gallant Queensland volunteers should not be confused in my remarks with the plutocratic Tom Barry and his highly paid executive staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As society has matured, it has developed a much more sophisticated view of the role available in society for those children who do not fit the norm. They should not be hidden away in backrooms by bureaucrats&mdash;public or private&mdash;to be ripped off emotionally, physically and financially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 June 1992 I felt constrained to raise in the House the circumstances concerning a constituent of my electorate of Forde who was a client of Endeavour Foundation. Elizabeth Young of Woodridge is now a valued part time member of my office staff&mdash;but more of this later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very well-rewarded chief executive, Tom Barry, saw fit to distribute widely his six-page attack on me. It is not my intention to raise here the defamatory nature of Barry's commentary, but before proceeding to deal with the specific effort and evasion in the Barry statement, I would like to comment on his ignorant and ill-informed attack on parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us would concede that there is the occasional misuse of the Parliament, but if I might offer a little friendly lesson in basic civics to Endeavour's distinguished executive director, I would point out that parliamentary privilege is one bulwark of our democratic system. It ensures that issues of public importance are not hidden but very much see the light of day. It helps to protect the poor, the underprivileged and the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise that welfare organisations spend taxpayers' money and must do so responsibly. No amount of abuse or orchestrated smear will prevent me from pursuing alleged abuses, no matter how noble the cause, no matter in which special interest group or church&mdash;my own included&mdash;or in the name of which expert or executive director the abuse occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Forde electorate, welfare organisations are well aware of the level of probity the Federal member and voters require. They also know what vigorous support they will get if they are delivering real service to those of my constituents who are less fortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let us look at Mr Barry's fairytale story and compare it with the facts. The Keating Labor Government in the 1991-92 financial year provided Endeavour Foundation with $8,649,829 in direct subsidy, all provided by the taxpayer. Of this, $2,422,987 will be spent on administration. Other areas of welfare are quite properly obliged to submit themselves to rigorous examination, so what about Mr Barry? He will not tell how much his salary package is. Rumour has it that it is in the order of $100,000 plus. Surely, the public is entitled to know how much the chief executive gets when over $8m of its taxes is going to the organisation and approximately 28 per cent of that is being spent on administration. We must also remember that the clients of Endeavour are also assisted by the Federal Labor Government through the disability income support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we asked Mr Barry about his package. He refused. Then a press report gave an average of between $25,000 and $40,000 for Endeavour administrators&mdash;a deliberate obfuscation, the classic obscurity of averaging to hide specifics. Yesterday Mr Barry declared to me that `he had supplied it to the Department'. `If the Minister is prepared to release it, it would be appropriate', says the executive director. Yesterday, the Minister's Department in Brisbane wrote to me. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department received details of individual Endeavour Foundation employees' salaries in 1986 during a review, and because of the lapse of time these are therefore not current. The Department does not receive individual salaries information from Endeavour Foundation and therefore does not have current information on them.</PARA>
<PARA>Someone is being untruthful. Whom are we to believe, the Director of the Foundation or the Department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barry, though, has great delight in publicly announcing the income of Elizabeth Young, one of his disabled clients, over whom he weeps crocodile tears. She was officially advised by the Foundation that her wages were to be reduced to the princely sum of $15 per fortnight. That is $1.50 per day for working from 7.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. Elizabeth's salary package from Endeavour has been made public knowledge by the esteemed director, as is a whole range of salary scales, from the Prime Minister's to those of aged pensioners. Come on, Tom Barry; own up. Neither Elizabeth Young nor Mary Crawford spend $8,649,829 of taxpayers' money. Neither of us have heritage protected brass taps either. Why so shy? What is there to hide? One reason for reducing Elizabeth's salary from the grand total of $58 a fortnight to $15, according to Endeavour's letter of 24 April 1992, was a $14,453 overpayment `of client wages'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the matter is surely the question of why only one group of workers is asked to take a pay cut, yet the most highly paid people in the organisation are still maintaining their salary levels. Well may we ask: where is their cut of similar proportions? A simple equation might be direct funding from the Government plus welfare payments to workers on one hand equals maintenance of salaries to highly paid able-bodied workers. Is that the kind of just society we seek?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt by Endeavour's director to make the clients the meat in the sandwich in this discussion has been successful. Playing on the emotions of people is yet another game being played. Despite the personal attacks and the loss of valued friends, I will not desist from seeking the truth. I also have an emotional stake in these and many other questions. As stated previously, I admire, sympathise with and pray for all concerned in their efforts to assist and support people in their pursuit of human dignity and all that flows from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elizabeth Young refused to accept $15 per fortnight from Endeavour for assisting to produce services sold commercially by that organisation. The executive director reportedly got over $4,000 for the same amount of time at work. Does he get a car? After Mr Barry's reduction of her salary, it cost her to go to work. It is a case of the worker actually losing money to work to produce services sold commercially to maintain salaries of able-bodied executives. Elizabeth cannot perform at an award level standard, but from the moment she joined my staff on a part time basis her performance and range of duties improved out of sight. Tom Barry, you have a moral obligation to train your clients. It is the twenty-first century, not the nineteenth. You get public money to do that, and you are accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elizabeth Young is the tip of the iceberg. Her complaint is not the only one I have received about Endeavour from both clients and staff. Mr Barry may claim to have the support of the manager of the disability services program for the central area, but I can assure both that not all departmental staff are satisfied with Endeavour's performance. I may be bizarre and guilty of self-aggrandisement, but I can show Mr Barry my hardworking staff carrying out a social justice function way beyond the level of their pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday we will all be attending Elizabeth Young's birthday party. I will enjoy myself, as will she, in a workplace environment where her efforts to improve herself have borne fruit, and where the work of her labour is properly recognised and her self-esteem enhanced out of sight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to grieve on behalf of 1.7 million Australian school children of primary school age who are not receiving a balanced view of environmental matters through the courtesy of the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. This House is aware of the mistaken and misleading propaganda that surfaced in the World Environment Day kit distributed recently to schools. Not only was the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) forced to disown this kit at a public launch, but she has also written to all Australian schools asking that the kit be not used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These offensive kits should have been returned to the Department by way of postage paid envelopes or through an arrangement with the contractor, Kwikasair. I contacted 15 schools in my electorate of Corangamite yesterday and only two spokesmen for those schools said that they could recall the Minister's letter that disowned the kit. One of these schools has put the letter attached to the kit in its library. Most of the other schools indicated that some of the material in the kits had already been used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this has been repeated around Australia then thousands of copies of this school kit are still available to students in libraries. On the Jesuitical principle that, if one has a child influenced at seven then one has him or her influenced for life, then the children will forever be saying they cannot have a wooden desk because it requires cutting down a tree to provide the timber for that desk. How sad that comments such as these are being made simply because the other side of the argument has not even been presented to these children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers, the forest and car industries and others who are victims of this clever and subtle propaganda have only won a pyrrhic victory. I challenge the Minister to report to this Parliament as to what she is going to do about this environmental kit which she has distributed to all schools around Australia and which she has publicly disowned as presenting an unfair and biased picture of environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has said to me that it would cost $1,400 for me to have access to the 1,200 pages of documentation about the schools kit as a result of my freedom of information application. On the basis of cost I reduced my request because I cannot afford the $1,400. It is easy for the Minister to waste up to $180,000 of taxpayers' funds but she will not allow proper scrutiny of the way in which this decision was reached, even though the cost of having this done is less than one per cent of these misused funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another current project of the Minister is the production of two greenhouse booklets for which an initial print run of 100,000 is planned. Expressions of interest were called for by DASET in December last year and they had to be in by 31 December 1992. The Department originally suggested that one booklet for all primary school age children be produced. One tenderer, Blue Wren Enterprises of Portland, Victoria, suggested in its original tender that the Department consider printing two booklets for different age groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any coincidence that on 13 April 1992 the Department sent out a fax to this particular tenderer, and I expect others, asking for quotes for two booklets. The quotes now had to include not only the text but a list of activities for inclusion in the booklet since the Department apparently decided at some stage during the previous 2 1/2 months to use a graphic designer for the end stages of this new project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the following Wednesday, 22 April, the day after Easter Tuesday, the tenderers were expected to alter their specifications. They were given five working days to spend time and money on a new submission. Two weeks later the contract was awarded to a Victorian company, Vox Bandicoot, with Green Advertising of Canberra to be the graphic designer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This poor treatment of tenderers is bad, but even worse is the danger that the finished product may not present a balanced view of the so-called greenhouse effect.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful tenderer for the text and activities, Vox Bandicoot, seems to have quite a good record when it comes to presenting a balanced view, at least to date. I cannot say the same for Green Advertising as most educationalists do not seem to know of its skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greenhouse booklet may repeat the mistakes of the World Environment Day kit. Frank Devine said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 June when he was speaking about the World Environment Day kit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Give the World a Hand</EMPHASIS> is a crafty piece of brainwashing to which kids should not be exposed at all, let alone under the government imprimatur.</PARA>
<PARA>The kit's producer, Social Change Media, apparently believed that this environment day kit was a good way to pursue a hidden agenda. Social Change Media seemed to want to influence school children in the religion of environmentalism as practiced by the outspoken and over-the-top greenie, Canadian David Suzuki. It took four attempts between DASET and Social Change Media to get the school kits up to what the Department considered to be an acceptable standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that this kit could not stand up on its own merits as a balanced, educational critique. The farmers, the foresters and the car industries had good reason to be upset. Educational material must adopt a balanced view. Young children are impressionable, and there are other issues such as some parents being very concerned that they are teaching their offspring one thing and having what they consider to be soundly based views usurped in the classroom by written material in which many parents may have little confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's Environment Education Unit is viewed by some noted educators in this field as not having the necessary expertise to look at the scientific claims made in such a field as the alleged greenhouse effect. The Minister has a consultative council, but its members are to conduct a review of the departmental greenhouse education program in 1992-93. It is difficult to imagine them doing this satisfactorily if they have been involved in the day-to-day examination of particular departmental projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the then Environment Department was forced to withdraw 200,000 leaflets to schools on the greenhouse effect because the assertions in the leaflet about carbon dioxide emissions were shown to be incorrect. Has the Minister or her advisers in the Department made sure that the views of respected scientists such as the Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Richard Lindzen, are incorporated in the booklets before they go out to school children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Lindzen says that he can find no scientific basis for the global warming theories that are being promoted by such groups as the Amsterdam based Greenpeace. The financial viability of many green groups depends on the emergence of a new threat to mankind every few years. If it is not nuclear energy, then it has to be the so-called greenhouse effect. Global warming is possible according to many scientists, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with 700 eminent climatologists as its members is only willing to issue scenarios, rather than forecast what might happen. These global warming scenarios, the IPCC notes, could be consistent with normal climatic activity rather than some sort of greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister should bring forward a review of how the Department's educational programs are working. Australian taxpayers cannot afford another costly recall of this yet to be produced greenhouse activity booklet. The Minister must also review the procedures of her Department in dealing with consultants. It is not good enough to stipulate that tenderers submit a proposal by the end of the month and then hear nothing for 2 1/2 months. The tenderers should be given more than five working days over a holiday period to put in an altered submission. If a contract is then awarded only two weeks later, questions must be raised about the fairness of treatment of all contract hopefuls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Minister must consider what she has to hide with my freedom of information application for both the schools kit and the greenhouse activity booklet. With large amounts of public money having been spent on the first, and about to be spent on the second, the public has a right to know where and how the money is being spent. The Keating Government's Minister for publicity should operate on the principle that she and her Department of the Environment must not only be balanced, but be seen to be balanced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently in this chamber I defended Australian shearers. I made it very clear that I would name anybody who was in breach of the industrial award or, in other words, breaking the law. Consequently, I named a B.J. Hammonds of Charleville who was convicted of seven breaches of the award and who was facing a further 10 charges to be heard on 30 June in Charleville. On top of that, I also made the observation that, if it is good enough for us to support&mdash;and I do support&mdash;the process of buying Australian wool, it is good enough for Australian graziers in the wool industry to buy Australian labour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of doing that and supporting the industrial law of this country, I have been attacked and criticised by Bill Bonthrone, the President of the United Graziers Association of Queensland, and W.J. Turner, who is the industrial officer for the Queensland United Graziers. I could not work out why they would attack me for defending the industrial law of this country and for being patriotic enough to stick up for Australian shearers, and why they defended B.J. Hammonds, who had in fact been in breach of seven awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has come to pass is that I have discovered that B.J. Hammonds's wife and a Graeme Haycroft have set up a partnership and formed what is called Troubleshooters, the same proposition that has existed in the construction industry. This is what Graeme Haycroft said in Charleville about his idea of subcontracting in the pastoral industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forget the 40 hour week, annual leave loading, overtime and award restrictions. By using shearers as subcontractors, they will earn a few cents more nett per sheep and the contractor can hire at the price he likes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Troubleshooters is all about&mdash;breaking down award conditions. I thought it was amazing that the President of Queensland United Graziers would support this proposition and attack me for simply supporting the industrial law of the land. Recently in a debate on State-wide ABC radio, Bill Bonthrone said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as we are concerned there are no shearers being paid below the award rate and the UGA certainly doesn't suggest or advise anyone that they should break the law. . .</PARA>
<PARA>He said twice more that he does not believe that anyone is being paid under the award rate. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there's no doubt that New Zealand shearers come over here with the aim to make some money, with the aim to work and work hard, so they would be going out of their way, without a doubt, to please, so they would be avoiding any hassles that they possibly could in the sheds and of course that's terribly important that people who are busy and struggling financially like that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine, providing they stick to the award and do the right thing. As President of the UGA, Mr Bonthrone should be aware that there are breaches of the award, even though they are very hard to find. Indeed, over the last 3 1/2 years in the Charleville area alone the Queensland shearing company Blue Shearing Services, the Queensland shearing company B.J. Hammonds, the Queensland shearing company Blue Shearing Services, William J. Harris, B.J. Hammonds, N. Parsons, B.J. Hammonds again, B. Crighton, W. Roberts, D. Jackson, S. Picone, F. Wolstenholme, A. Reilly, R. Munro, P. Lewis, F. Wolstenholme, R. Munro, I. East and B.J. Hammonds on 47 different occasions on various properties, some the same, have been found to be in breach of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have not all been prosecuted because on some occasions when they were found out they paid the money that was owing and things continued. On other occasions they were taken to court. On others it was found that there was no union labour there, and it is not necessarily the responsibility of a union to take up a case for non-union members. But what this indicates is that on 47 individual properties at different times over 3 1/2 years in the Charleville area, those people have been found to be in breach of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make clear that breaches of the award relate to underpaid rates, not receiving district allowance, full superannuation entitlements or travel allowance, no penalty rate for public holidays, substandard working and living conditions, and not working to award provisions. That is what breaching the award amounts to. As I said, I have been criticised by the President of the United Graziers Association of Queensland for defending the protection of conditions. He has denied something that everybody, even a six-year-old child, in western Queensland knows&mdash;that breaches of the award are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, B.J. Hammonds has been found guilty of breaching seven awards. He faces 10 more charges and, as I understand it, there will be six more summonses issued against him for breaching the award on 26 April 1992. Bruce Shearing is also facing another 30 summonses. Bruce Shearing has been charging $11 and $12 seven days a week to found employees who under the award should have their meals and cook provided. That is a rip-off of up to $84 per week per employee. He has also not paid fare allowance or district allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are clear indications that the awards are being breached. It is quite evident to anybody, even to someone like the President of the UGA, that it is happening. I do not mind his saying that it is not happening or shutting his eye to it, but what I take exception to is his attacking me for defending the law of this land and highlighting that there is in Queensland today, and right across the pastoral industry, an attempt to destroy the industrial system that we have. In being highlighted, the Bill Bonthrones of this world are supporting not only scab labour but practices that are not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take it one step further, I will quote from an Australian Taxation Office press release. Mr Jack Wheeler, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation at Chermside, has responded to an article appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS> of 4 June by saying that the contracts being offered by Troubleshooters Available, Charleville, do not release shearers from having pay as you earn tax deducted. He goes on to say that there is a clause within the Troubleshooters Available contract which directs that prescribed payments system tax be deducted. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is illegal as this type of taxation is only available between a payer and a payee within the same prescribed industry and Shearing is not an industry which falls within this category.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, illegal practices are taking place in the shearing industry. The President of the United Graziers Association is attacking me for defending the law and he is actually supporting a proposition that is illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind that he is politically on the other side of the fence, that he is a National Party supporter, but what I object to is being criticised by somebody when I support the law. It is quite clear that there is an attempt to break down award conditions and to use the situation where people are coming from New Zealand and looking for work as a pool of labour to break down established conditions that have been in existence in this country for 70 or 80 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, if the United Graziers Association is not prepared to sack Bill Bonthrone as its President, it does not do itself any service and it does not hold itself in very high regard. More importantly, I make the observation that the majority of Australian graziers do the right thing, but there are some who do not, and those who do not are breaking the law. I will not hesitate to name those people who break the law and rob workers, because I think it is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind being criticised by the likes of Bill Bonthrone and the National Party apologists, because nothing has changed in 100 years. The battling graziers missed out on drought relief because the greedy squatters rorted $30m in Queensland alone. We did not hear Bill Bonthrone say a word about that, because he was a National Party supporter. The people who are really running and controlling the UGA are the blokes that can be found with a National Party ticket in one pocket, a Qantas airline ticket in the other, getting in their Cessna and flying to Sydney to buy Country Road gear for their wives, and who are more at home in the members stand at Eagle Farm than they are out in the bush where the battling graziers and the workers are trying to help make the wool industry great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the height of the wool crisis, the United Graziers Association in Brisbane debated capital punishment. Is it any wonder that we do not have a broad enough value added industry in wool today when we have stupid leadership like the Bill Bonthrones of the United Graziers in Queensland? Unless he is sacked, the UGA will remain a National Party laughing-stock and will not be held in high esteem by people who support the award system and the industrial law of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sixty years ago this nation was in the grip of the worst depression since the 1890s. Today, Australians are again beset by the problems of unemployment, record bankruptcies, low levels of investment, and failing business confidence. However, in contrast to the 1930s, Australia has not followed the world into depression. This one has been entirely of our own making. More correctly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made it. It is the inevitable result not only of 20 years of socialism but of nearly 90 years of wage regulation and increasing trade union greed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. It is a nation whose people, when given the opportunity, are amongst the most ingenious and productive in the world. But in 1992 it has become a nation which has completely lost its way. It is a society captured by an unholy alliance between the leaders of a backward looking trade union movement clinging to a nineteenth century view of craft unionism and the obnoxious beard-stroking trendoids who now run the Australian Labor Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parlous state of the Australian economy is often compared to its state in previous postwar recessions. This comparison is entirely incorrect. If anything, the nation is in a more perilous position than it was in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Apart from the alarming level of national indebtedness and a decline in living standards that is both relative and absolute, Australians are increasingly burdened by the uncontrolled spending of governments, which was not evident in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current levels of unemployment constitute a national scandal. Equally scandalous, however, is our regulated labour market and the monopoly rents extracted by the thugs of the Swanston Street soviet. I will use the words of a former head of the Treasury:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system of wage determination today constitutes a crime against society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is. . . a system. . . under which trade union leaders and people preening themselves as `justices' of various arbitration benches combine to put young people in particular, but many others, out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been accomplices to that crime, our political `leaders' then come forward with expensive, incredibly bureaucratic and utterly inefficient `programmes' to gain votes by appearing to redress the consequences of their actions&mdash;or inactions&mdash;as the case may be.</PARA>
<PARA>On Unemployment Day last month, I was approached by a number of local citizens concerned about the critical unemployment situation, particularly youth unemployment. The meeting took place in my electorate office on 19 May with Mr Ian Boag, from the Frankston Council; Adrian Harris, from the Peninsula region; Terry Holman, from the Brotherhood of St Laurence; Vicky Martin, from the Citizens Advice Bureau; and Michael O'Mara, from the Salvation Army. They, like me, are appalled at the levels of unemployment. In my electorate of Dunkley, youth unemployment is officially 47 per cent but widely acknowledged to be over 60 per cent. This is a scandalous situation. What is more alarming, it is getting worse. The effects of this divisive social problem may well be more devastating to Australia than the impact of the two world wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government knows that, when it falls, its fall will be because of unemployment. Yet the initiatives so far have been almost negligible. What about releasing the resource projects currently held up by the bureaucracy and the lunatic greenies? What about an interest rate policy that will encourage savings and enable business to be internationally competitive? The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) know what has to be done on interest rates. They have mentioned it in this House. What about genuine enterprise agreements? What about training wages for youth? What about a taxation system that encourages effort? What about a migration system more attuned to the genuine interests of Australia than the requirements of the applicants? In fact, what about an industry policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the history of the two decades from 1972 to 1992 is written, many policy makers will be treated most harshly&mdash;and justifiably so. Those Menzies years so castigated by the Prime Minister saw unemployment at less than 2 per cent and inflation at similar levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government realises one thing: business investment and business confidence are at an all-time low. Most of the major architects of the problems remain protected from the consequences of their mindless, wealth destroying activities. I repeat my earlier assertion. The Canberra bureaucracy now has active business extermination departments that are as lethal as the gas ovens of the Third Reich. The reality is that the solutions to Australia's problems are not all that difficult. Even some honourable members opposite would admit that they know what must be done, but Labor has lost the will to act in the best interests of its traditional constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typical of what is happening is the LEAN computer system in Canberra. It leans on individuals for the most minor details of their private lives; it leans on the hapless taxpayer for huge sums of money; it leans on the security door to hide its sinister long term purpose; it leans on the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, so that every one of a person's personal details is recorded; it leans on police for surveillance information on individuals&mdash;useful, useless, true or false, it does not matter. It leans on legislators to protect its contents from all but 3,000 approved sets of bureaucratic eyes; it leans on legislators to protect the rights of those 3,000 sets of eyes. It leans against anybody who is hurt by the leaking of its contents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope to introduce a private member's Bill which, if enacted, would limit the contents of the LEAN database to the residents of Canberra. They thought of it. They can have it prying into their lives. It is no coincidence that the increasing intrusion of government into the lives of private citizens comes at a time when the legitimate activities of private business are under greater threat than ever before. Australians are now so overtaxed that the Prime Minister has ensured that many people refuse to save. He is now making saving compulsory with a superannuation levy which he will also tax. It is my belief that it is the individual responsibility of employees to negotiate superannuation with their employers as part of their package of remuneration. Employers should not be compelled or required to contribute any part of the employee's remuneration package to another party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of the Government's alleged objective of increasing national savings through compulsory superannuation&mdash;paid for by the employer&mdash;will not be achieved and, therefore, will not result in reduced reliance on age pensions. The Government's outrageous scheme is basically a transfer of funds from medium and small business to big business, on a scale never before seen in a Western economy. The superannuation money will be placed with the big funds, who rightly invest only in property and big business. The medium to small businesses which survive to pay the levy will contribute to the weekly transfer of $50m from that sector to the super funds. This amount will rise to some $200m per week if small business still provides half the jobs by the year 2002. Many say the levy will cost 100,000 jobs. However, it is my view that, based on the transfer of money, it will probably cost a million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is irresponsible and ludicrous for the Government to contemplate introducing the proposed levy at a time when every thinking person is painfully aware of the fragility of the economy. The introduction of the levy will see an increase in the inflation rate and a decrease in the nation's ability to compete in the marketplace. It will not be long before the whole of Australia will resemble the industrial hellhole of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister not only has to encourage new business, he also has to stop the existing ones from disappearing. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet have shown that they have no idea how business operates. They have no idea how and why businesses commence, how they grow and prosper, or what devastation he has delivered. Most businesses, if they survive, will need several years of being coaxed back to good economic health. A sudden burst of buoyancy would be far beyond their depleted financial resources. The Prime Minister cannot blame anybody else, including the previous Government, for what amounts to the deliberate destruction of so many of the nation's businesses and the resulting unemployment. For instance, youth unemployment has at least doubled since he took control of the levers. On a purely historical basis, if the artificially high retention rates in schools had not occurred youth unemployment would be about half a million. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) ought to start talking to some of the small businesses in his area. If he did he would find that the banks are the major problem because of the credit squeeze they have placed on small business across this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to banks and the issue of Bankcard. A campaign of deception and misinformation is being pursued by the banks, and I am calling on them to launch a national information campaign about Bankcard. We have heard so much from their spokespersons as to the money they are losing and how they are trying to give the customer a fair go, but the fact is that most people do not know what they are paying. I have talked to bank leaders in recent days in my own area and across Australia. I believe as many as two million Australians are paying what could be as much as $20m per month in penalty fees, simply through ignorance. These are penalty fees that the banks have kept a very close secret. They have not told people that if they do not pay by the due date, not only do they have to start paying an interest rate on the daily balance but they actually pay a one-off initial charge, equal to one month's interest, on the 25-day period they thought was interest free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the due date is the end of a month, there is supposed to be 25 free days in which to pay that account&mdash;25 days from the statement day&mdash;but the fact is that, if one does not pay by the due date, one does not start paying interest from there on; one goes back to the original statement date, 25 days before and one has to pay not a daily interest rate but one month's interest, which is, on average, 2 per cent of the balance that one has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can imagine that, at the moment, with some nine million credit card holders across this nation, that is, four million Bankcards, if only two million of them were not paying by the due date and if they owed only $500&mdash;and I am told the average is far more than that&mdash;they would all be paying a penalty fee of $10 per person per month. Just think about it for a moment. That comes to $20m per month of special penalty or $250m per year in penalties being applied by banks across this nation. That is the total when people owe only $500, and if only two million of them out of the nine million have not paid their account by the due date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took it upon myself to go to the banks in my own area and speak to banks elsewhere and ask their officials what is paid. They say that only a daily rate is paid. They did not know that there is a retrospective penalty on people who do not pay by the due date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they get their statement and see its due date, people believe that that means, provided they have paid into their local branch by that day, they will not pay any interest. That is not true. I have cases with the Commonwealth Bank where people have actually paid into branches without knowing that the fine print on page 8 of their booklet says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any payments made by you will not be treated as made until the dates on which the payments are actually credited to your Universal Card Account in the ordinary course of business.</PARA>
<PARA>So if one lives in a country town and one sends it by post&mdash;and Australia Post has got a few problems at the moment&mdash;it can take three or four days to get there, but if one walks into a local branch of the Commonwealth Bank and one pays it and it takes them three days to send that down, even though it has been paid into that branch, one is not free of interest, as one thinks one is. In fact, if the due date is on the 18th and that branch does not send it down until the 20th, not only is interest paid on those two days, a penalty interest rate is paid, back to the actual statement time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite disgusting; it is a distortion of what people believe; it is a blatant deception. It is misleading, and the banks ought to do something about it. People also know that if they take a cash advance&mdash;if they go in and get cash on their card&mdash;they pay interest immediately. People believe, however, that if they walk into Woolworths or Coles and buy groceries, they get an interest free period of up to 55 days&mdash;25 guaranteed, but up to 55. What they do not know is that, if they buy their groceries and are asked whether they want any money as they go through the checkout, and they take some cash, they automatically pay interest on their groceries as well. But people are not told that. The people do not know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give credit to the Martin inquiry for what it has done in trying to expose the practices and bring some information and understanding across this broad community. But despite that&mdash;and I went through the Martin report&mdash;there is no reference to this. There is no reference to what one has to pay on one's groceries if one gets cash. There is no reference to a 25-day retrospective period. There is no reference to a penalty&mdash;a penalty which is one twelfth of the annual interest rate applied to a 25-day period. There is no reference either to the fact that some people are privileged because they get gold cards and that all the banks have got them, and that if people are wealthy, they can get a lower interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reference to the fact that the banks are allowing certain customers to transfer moneys from one account to their Bankcard account before the interest becomes due. That is not readily known, but I now have the documentation to show where one can sign a form and the bank will do that before the due date. It is based on a statement date plus 25 days, and the statement date is one day after one actually get's one Bankcard account. So if one applies on 14 June, one's statement day becomes 15 June, and 25 days later is the due date. What people know is that they have a due date, so the wealthy, the smart, with the concurrence of the bank, sign a document and before that due day the bank pays it for them out of their account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That flies in the face of all the claims they have made of how they must charge interest. They have their own banking instrument, their own banking facility to allow certain people never to pay anything. They have a privileged position for some to pay a lower interest rate, but for the vast majority of people they pursue a campaign of ignorance, they mislead. They create a situation where, on the figures I have here, if only two million people do not pay on the due date and they pay a $10 penalty, that is $20m per month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the banking industry comes to the people of Australia and says that not only does it want to charge an interest rate, though it did not tell people about the retrospective penalty, but that it now wants to charge a special card fee of between $30 and $50 per year. If we work that out across nine million cards, we are talking about almost half a billion dollars per year, and now it wants a transaction fee on the customer as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is charging small business between one per cent and 5 per cent on everything people buy. That works out at something like 60 per cent interest on the small business person on a yearly basis. It is getting massive money from the business person as well, and now it has said publicly, as described in the Martin report, that it also wants this other fee. </PARA>

The Martin inquiry did marvellous things to awaken people to what was taking place, but we still have not got to that because the banks have kept it secret. There are banks out there which understand that they are under attack. There are banks which appreciate that even their own employees do not know what is going on. I went to the staff and asked `What is the situation? What do you pay?', and they did not know. When I got upstairs in one bank and I saw two of the top people there, I asked `Do you have a penalty charge?', and they said no. I asked them to pull out their little booklet and turn to page 24.

Thereafter the credit charge is calculated daily until the outstanding amount is payed in full'. They do not tell you what the penalty is; they do not tell you it is retrospective; they tell you nothing except that there is an initial charge. That initial charge could be $10, it could be $20, it could be $50 per person, depending upon the outstanding account on that due date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only a little over a year has passed since Mr Tony Fitzgerald brought down his report into the conservation and future management of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region. He recommended that Fraser Island and surrounding seas and some mainland areas totalling 844,000 hectares be made a regional park and nominated for World Heritage listing. The Goss Government has now rewarded Mr Fitzgerald for his quite extraordinary recommendations with a senior judicial post, while the people of the Fraser coast and Cooloola regions are left to pick up the pieces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, which had earlier bankrolled the conservationist case to the Fitzgerald inquiry, moved quickly to nominate an even larger area for the World Heritage list. Despite promises by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), the Queensland Premier and others that there would be extensive consultation prior to the nomination being made in October 1992, the Government suddenly changed its mind last August and rushed the necessary nominations to Paris, getting them in just hours before the 1 October deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is perhaps an element of justice in that the World Heritage Bureau is now apparently expressing serious reservations about aspects of the nomination. The Federal Government is desperately fighting a rearguard action to avoid another embarrassment in front of the World Heritage Bureau, and to salvage its Great Sandy Region nomination. It was always wrong to include in the nomination urban settlements such as Rainbow Beach and the Noosa north shore; quarries; areas that have been sandmined; or the Army's heavy artillery firing range, which has been bombarded for more than 30 years. If the Government had consulted with local people it would have known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government's mishandling of the Fraser Island affair does not end with the World Heritage nomination. The Commonwealth has committed $16m towards the $37.7m compensation package announced for the areas adversely affected by World Heritage listing. Indeed, the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, was widely reported as saying that the reason he wanted to have the area listed for World Heritage was to get Commonwealth funding for the compensation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the Minister for the Environment said, at the infamous taped meeting with conservation groups, that some Premiers would sell their mothers for a few bucks. While even this amount can only go a very small way towards compensating for the billion dollars of productivity lost to the nation by locking up the resources of the Great Sandy Region, $16m is still a considerable sum of taxpayers' money. Yet, the Federal Government seems to be prepared to take no responsibility for the way in which the money is being spent. Apparently, not wanting a repeat of the North Queensland wet tropics fiasco, where this Government presided over a compensation package heavily wasted and noted for its scandalous mismanagement and even misappropriation, this time the Commonwealth is trying to pass all accountability to the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions when I have asked questions on notice, seeking details of expenditure, the Minister for the Environment has declined to answer, saying that I should get the information from the Queensland Government. However, when my Queensland State colleagues ask similar questions in the Queensland Parliament, they are finding it just as hard to get information from the State Government; Ministers are covering up the facts with claims of confidentiality. The Queensland Treasurer said in State Parliament on 7 May that $22m of the $38m package could be spent by 30 June 1992. However, just $3m will be spent on job creation and worker assistance programs. Where is the rest of the compensation money being spent? Presumably some has gone to those businesses whose activities were destroyed, but how much, and to which ones?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to identify a single long term new productive job that has been created by this package. There are some social workers, State government promotional officers and extra public servants, but displaced timber workers have largely been shuffled into jobs previously done by others. When on 3 March 1992 I asked the Federal Minister for details of Commonwealth funds so far spent, I received headings totalling a little over $1.5m. The amount included $397,000, allegedly for Maryborough Heritage projects. That amount is presumably the same $397,000 that was reported in the Maryborough <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> as the first instalment of $1m. It was made up of $147,000 for work on Wharf Street, a project which was completed before the decision to nominate the area was even made; $150,000 towards the establishment of the Maryborough Bond Store Museum, where, despite an official opening, no work is so far apparent; and $100,000 to buy an old hotel as headquarters for the city's bitterly feuding Family Heritage Institute, which now may not be used for that purpose. </PARA>

However, these projects will not be employing displaced timber workers, and there is widespread concern in the Fraser Coast-Great Sandy Region, particularly outside Maryborough, that the compensation package has degenerated into a giant slush fund to prop up the electoral prospects of the State member for Maryborough, Mr Dollin, in his marginal electorate. </PARA>

What aid has been given to the Widgee Shire and the people of Gympie for losses to industries in that region? Where are their special projects&mdash;promotion officers, glossy brochures and the like? Or is it, as some are saying, that the Queensland Labor Government knows that it cannot win the State seats of Gympie and Hervey Bay and is using masses of taxpayers' money to help buy the marginal electorate of Maryborough?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now reported that the Government has paid $5m, or even $6m, to buy the Orchid Beach Resort on Fraser Island and that this purchase will be funded out of the compensation package. The closure of the Orchid Beach Resort does not compensate the people of the Fraser coast and Cooloola regions. In fact, it adds another 20 or 30 people to those out of work as a result of the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hesitate to quote the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation, because it is irresponsible and often untruthful, but that organisation and the Queensland Conservation Council both claim that the Orchid Beach Resort was losing money and was last purchased for less than $200,000. Does the Government seriously believe that the purchase of Orchid Beach for $5m or $6m, with no intended use in mind, has been a good deal and a wise use of taxpayers' money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for greater accountability and, if need be, a full inquiry into the expenditure of the Fraser Island and Great Sandy Region compensation package. Members of the public have a right to know whether the money allocated is just `30 pieces of silver', guilt money, a slush fund, or is being used to create permanent and productive work in the areas damaged by World Heritage listing. Is the money being fairly divided amongst the affected people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's purchase of Orchid Beach at such a remarkable price has sent shock waves through the whole Fraser Island area and, particularly, the tourist industry. Is the Government proposing to close down all tourist operations on Fraser Island and surrounding areas, even though we were told that World Heritage listing was supposed to mean a boost to tourism? All will be dependent upon the development of the management plan. Whether Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region are going to be a great Australian tourist and environmental attraction, or whether the area will be locked away absolutely in an exercise of environmental snobbery, will be determined as this plan is developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern that the plan is being drafted in the Department of Queensland's eccentric Environment Minister, Mr Comben, and that Mr Comben has on his payroll Mr Terry Hampson, the President of FIDO. Mr Hampson has just released FIDO's proposed management strategy for the Great Sandy Region. It calls for a ban on all four-wheel drive vehicles going to Fraser Island, heavily reduced visitor access, road closures, bans on fishing and even bans on the use of sun screen lotions. The management plan needs to ensure that the local community can grow and prosper with their World Heritage listing and not be devoured by it. World Heritage listing does not have to be a death sentence and the Government has a responsibility to ensure that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely that was the very intention of this compensation package&mdash;that the money should be used to create new industry to compensate for the jobs and the income that were lost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out to the honourable gentlemen that of course we were concerned about credit cards and we were concerned about the role played by banks in not passing on information to customers about credit cards. That was our primary motivation in making two recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first was that the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) should conduct a full-blown inquiry into credit cards, their interest rate regimes, the way they are operated and so on. The second was that, because of the issue of disclosure&mdash;or, more precisely, the non-disclosure&mdash;of information on bank products, including credit cards, there should be the development of a code of banking conduct. It was for those very reasons that those two recommendations were put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on the list of papers to be tabled after Question Time today that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) proposes to table the Government's response to the report of the Committee of inquiry into the Australian banking industry. The honourable member for Capricornia will see that again the Treasurer outlines the fact that a code of conduct of banking practice and an inquiry by the PSA into credit cards&mdash;their use, interest rate charging policies and so on&mdash;form part of that response. As the former Chairman of the Committee, I am absolutely delighted with the Government's response to the full inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one or two comments about sports funding. I refer particularly to a letter that I have received from the Confederation of Australian Sport through Mr Dean Moore, the Executive Director. The Confederation of Australian Sport is an organisation which has grown in stature in recent years in this country and I put a great deal of faith in many of the recommendations that it puts forward to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration undertook two inquiries into sports funding and administration when I was Chairman of the Committee. I was pleased to have some fairly close and frequent involvement with the Confederation of Australian Sport to seek its views on what was required. I note that it has put forward to me&mdash;as someone with an ongoing interest in sporting matters&mdash;and to other members of the Government the Confederation's Budget priorities paper for 1992. I know that the Serjeant will have a great deal of interest in this as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading relating to the provision of facilities for sport in this country, it has suggested that we need to reintroduce a major national and international facilities program. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous programs which ran during the 1980s enabled the construction of many significant facilities which have played a sometimes underrated role in the raising of our sporting standards and the emergence of certain sports to greater prominence. It is of vital importance this impetus not be lost.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that a minimum amount of some $40m over the next three years should be made available through the Budget for the development of a national facilities program. I entirely endorse those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the two reports on sports funding that I referred to&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going for Gold</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Can Sport be Bought?</EMPHASIS>&mdash;were tabled in this Parliament and the Government adopted the recommendations flowing from them, we have seen over the last couple of years an increase in sports funding by the Commonwealth Government and I and others have been pressing for a national sports facilities program to become part of the Government's policy. For example, in areas such as the Illawarra, Geelong, Newcastle and other regional centres around Australia, a case can be made for having a funding mechanism of that nature to enable major facilities, such as major grandstands, to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, at Steeler Stadium, Wollongong showground, a case could be made for a further grandstand facility to be constructed, together with a major indoor sports entertainment centre, for a combined cost of around $7m. But, unfortunately, there is not a fund at the moment from which we could seek some allocation of funds so that those facilities could be developed. Therefore, the patrons of the Illawarra Steelers and the patrons of the Illawarra Hawks basketball team have to suffer some disadvantage and some obsolete facilities when watching those two national teams perform to the best of their abilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that the Illawarra Steelers, in third position at the moment on the Winfield Cup table, are doing extremely well, so just think what they would do with better facilities for our patrons who turn up every Saturday or Sunday to watch the Steelers play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the Government give consideration to the views put forward by the Confederation of Australian Sport for facilities of this nature. It is through facilities of a major nature that the people will come to the sports, the sport itself will benefit, and there will be a much needed economic boost to the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sports industry which contributes great volumes of dollars to the economic development of this country.

I understand that Bruce will retire from the ABC in August after 45 years of public life during which he served as a broadcaster with commercial interests and with the ABC, where he commenced as a messenger boy. He has worked with Qantas and was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Bruce has faithfully served both the New South Wales Parliament and this Parliament, the public and the ABC with his work as a parliamentary broadcaster, most recently as the presenter of Question Time telecasts. He has proved an invaluable link between the public and the Parliament, his concern for Parliament and its traditions making the description of proceedings more understandable. It has even been said that he can make the broadcast period of the counting of a division meaningful, which I am sure many of us would find rather interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable member for Burke may well have noticed, as I did, an announcement by Bosch Australia that it intends to invest some $40m or $50m in Australia in order to produce safety products for the Australian motor vehicle industry. This is just one of a long list of investments leading to the expansion of the Australian automotive industry, not just in relation to the domestic market and the changes happening there, but also in response to the expanding export markets which many of these companies are finding for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, we now hear that at the moment Mitsubishi is having difficulty meeting all of its export orders to the United States, to Japan and to European countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, throughout the component industry similar stories are being told&mdash;in the areas of leather manufacturing, aluminium wheels, air-conditioning systems, suspension parts, and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important demonstrations of what the motor vehicle industry can now do, and it is because of a policy this Government has pursued to try to improve the efficiency of the industry. Indeed, the kind of change that has occurred in tariff protection for the industry has been a reduction from 150 per cent in 1984 to 15 per cent destined for the year 2000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports of the continuing bitter disagreements he is having with Senator Collins over the issue of pay TV and the ABC's role in pay TV. Should I conclude from the Prime Minister's last answer that he has unilaterally decided to exclude the ABC from pay TV?  Why is the Prime Minister so committed to sacrificing the ABC's role in pay TV to the obvious benefit of established media proprietors like Mr Packer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins and I have no disagreement whatsoever on pay TV&mdash;none whatsoever. Last evening Senator Collins made his position on this subject clear as day. It was only the Government that provided any space for the ABC in all of this. That was to capitalise it with $12.5m to start off its bid in relation to a consortium&mdash;to bid for the fifth and sixth transponders. The ABC always saw itself in a consortium position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pay television channel to be developed properly, even on the basis of the transponders off the satellite, is somewhere between $400m and $800m to $1 billion. For anybody wanting to go down cable and fibre optics it is a couple of billion dollars. A decision by the Parliament and by the Government to exclusively provide the ABC with a channel would imply that the Government then provides the capital that goes with it: the $ 1/2 billion to $1 billion that would be needed for the ABC to establish itself as a pay operation but, again, for people to pay for the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then is the value of the ABC's free to air charter with a capital contribution from the Government to a pay channel and the ABC being dragged inexorably&mdash;totally virtually in the end&mdash;into a pay system forgoing its great charter of free to air television?  This charter has brought public affairs, dissemination of public issues and other issues of wide interest to Australians, including rural Australians through country programs and the rest. It has truly been a national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no problem about the technological future of free to air television. It is guaranteed by the arrangements and capital which are in place. If those opposite think that we on this side of the House are going to fall for the notion that the ABC should slip a toe, an ankle, a leg or a torso into the mire of pay television and lose its charter, which has been given to it by the Parliament to disseminate news and information to the people of Australia, for the crass, ideological manoeuvrings of the Liberal Party of Australia, they can think again.</PARA>

We on this side of the House have for many years very proudly defended the ABC's interests in this political system as having a right conferred on it by the Parliament.

The Leader of the Opposition's camp, the Hewson camp, wants to announce now what it sees as a big bang in industry in terms of industrial reorganisation. The camp of the honourable member for Bennelong, the Howard camp, wants to conceal and disguise the real agenda. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> on 1 December 1991, the honourable member for Bennelong had this to say about industrial relations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be producing a bill well before the next election, and that is about as far as you can go as far as we're spelling out the details. I don't think there's any doubt in anyone's mind how we intend to change the industrial relations system. I'll be producing in our time a bill which will set out in detail all the changes we intend to make in the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>

<PARA>On 4 March 1992 at the National Press Club, he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the campaign to which the honourable member for Reid refers. It is true that the Housing Industry Association has broken away from all other employer groups and abandoned its housing industry colleagues, the Masters Builders Association, to launch its own politically motivated campaign.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask the question: what is the reality?

Secondly, the industry has repeatedly been assured that genuine subcontractors have nothing to fear and the Minister has indeed removed the clauses that could lead to the fear that unionisation was the intention of the amendment.

This means that an extra $5,700 would be added to the cost of an average house in Sydney.

The fact is that there has been a quite substantial growth in the recycling of newspapers, which are now being picked up at central points and recycled into pulp. This is adding substantially to our pulp capacity. Even though we are not at the point where it is all being recycled and collected, the fact is that industry is now making a greater effort to do it. I think that is very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much more consciousness about waste in packaging, which I think both companies and consumers are focusing upon. When we see the response to campaigns such as Clean Up Australia and the response by ordinary Australians, going out and playing a role in those clean-up campaigns and being conscious of the environment, waste management, litter and all that comes with it, we can see that there is, as a backdrop to good public policy, a decent level of understanding by the community about these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things are about community understanding. I do not think the Government should take the legislative approach to industries or businesses&mdash;which over the long run of industrial development have produced new forms of packaging&mdash;of trying to stigmatise and penalise them as carrying the burden, rather than seeing them as part of a change in culture and attitudes, which I think is the way to go. We are going that way. I think all the authorities&mdash;the State and urban authorities, as well as the big waste management outfits such as the sewerage, water and drainage boards of Australia&mdash;are focusing on questions of air and water cleanliness and removing the problem of large waste dumps around Australia; the problem of trying to find landfill opportunities to take volumes of waste, when in fact the problem is its creation in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the honourable member for North Sydney that we will continue to be vigilant about this. We would rather encourage people to adopt a better policy than coerce them into it or penalise them with legislation, to which I think there would be a reaction and which I do not think would work. If we do not change the attitudes we will not change the problem. This is a real problem for the world, especially the developed countries. The problem is greatest for the United States, but it is also a substantial problem for us, and it needs to be tackled and dealt with without fear or favour over a considerable period of time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This House last night passed the superannuation guarantee levy and, in doing so, it has entrenched in legislation a great reform that will be of great benefit to coming generations of Australians. For the first time in our history, well in advance of reform in other advanced industrial countries, ordinary Australians will be able to build a decent nest egg for their retirement as a result of the policies of the Labor movement. People who are now on average weekly earnings will be able to retire on an income twice the old age pension. It is a matter for which we on this side of the House&mdash;and only we on this side of the House&mdash;can be justifiably proud.

In other words, they want to give a tax incentive for contributions but at the same time to whack a 25 per cent tax rate on super funds. The average rate of tax in this country is below 25 per cent. What concession would there be in superannuation with a 15 per cent up-front tax on employer contributions and then 25 per cent on fund earnings&mdash;a 40 per cent tax rate on individuals, most of whom do not pay much more than 20 per cent.

It represents part of the overall mosaic of policy responses under the Keating Government to enhance the interests and the prospects of this important industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy predicted growth of around 8 to 11 per cent in inbound tourism between now and the year 2000. I am delighted to inform the honourable member for Richmond that the growth rates so far this year are running well in excess of those projections. By way of example, the April figures indicate a 21 per cent increase in tourism during April this year compared to April last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first four months of this year indicate a growth in inbound tourist numbers of around 18 per cent over this time last year, which was a record year. This will lead, conservatively, to about 200,000 jobs being created in this industry over the remainder of this decade&mdash;that is, almost one job in every six. One thing that I can inform the House about in terms of this strategy is something it did not contain: it did not contain a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everyone knows&mdash;and, to be fair to them, even members of the Opposition know&mdash;the goods and services tax is totally hostile to the industry. This industry is our fastest growing export industry. In a desperate bid to placate the industry, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleague the shadow Minister for tourism set up a committee to look at the so-called `impediments' that the GST package&mdash;that is, the Opposition's policy regime&mdash;provides for this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is red hot. Years ago, before I came into this place, I can remember going around the place stuffing leaflets into letter boxes arguing about the Fraser Government's support of the tax-free lunch, putting that up as an example of the total and utter irrelevancy of the then Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is red hot. Not so long ago the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity&mdash;making policy on the run, I might say&mdash;in a public forum to try to placate the industry by raising the prospect of returning this country to the tax-free lunch. What a disgrace. When all of these issues of moment are before the nation, the Leader of the Opposition, this doyen of fiscal rectitude over here, raises a good old fashioned Liberal solution to the angst he has caused in the industry by raising the issue of the tax free lunch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His colleague the shadow Minister for tourism, in perhaps one of the worst introductions to a radio interview that I have heard in my time in politics, was introduced by Malcolm Elliott on the 2GB program in this way: `Here is a man who knows all about lunches. We've had a couple together in the past&mdash;a few at the Cordon Bleu restaurant in Brisbane, a few at the Bourbon and Beefsteak', et cetera.</PARA>

I might remind you and the House that this was a question that was asked by a Labor member about the Government's national tourism strategy. It is now an answer that has wandered into the area of a radio interview involving the honourable member for Fadden, which is totally irrelevant to the Government's national tourism strategy. Indeed, the Minister has spent one minute talking about his great tourism strategy and 10 talking about the Opposition's. I put it to you that he is out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the proposal is only for business lunches. At the end of the day, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, the Ernst and Young inquiry into the cost of the GST for this sector of the industry indicates that it will add not 4.4 per cent, as asserted by the Leader of the Opposition, a man who interjected earlier today that he believed in honesty, but 8 per cent to 10 per cent. So in a vain attempt to placate the industry, we are now proposing a $330m cost to revenue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the right to privacy, while of paramount importance, is not absolute. There is a longstanding tension between minimising fraud on the public purse and minimising intrusion by government bodies into the personal affairs of citizens. Again, a careful balance must be struck. The community expects no less. In working to achieve this balance, we welcome the involvement of the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular and general issues raised by the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the operation of the Privacy Act deserve careful consideration by Government. A working group, chaired by the Attorney-General's Department and including representatives of the Department of Social Security, the Australian Federal Police and the Privacy Commissioner will examine these matters. The examination by this working group of the issues noted by the Privacy Commissioner will include consideration of the use by the Department of Social Security of formal demands for information from other Commonwealth agencies, and the return of information supplied mistakenly or without proper authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts the comment of the Director of the Privacy Compliance Unit that the release of the information by the Australian Federal Police was not in accordance with its own internal procedures governing the release of information, but notes the Director's comments that the release was inadvertent&mdash;paragraph 3.2 of his report. The AFP officer who released the original list on or about 20 December 1991 was not an authorised records review officer under the AFP's internal procedures. The Government accepts the Privacy Commissioner's finding that the internal policy of the AFP relating to the release of information was not adequately implemented in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after the inadvertent release of the information, the AFP examined its internal procedures to ensure that as far as possible there would be no recurrence of this kind of incident. The Commissioner advises that the AFP's training relating to the release of information has been upgraded, that the AFP is confident that effective internal mechanisms now exist to control the release of information and that the need for proper supervision has been reinforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular measures must be accompanied by a more general sympathetic understanding of, and sensitivity to, the fundamental values embodied in the Privacy Act, though also giving due weight to the proper provision for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public purse. For the information of honourable members, I present the following papers:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Opposition notes the views of the Government on this matter. The AIDEX demonstration did create considerable public interest at the time. There is no doubt that there was genuine concern in the Department of Social Security as to whether some of the participants in those demonstrations were receiving the unemployment benefit and, therefore, the question did arise as to whether they were meeting the requirements under the Social Security Act and whether they should be eligible under those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a unique situation. There was a case in November 1991 concerning picketers at the Camperdown abattoir in Victoria who were being paid the unemployment benefit during a dispute over the reopening of this abattoir. This issue was raised by my colleague in the Senate, and Senator Richardson had some comments to make at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that, although the circumstances may vary from detail to detail, the substance of the issue is quite similar, namely, should people be encouraged to spend their time either picketing or, in this case, demonstrating outside the AIDEX exhibition if they are meant to be looking for work in accordance with the quite clear provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue raised by the Privacy Commissioner was to determine the issue as noted: whether these people who were identified in that context were fairly treated by the Department of Social Security and whether their information should have become public. The issue basically comes down to what is public in the context of the list of people who have been arrested. I am reliably informed by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), that the current system is quite clear: once cases go before the courts, they are public. The question arises in this case as to whether the Department of Social Security had access to that information prior to court action being initiated or subsequent to it. The suggestion of the Privacy Commissioner is that the information was prior to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, we support the view of the Government that the ministerial requirements relating to the availability of this information should be reviewed by the appropriate departments, and we will be watching that review with interest. However, we make it absolutely clear that we believe the Social Security Act, in so far as it sets down conditions which must be met by beneficiaries as to whether they are meeting the appropriate work tests, must be carried through, and we support the legal action of the Department of Social Security in making that objective achievable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never before have we had such a disgraceful performance by a Prime Minister in Question Time as we had today in the House.

I will defend Senator Alston all the way. At no stage did he say that euthanasia was policy. At no stage did he say that he personally supported euthanasia, nor do I, and indeed euthanasia is not coalition policy. So let us have that out-front, before the House, in clear-cut terms. It is to the credit of the Minister for Social Security that he had the courage to dare his own Prime Minister, who just a few minutes earlier in Question Time had denied us the right to table the document, by allowing us to do so. I appreciate that action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never has there been a more desperate need to put Australia back on its feet as a consequence of the years of decline we have endured under one Treasurer Keating and now Prime Minister Keating.

We need a coalition government to restore good management and integrity to the governments of this country.

Only when that happens does one realise the election countdown is on and the battle is about to be joined. The honourable member for Throsby likes to go overseas very frequently.

But the chill winds are blowing for Australia as a consequence of the very sudden and sharp upswing occurring now in the New Zealand economy. The truth of the matter is that New Zealand did have a Labor government but had the courage to take on taxation reform well ahead of Australia and get its GST-VAT in place. It had the good luck to elect a National Party government but had the courage to get in place the industrial relations reform required for New Zealand. New Zealand put these two big building blocks in place&mdash;as the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) pointed out&mdash;at the same time as it put in place its waterfront reform, with spectacular growth in productivity.

We have a Prime Minister barely on speaking terms with Minister Beazley; barely able to exchange information on the question of the youth summit. He so hopelessly exposed the Minister when he did interview after interview on Sunday and Monday and was still not able to get the script right because of the communication breakdown.

To be fair, the BHP and OK Tedi syndicate advises in more recent days that it has complied fully with the environmental requirements which must first be imposed by the PNG Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is your debate; it is not our debate. Of course, the Leader of the National Party could scarcely get enough people even to bring the debate on, and then we saw the excruciating agony on the faces of those opposite as he went tortuously through this dreadful recitation. He started off, of course, by referring to Senator Alston, saying what a wonderful fellow this man is, how dreadfully misquoted he had been and how his reputation had been rescued through the tabling of certain papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read what Senator Alston said as reported in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The Opposition is all for upholding the accuracy of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Indeed, Senator Alston does not even dispute that the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> was accurate; all he says is that some interjection was left out. In talking about the impact of the rising age of the population of Australia, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that there is no tidal wave about to engulf us. Someone sent me something the other day and I thought it was very good. It said that with the best will in the world no-one can tell me what is going to happen in 30 or 40 years time. The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic reforms in biotechnology.</PARA>
<PARA>This was in the context of whether or not we have an ageing population and whether or not we will be able to afford to keep this ageing population in something like reasonable comfort in retirement. In that context he talked about euthanasia and biotechnology. So, if he cannot actually get rid of them through euthanasia, he is going to use cryogenic technology, presumably, in order to freeze this problem for a few years. Can one image going to the freezer to see cryogenic granny in her old age? This is the kind of thing that members of the Opposition are putting around. Then they say that Senator Alston has been disgracefully misquoted. I will go on to read what Senator Alston said. He actually accused the Labor Party of having this policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am just saying that, the way some of the honourable senator's colleagues believe in meaningful exits or whatever they call them, they are probably going to be in favour of some form of euthanasia before too much longer.</PARA>
<PARA>So here those opposite are protecting the honour of Senator Alston who not only raised the prospect of euthanasia himself but then went on to ascribe it to the Labor Party as one of our policies. I can tell those opposite why we are a bit hard on Senator Alston. It is because he has engaged in the most outrageous policy and outrageous behaviour in terms of trying to prevent working Australian men and women from getting access to superannuation, which until recently has been denied to them. At the same time as he says that they should not have superannuation, he also says that they cannot expect to have a decent pension under a Liberal government. He talked about this in the context of an interview with, I think, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>; anyway it was reported in that newspaper. In talking about the pension he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pressures will be, it will be very difficult to increase the pension and people ought to recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Realistically, it is unlikely that they would go up much, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are being told&mdash;by the person who suggests that euthanasia or biotechnology might be a solution to the problem of an ageing population&mdash;that as far as he is concerned the Opposition will not be able to do anything about increasing the pension. Yet at the same time he tries to wreck the Government's sensible attempts to provide for people's retirement incomes through the superannuation guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, in a most outrageous campaign, he suggests that the introduction of this arrangement would lead to a reduction in employment of some 100,000&mdash;at one point he got up to 180,000. Who would care? Senator Alston has no regard for the truth and his reputation is as nothing as far as we are concerned. So cry as they might about his faux pas in the Senate, we will tie it around their necks. Those opposite have no aged policy and, therefore, anyone is entitled to assume that these kinds of outrageous suggestions by Senator Alston are actually being taken seriously by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party went on with his rambling speech which, at one point, brought us to the flag. In Question Time he said that the flag has been raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a diversion in relation to policies to better provide for the employment of young people and, surprisingly, old people as well. Presumably he wants jobs for those in retirement. Then he raised it again. He had to screw up all his courage to get himself off the topic of the flag. The flag has become a total obsession with this man. He loves nothing better than to talk about the flag and, at the same time, he says that the Prime Minister, in raising it as an issue some time ago, is just trying to divert attention from other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing the Leader of the National Party had to say was when he strayed into this comparison between Australia and New Zealand. Once again we saw this tendency on the part of the Opposition&mdash;indeed, it is close to becoming an obsession&mdash;of running down Australia. This guy, who likes to wrap himself in the flag and purport the virtues of Australia, cannot resist the temptation; in fact, he goes out with his Leader campaigning on the shortcomings of Australia, the shortcomings of the Australian economy and, more importantly, the shortcomings of Australian people&mdash;the shortcomings of ordinary, decent, working Australian men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet when we look at the record, we see that he has ample opportunity to be praising the creative achievements of Australians in so many regards. What he is wanting to do is simply run down everything that we have done&mdash;run down the achievements of the Australian people as represented in improved export figures, improved tranquillity, industrial relations and an improved inflation rate. All these things are the results of working men and women taking decisions to do better in the work force, to apply themselves more diligently to the task of making Australia once again a greater exporting country, particularly in the manufacturing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does he pay any regard to the great achievements of Australia? No. His eyes stray across the Tasman to that neighbour of ours, New Zealand, whose economy has been close to being a basket case in recent years.

Yet he spent five minutes here running down Australia and saying that we could not hold a candle to the New Zealanders. Just hang around and watch what happens.

In volume terms they increased by around 211 per cent and, as a share of total valued exports of goods and services, manufactured exports rose from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in 10 years, a phenomenal change&mdash;from 10 per cent of exports to 15 per cent of exports.

Is it a failure that manufactured exports are now a bigger component of total exports, which themselves are a much bigger part anyway, so we have a bigger proportion of a bigger pie? Yet the Leader of the National Party decides that this is a failure and this is evidence that Australia has failed and has done worse than New Zealand, which has had a comatose, if not lifeless, economy for about the last four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so many other areas the Leader of the National Party could have referred to Australia's successes. He talked about competitiveness and he waved around this report which is based on at least questionable evidence. But let us say it is right. He wants to say that the fact that we are one step behind New Zealand is a shocking thing. He could have referred to the fact that in terms of our competitiveness we are now 15 per cent better off than in 1982-83. Perhaps he suffers from the same kind of problem as the Leader of the Opposition, who looks at competitiveness graphs upside down. The fact is that we have improved our competitiveness. This is something to celebrate, not disparage. </PARA>

The very suggestion that we would want to hand back to him and his colleagues the future of this economy after they were the ones who, almost single-handedly, delivered an uncompetitive economy during most of the post-war years, is nonsense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something very frightening is happening in this country. We no longer have a parliamentary democracy. Under this Prime Minister we have something closer to a presidency, but without the checks and balances of a congress. What is more frightening is that we have a Prime Minister who is operating on the edge; a Prime Minister who is on a roller-coaster ride, ricocheting from grand announcement to grand announcement, from policy to policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With unemployment over 10 per cent, the Prime Minister gave us One Nation. Before fading into oblivion, One Nation was pushed off the stage by the Prime Minister's republican flag debate, which gave us the second distraction: One Nation became the Divided Nation. Already collapsing under the weight of massive unemployment, Australia was polarised and Australians were unsure of who they were or what they stood for. Racism was wrong, or was it? Suddenly it was okay to have contempt for the flag and despise the English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Republicanism and changing the flag are both legitimate subjects to raise, but they are not legitimate at the time of the greatest crisis facing the country this century. If the Prime Minister doubts that this is our greatest crisis, with over a third of our youth unemployed&mdash;46 per cent in Victoria and South Australia&mdash;there are thousands in my electorate who would love to tell him differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was most contemptible about the Prime Minister's promotion of the flag and republicanism as a major issue was the particularly nasty way he did it. It was not good enough to raise the issue; he had to insinuate that those who believed in a constitutional monarchy, those who wanted to keep the Australian flag as it is, were not only out of tune with the times but were toadies to another country, lackeys of another government. It was a despicable piece of theatre politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation was devised to distract the country from unemployment; the Divided Nation to distract the country from the failure of One Nation. As the Divided Nation backfired, with Australians resenting the attempts to change the flag by fiat, the Prime Minister gave us the distractions of pay TV, airline privatisation and the Commonwealth takeover of TAFE. When they started to look a bit pale around the edges, along came the Youth Summit, but not before the Prime Minister had tried so hard to disguise the statistics. `It is not a third', he said, `it is only 10 per cent'. With over 100,000 young people out of work, it was a cruel and callous piece of sophistry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For six months the Prime Minister has been making policy not so much on the run as out of the blue. What he is leaving behind is a confused country, an impotent Parliament, and Ministers with egg on their faces. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) have been made to look ridiculous. They do not even know what is going on in their own portfolios. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Minister, Mr Beazley, was forced to admit yesterday that he did not know whether next month's youth jobs summit would be public or what role young people would have in it. . . Asked about the part young people would have, Mr Beazley said: "Again, I'm not absolutely certain about what role young people would have".</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Minister who is responsible. No wonder he did not know. His Prime Minister failed to tell him. He left him sitting there looking stupid without the answers. It is the Prime Minister who is making policy when it suits him and how it suits him. He disregards every one of the Ministers as he sees fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), pointed out, there is a definite Whitlamesque air to this Government. In less than 12 months we have had two Prime Ministers and four Treasurers. There was Senator Richardson's Marshall Islands affair, with guest appearances by Senator Evans and Senator Sibraa, and the ludicrous episode of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) claiming she endorsed only the front of the disastrous, inflammatory and inaccurate environment kit, not the kit itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stories are leaking out of the Ministry as Ministers express their dissatisfaction to anyone and everyone. I believe that the Prime Minister holds his Ministers of such little account that he is apt to keep Cabinet waiting for two hours. There are other aspects of the Prime Minister's behaviour which cause enormous disquiet. The way abuse is used as a form of rhetoric scares and angers many of my constituents. Abuse is central to our Prime Minister's mode of operation: one wins not by being better or doing better, but by destroying one's opponent; what matters the level of hypocrisy that one has to stoop to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last sitting of Parliament, the Prime Minister tried to tar the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) with being sons of the capitalist system. They were the rich; he represented the poor. He dwelt on the Leader's Ferrari. Yet on Sunday we learned that this Prime Minister, who has so much contempt for the Leader's Ferrari, himself owns a powder blue Mercedes, not to mention a four-storey townhouse, an extremely profitable piggery, and quite a few other little assets, which hardly makes him a typical representative of the proletariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a fair cop by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>, but not according to the Prime Minister. This is where we see another side of him. On Sunday morning, as the honourable member for Farrer has said, the editor and deputy editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> were phoned by the Prime Minister. This is a direct quote from Mr Guthrie:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He spent the best part of two hours berating the two of us over a story which I thought was not inconsequential but was pretty well straight up and down. . . He vowed to cut us off dead, that was his expression. . . When I asked him if this amounted to a ban, he said, `yes for as long as I am here, in fact for as long as I live, no member of my staff will be permitted to talk to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> and that applies to (Treasurer) John Dawkins' office as well'.</PARA>
<PARA>Pretty good stuff! That is how we want our Prime Minister to act: why not threaten everybody when they get out of line? The Prime Minister is adept at dishing out criticism, but his inability to accept it and retaliating by trying to silence his critics concerns me, as I am sure it concerns other members of this House. His behaviour lacks balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the Prime Minister's lack of responsibility in running this country. Australian goods are not competitive against imports and, on the whole, not competitive enough against exports. Everyone knows that the reason is the cost we put on goods during their manufacture: the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, petrol tax, training guarantee levy and superannuation imposts. Imports do not have these charges and taxes built into them and are therefore relatively cheaper. The answer is clear. The Prime Minister knows it and the Parliament knows it. We have to remove these taxes and charges. The way to remove them is to replace them with a consumption tax&mdash;a consumption tax that falls equally on locally made and imported goods and is excluded from exports, making them competitive overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was a strong advocate of the consumption tax because he knew it was the one way to get Australian businesses competitive again. Nothing has changed since he made his commitment to the consumption tax, except that the Opposition has put forward a plan to introduce it. The Prime Minister's primary goal is not the reduction of unemployment and not the recovery of this country; it is simply to ensure his own continued prime ministership, and he will do anything to ensure that. I find that very frightening. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members opposite, who threw out Australia's longest serving Labor Prime Minister, whether they are not scared about what they have in his place: a Prime Minister who does not build but who destroys; a Prime Minister who overrules and disregards his Ministers: a Prime Minister whose main weapon is abuse; a Prime Minister who acts totally and utterly inappropriately on foreign soil, kissing the ground at one time, passing on messages like a lackey at other times; a Prime Minister who will say one thing one day and deny it the next; a Prime Minister who can call black white and not even flinch; a Prime Minister who cannot and will not accept criticism and who threatens those who dare criticise him; a Prime Minister who is responsible for the disastrous state of this country, who will not take responsibility for the disasters he has created, and who seeks, by one means or another, to distract from the real issues to perpetuate his own personal power. </PARA>

I think it should be pointed out that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which recently brought down a report on relationships with PNG, suggested that some sort of a watchdog arrangement be put in place to oversight environmental consequences associated with that mine, and particularly the flow of effluent into the Fly River. As somebody who I understand has been to PNG, that is something which he would probably like to see put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the course of this debate both the Leader of the National Party and the honourable member for Hawker, who unfortunately seems to have left the chamber now, talked about due process and due process of government. They talked about structural change, industrial relations, taxation reform, micro-economic reform, and a whole range of issues associated with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) apparently has been unable to achieve. They talked about his lack of achievement since he became Prime Minister and, indeed, when he was the Treasurer of this country for many productive years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also heard criticism of the fact that the Prime Minister has been overseeing the regulation of the financial services industry in this country to make us internationally competitive. He has overseen, as I said a little earlier, a sustainable low inflation rate of about 1.6 per cent with an underlying rate of 2 1/2 to 3 per cent, which will ensure that our economic prosperity is certain. We have seen the Prime Minister oversee a radical proposal in the airlines industry&mdash;something which probably should have been done years ago when we were talking about how best to save Australia's finances. Money was being ploughed into the airlines to keep them afloat when it could have been invested somewhere else in more productive things as far as the Government was concerned. Yet we have heard criticisms of that. </PARA>

He has been able to talk on previous occasions about the pay television debate and the ideas that he has for that&mdash;which his Cabinet and, more importantly, the Party, have supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me confide one or two things to the very few members of the Opposition who are in the chamber at the moment. On the Government side we have a due process&mdash;which the Opposition talked about&mdash;whereby Ministers bring forward ideas on policy which are then discussed with Caucus committees. Those Caucus committees&mdash;I have been on one or two and had a few discussions there myself&mdash;can occasionally get a bit out of hand because everyone wants to put a point of view. A number of views are represented and forcefully put, but at the end of the day a decision is taken; views are adopted. They are subsequently debated again by a full Caucus&mdash;that is, by the full Australian Labor Party complement of this Parliament&mdash;and finally put on the record as being a policy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that exhaustive process, what we have achieved in regard to all of the things that the Opposition has berated the Prime Minister over is universal acceptance in the Caucus. A decision is taken, and the Caucus supports it and will get out and sell it. Yet we have seen nothing but criticism of the Prime Minister because of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hawker made one or two interesting observations about the Prime Minister. She criticised him for bringing forth the One Nation statement, a statement which will revolutionise freight transport in this country; improve access to ports; improve our international competitiveness; and improve the ability of Australians in manufacturing and primary industry to move goods around this country, get them to the ports and get them away. She criticised other decisions contained in that document which will see the economic benefits already flowing in this country accelerated. We have seen nothing but criticism&mdash;not even one skerrick of commendation of the Prime Minister for bringing forth a document of that magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hawker also said that the Prime Minister did terrible things by threatening people, and she used the example of the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age,</EMPHASIS> some words apparently having been exchanged between the Prime Minister and the editors of that particular newspaper. Let me tell members of the Opposition about a couple of little telephone conversations that have occurred between the Leader of the Opposition and business leaders of this country. Let me tell them about the times when the business leaders of this country have come out and said to the Australian Labor Party, to the Government, `We actually like the things that you're doing. We actually like the fact that you reduced company tax rates. We actually liked the fact that you removed the double imputation regime that applied to the taxation of business. We actually like the fact that the taxation of business inputs has been reduced. We like a lot of those things'. </PARA>

We see the old Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the dog and bone to all of these people, abusing them for daring to come out and support the Labor Party in government in all of these different actions. Talk about double standards; and talk about the hypocrisy of the contribution of the honourable member for Hawker, who is worried about the Prime Minister ringing some newspaper editor to complain about delving into the man rather than playing the ball, as seems to be the wont of many people. I point the finger well and truly at Senator Michael Baume, who started that whole fiasco and tried to drum something up out of absolutely nothing. </PARA>

It is absolute nonsense. She talked about the consumption tax and how nothing has changed since the Prime Minister supported it back at the tax summit in 1985-86&mdash;or whenever it was in our now recent history. Nothing has changed? What about the capital gains tax? What about the free lunches tax that we eliminated? What about all the so-called nasties that have been put in place by this Government, and what about the changes to the overall tax mix? The Opposition turns around and says we need to do something more. What absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate was supposed to be about how the process of government has failed under this Prime Minister. That is an absolute nonsense.

Report 317 presents the Committee's findings and recommendations on an inquiry into the Department of Defence's supply system redevelopment project or, as it is more commonly known, SSRP. SSRP aims to create a common core computing system to cater for the supply needs of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The title of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Champagne Appetite but only a Beer Income </EMPHASIS>sums up SSRP&mdash;it is a project which, quite simply, seeks to do too much. Having commenced in the mid-1970s, SSRP is not scheduled for completion until 1998. SSRP is closely linked to another defence project, namely, DESINE. During the inquiry into SSRP a significant amount of the Committee's time was taken up with the DESINE contract&mdash;a five-year contract with IBM, which makes IBM the sole supplier of computer equipment until February 1994. Although DESINE was intended to support open systems, the Department of Defence later described it as an implementation of systems application architecture, or SAA as it is more commonly known&mdash;an IBM proprietary architecture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concludes that, with the DESINE request for tender, the Department of Defence set out with a clear intention to support international standards for open systems, but the outcome of the tendering process left it with an unsatisfactory solution. At best IBM may approve systems application architecture to support open systems and at worst the Department has acquired a proprietary structure which only directly supports IBM proprietary products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examination of the DESINE request for tender has drawn the Committee's attention to the fact that billions of dollars are spent on information technology by the Commonwealth each year but unfortunately very little is known about the equipment and systems owned by the Commonwealth departments. To remedy this situation, the Committee has recommended that departmental annual reports contain a comprehensive listing of current information technology assets to detail the quantity and current value of these assets. The Committee is of the view that no future information technology acquisition contract should contain a sole supplier clause, nor should any such contract be written so that another sole supplier situation can eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to SSRP, the Committee considers the achievements of the project not to have been encouraging. In fact, the Committee is quite critical of the administration and global management of the project. The inquiry into SSRP has been one of the more complex and technical inquiries to have been conducted by the Committee. It required the examination of a number of difficult information technology issues upon which even experts could not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the finalisation of the inquiry with this report, it is to be noted that, as with all inquiries by parliamentary committees, changes in the area of investigation occur, not just because of a report and its recommendations, but because of the raising and consideration of an issue during an inquiry. This has undoubtedly been the case with the inquiry into SSRP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to comment on the 318th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;a report on public sector research and development. The starting point for the Committee's inquiry into R&amp;D in Australia was two contrasting facts: firstly, that Australian people have a reputation for inventiveness and its scientists a high standing in their professions; and, secondly, that Australia is not known for its ability to translate its research discoveries and inventiveness into dollars. The Committee sought to establish why this situation exists and how it can be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's inquiry into R&amp;D was started in 1989 to review research and development in the public sector. When it was taken up again at the start of this Parliament, its terms of reference were extended to examine the Government's support for R&amp;D in the private sector. The report that I am tabling today contains the Committee's conclusions and recommendations relating to its first term of reference&mdash;R&amp;D in the public sector. We will table our report on R&amp;D in the private sector during the Budget session of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical point in considering the contribution of research and development to the nation is its interrelatedness with many other facets of national endeavour and the policies determining them. The education system must deliver adequate numbers of appropriately trained scientists and research administrators to satisfy the demand for personnel. Accommodation and equipment must be supplied to the research institutions to enable them to continue to work with technologically sophisticated methodologies at the forefront of knowledge. If research developments are to be commercialised cost effectively, research must be an integral part of the industrial process. Above all, Australia needs a scientifically literate population. The positive role that R&amp;D can play in the nation's prosperity and international standing must be more widely understood and the outlook of our leaders in industry must be based on this understanding. To achieve these goals, the Committee has made recommendations relating to providing the equipment and accommodation for scientific research, training in science and research management in universities, and raising the profile of science in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the guidelines for the Government's support for R&amp;D in the public sector. In the present economic circumstances there are great pressures to cut costs and use public funds as efficiently as possible. The Committee therefore paid considerable attention to the best way of wisely managing the considerable assistance provided by the Government for R&amp;D&mdash;$2.6 billion this financial year. We concluded that two points are important and have made recommendations to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is that public sector research organisations should not be involved in fields in which the private sector can expect to conduct R&amp;D for profit. The primary aim of public sector research organisations should be the conduct of longer term, basic research and research for the benefit of the community as a whole. For example, they should be involved with research on such topics as public health and understanding the environment and how our society is adjusting to the changes that it is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's second point is that priorities for spending on research should be determined in the light of criteria selected to obtain maximum benefit for the nation. This means considering the wider public interest as well as possible economic returns. A method of using criteria like this to set priorities for spending on research has been developed by the CSIRO and picked up and used by a variety of organisations. The Committee believes that this is a valuable approach that should be further developed and widely used in priority setting exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If decisions are to be made about what research the public sector should carry out and which areas of research are most important, information must be available to decision makers. The Committee found that much of the necessary information is lacking and several of the Committee's recommendations are directed towards ensuring that it is collected and that it is then accessible to those who need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to commercialisation. Research organisations have, for some time, been facing pressures to cut costs and focus on commercial applications for their research. As this has happened, it has become clear that a new balance must be found between the traditional roles of these organisations and their research staff and the new one that emphasises commercialisation. For example, how should an organisation's research effort be divided between the short term process of developing applications for their research and the long term basic research that may show no returns to the nation for many years, if at all? Can researchers cope with the demands of managing their research to tight targets, selling their ideas to industry and working within the constraints of a commercial timetable? Asking researchers to assume tasks additional to their research has required additional organisational changes and changes to the culture within which they all work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to strike a balance between long term basic research and shorter term strategic and applied research. How this balance is struck is vital. The private and public sectors both warned that it would be a fatal mistake for Australia not to maintain its research capacity and the flow of information about the fundamental natural and physical processes of the world. This information is the foundation of applied science and an important step on the path to the ultimate commercialisation of various research results. It is therefore essential that, in the current emphasis on the commercialisation of R&amp;D, we not overlook the need to continue basic longer term research and maintain the national capacity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to turn to the costs of commercialisation. The Committee identified three important points in relation to commercialisation and public sector research:  firstly, we need to be aware of the costs of commercialisation when public sector research organisations are charged with commercialising their work and we must provide for these needs to be met; secondly, a reasonable rate of return must be obtained from the Government's investment of funds in R&amp;D; and, thirdly, the charges that should be made for research contracted from public sector organisations by outside bodies needs to be addressed. The Committee favours passing on the full cost of carrying out such work for the private sector. Passing on the full cost of research to other government bodies may not be appropriate; they may not be able to afford it unless they are provided with additional funds. A good case exists for such public interest projects being carried out without full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee examined six public sector research organisations in some detail. They were  CSIRO, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and the Bureau of Mineral Resources. We found a number of shared problems among these organisations. They are short of funds for capital works and staffing is difficult at times because salaries are not high enough to attract the best people. The efficiency dividend imposed across the public sector on administrative expenses has also been applied to research activities, which appears not entirely appropriate. Annual and even triennial funding does not provide an adequate framework for the planning and prosecution of very long term research projects. Raising funds for research from non-government sources cuts down the time that research organisations can devote to actual research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made recommendations relating to these concerns, including recommendations for increased funding for long term research. The Committee has also made recommendations about other issues, amongst which are two that I will mention briefly: firstly, research into radioactive waste management, the provision of a nuclear waste depository, and the regular inspection of the nuclear reactors by independent observers; and, secondly, levying the tourist industry to help finance environmental research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, both the reports I have presented today are important. Hopefully, the report on SSRP will lead to better value for money in the Defence Department's spending and project management. The report on R&amp;D contributes to the harnessing of Australia's research capacity to our economic well-being and maintaining the role played by scientific research in our nation's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend both reports to the House. In so doing, I wish to place on record not only my thanks as Chairman but also the entire Committee's thanks to the following officers for their work: in research and development Miss Fiona Taylor; Mr Tony Lawrence of the Audit Office; Dr Sarah Hnatiuk of the staff; Dr Mike Ryan of the Audit Office; Mrs Laraine Brennan; and Mrs Lorraine Hendy.

<PARA>The first of these proposals relates to the Defence Force structure review, the outcome of which was announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. One major feature of the force structure review was the fact that a Regular Army brigade is to be permanently based in Darwin by the end of this decade. That will be achieved by the staged relocation of southern-based units to the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is the first of two stages for the construction of working, training and accommodation facilities for those units. The facilities are to be constructed at the site of the new Army barracks that are currently being constructed for the Second Cavalry Regiment, which is relocating to Darwin by the end of this year. The estimated cost of the proposal is $177m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal is for the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Army Barracks in Darwin. Those barracks, as honourable members will know, were first constructed at the time of the Second World War. They have undergone very little in the way of development since that time. The Army is experiencing chronic overcrowding problems there, and the condition of the working and living accommodation at Larrakeyah can safely be described as some of the worst in the country. This proposal will rectify those current problems, primarily through the refurbishment of existing facilities and the construction of a new facility for the joint headquarters of Northern Command. The estimated cost of this proposal is $26m. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the reference of these projects to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I point out that during the life of the Fraser Government and to some extent beyond it there has been an increasing defence presence in the north of Australia, with the establishment of Northern Command in Darwin, Tindal air base near Katherine, the creation of the bare base airfield at Derby and the proposed airfield near Weipa. The reference to the Public Works Committee involves another very substantial infrastructure development for an increased Army presence in the north. The coalition believes in the need for a strong defence presence in the north, and through the Public Works Committee will keep a very close watch on the timing and composition of the proposed relocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough simply to relocate forces to Darwin unless these forces are appropriate to our defence requirements and can be cost effectively supplied and supported using the resources of the local community. Certainly the cost of this relocation program mentioned by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), some $177m, is an enormous amount of money, particularly at a time when there is a great squeeze on defence spending. Therefore, the coalition believes that this reference to the Public Works Committee is a very important one which can be used to make a careful assessment of the cost benefits of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reference to the Committee is to refurbish the facilities at Larrakeyah Barracks and to develop a new facility for joint headquarters. Again, the total cost of the project, which in this case is $28m, seems very substantial. I have no argument with the refurbishment of the barracks, I must say, because they are certainly in need of modernising, as the Minister would know. But I would hope that some hard thought is put into the cost of the new NORCOM headquarters, in particular in deciding on precisely what command facilities are needed in Darwin. In part, this issue can be dealt with only if we examine the nature of the Defence Force command structure, which we on this side of the House believe needs a good deal of modification and simplification. I hope that these matters are also considered by the Public Works Committee when looking at this second reference. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of a new International Terminal Complex for the Federal Airports Corporation at Brisbane Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>International passenger growth at Brisbane Airport has been particularly strong, requiring several expansions to the existing international terminal building. This building is now operating beyond its design capacity. To prevent passenger delays becoming a serious issue, the FAC proposes to construct a new international terminal complex. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) foreshadowed an early completion for this project in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current complex, which is to be located approximately two kilometres to the south of the domestic terminal, will be a modern, high-tech facility with three levels, an elevated entrance and associated roadways, car parking, apron and landing areas. It provides for seven international gates, four stand-off non-aerobridge gates, three baggage reclaim units and three check-in islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed facility will have the capacity to handle 1,065 passengers per peak hour. On current growth of passenger demand, it is expected that the terminal will satisfy Brisbane's need in this form until 1999. The facility which has a current outturn cost of $272m will take about 30 months to construct. During that period it will provide employment for approximately 450 people, rising to 700 during the peak construction period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the recent aviation policy initiatives, the design will be reviewed to provide a flexible terminal complex capable of being expanded progressively to accommodate a range of possible future airlines and passenger processing requirements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Opposition welcomes this reference to the Public Works Committee of the new international terminal at Brisbane International Airport. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that it is one of the most needed pieces of aviation infrastructure in Australia. I urge the Committee to take up the point mentioned by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in the second last paragraph: the flexibility of the terminal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the record of the Public Works Committee in determining the needs of Brisbane has not always been as good as it should have been. In 1979-80, when the subject of a new terminal was first raised that Committee decided not to proceed with it. Since then, we have seen the Commonwealth Games come to Brisbane and a request was made for a terminal, which was knocked back. We knew then that there was going to be growth for Expo, but nothing was done. We have finally been caught out because, at certain peak hours during the week, Brisbane Airport does not have enough gates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Public Works Committee to consider some of the projections that are presently being made around the world by experts. Initially the Federal Airports Corporation, in a joint study with the British Airports Authority, decided that Brisbane would become the second busiest international airport in Australia by the year 2007. That estimate has been revised, as was indicated in the Minister's speech. The Boeing Corporation estimated that Brisbane would surpass Melbourne as the number two international airport by the year 2000. Its estimates have always been very conservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are not careful, I believe that we could have dreadful traffic problems in Brisbane as early as 1997-98. I therefore urge the Public Works Committee to consider those projections very carefully and to make sure that there is absolute flexibility in being able to open up that terminal with more than the seven international gates, plus the four stand-off non-aerobridge gates which are proposed at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;good luck to it&mdash;in a local sense has said that it does have some concern and is monitoring the situation in Brisbane. Perhaps it should go straight to the twelve plus seven gates as soon as it possibly can. I trust that the Public Works Committee will do this because, as I say, this will be one of the most urgent pieces of aviation infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of international air traffic into Brisbane has been quite phenomenal. It will not cease. There are already a number of new international carriers which want to operate in Brisbane and existing carriers want to increase their services. Frankly, they are hampered by the lack of terminal space. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in welcoming this motion to refer this proposal for the Brisbane Airport to the Public Works Committee. The Committee should keep in mind the future of this terminal development in Brisbane. The coalition parties are committed to the concept of privatising Australia's airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that not only should airports be constructed to serve the traffic of people who move in and out of those airports but also they should be constructed in such a way that they serve the local communities. It is very important to understand, when talking about the service to the local communities, that we mean that people who are involved locally should have a say in what happens to their airport. The thrust behind our privatisation program is that these airports should reflect the interests of the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the coalition parties are not wildly enthusiastic about the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation as a whole. We do not think that for all the good things the Federal Airports Corporation does, a Sydney-based, nationwide, monopoly, bureaucracy necessarily knows how the best interests of local communities could be served. In that respect we have already spoken about the transfer of the ownership of Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne to local interests. A group called the Committee for Melbourne has been pushing Minister Collins quite strongly to reach that objective, and we want to see the same thing happen with Brisbane Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why airports should not be major centres of education, training, wholesale activities, retailing, in which a large competitive environment can be opened out with benefits to consumers, in this case the travelling public. Also there is no reason why the Government should not establish regulations to prevent people who own airports in local communities taking advantage of the monopoly situation that might arise in the provision of aviation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the motion. My colleague the honourable member for Fadden has already asked that the Committee keep in mind growth changes that might occur that would make this proposal out of date sooner rather than later. We also want to enjoin the Public Works Committee to ensure that it keeps in mind the fact that when the coalition comes to government it will privatise Brisbane Airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), who represents the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment and Fitout of Juliana House, Phillip, Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>The building will be occupied by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, which is consolidating its accommodation in the Woden Town Centre. The refurbishment will include upgrading of the air conditioning, lighting, lift, electrical and fire services to bring them up to standards required at modern office accommodation and the current building regulations. The project includes an allowance for fitout to tenant specifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in March 1992 and the Committee tabled its report on 2 June 1992 recommending that the proposal should proceed. However, the Committee expressed its concern that the limit of cost estimate of $8.78m in February 1992 prices was excessive and recommended that the project should be re-examined with the aim of reducing the estimated cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of work to be undertaken in this refurbishment is necessary to ensure that the building is tenanted and therefore able to maintain its income earning capacity. The cost estimates for Juliana House are below the national average for an equivalent office refurbishment, based on advice from the Project Manager, Australian Construction Services. Australian Estate Management is the sponsor of the project and has noted the concerns of the Public Works Committee, particularly in relation to the estimated cost of the project. AEM is charged with providing a return on investment to government from its investment in office real estate and accordingly it places a singular focus on cost control in its management role in order to minimise the cost to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A construction management method of delivery will be employed on Juliana House and tenders will be sought on all trade works packages which will ensure that costs are minimised and reflect competitive marketplace prices. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will pay a market rent for its occupation of Juliana House. It has advised that the move to Juliana House is expected to have a negligible effect on its overall rent costs. However, the benefits will be achieved through its further collocation in the Woden area, including increased administrative efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Estate Management&mdash;and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, as the future tenant of the building&mdash;has noted all the Committee's recommendations. Australian Estate Management has undertaken to provide the Committee with the results of an energy audit after the building has been occupied for 12 months. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concerns of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works were not acted upon; they were not even listened to. I note that the Committee had a number of concerns. When the matter came before the House on 2 June, the Committee expressed a number of concerns and I will cover them one by one. I share the Committee's concerns in regard to the cost. The cost of $8.78m in February 1992 terms would indicate to me that the price will blow out to probably about $9m. I agree that the estimated time of 15 months appears to be a substantially long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report that the Committee brought down, the architect pointed out that the refurbishment cost of $1,300 per square metre was extremely expensive. I share that view. The going rate around town&mdash;I have made some inquiries in Canberra&mdash;is about $600 per square metre. The architect said that a new building can be constructed for about $1,200 per square metre; whereas the Department claimed that it was $1,800. Basically any building can be designed to cost as much as we like. That is what the Department appears to have done in this case. The schedules published&mdash;and there are a number&mdash;outlined building construction costs. For multistorey buildings of 15 storeys and below in Canberra, the cost was put at $1,200 per square metre. It is interesting to note that buildings of 15 storeys to 35 storeys came in at the rate of $1,800 per square metre. That appears to be the rate that the Department is hanging its hat on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report went on to say that the Committee had a concern in relation to the showers being placed on the ground floor and the cost of those showers and toilets. The architect said that under the Australian building code there were more toilets than were necessary and it would seem to make sense to convert one of those toilets&mdash;there are both male and female&mdash;on each floor to a shower. The Department seemed to indicate, at item 47 of the report, that the current number of toilet facilities per floor equate to the number in the building code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very misleading. I am a registered builder and, in fact, I have an extract from the national building code. Under that code the number of persons per pan fixture is 20 for males and 15 for females, and there are 25 urinals. The Committee's suggestion to convert one of the toilets&mdash;bearing in mind that there are three pans for females and two pans and one urinal for males&mdash;is eminently sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, unisex shower blocks on the ground floor are not favoured by staff and will not be used. It has been suggested that female employees will enter the building after jogging and use the unisex shower facility. I note that in item 49 the Department agreed with the Committee's conclusion that single-sex showers were preferred by the staff and supported the argument that putting showers on individual floors would be a good idea. I am disappointed that it has ignored this completely. Juliana House has a gross floor area of 9,254 square metres and a net lettable floor area of 6,697 square metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lease from the Department is a five plus five lease. Quite frankly, for the money spent&mdash;$9m-odd&mdash;a five-year lease is chicken feed. No-one in the private sector would spend that sort of money for such a short initial lease. The option is of no value to the landlord; options are of value only to the tenant. As to the rental return for the first year&mdash;we are not told the rent review dates or what the amounts will be, or what schedule for the review will be observed, whether it is to market, the CPI or whatever&mdash;the base rental per annum is $1.5m, giving a rate of $224 per square metre. The rate per square metre is competitive, so I am quite happy with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that the Department did run a model in regard to its investment. In doing that, it claimed that its return was quite satisfactory. I am unsure how it arrived at that conclusion. If one were to look at $9m at the 10-year bond rate&mdash;which is currently about 8.75 per cent&mdash;one would be looking at an annual return of $787,500. If one invested that money at the 60-day bill rate, which at present is 6.35 per cent, one would be looking at an annual return of $571,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this development is that there will not be any rent at all for the first 15 months, so we might as well wipe off $1.875m. I hope the model took holding costs into account. A private sector developer would have to factor in during the building period&mdash;and I have run down a facility on that on a draw-down factor&mdash;something like $430,000 in holding costs. Sure, the Department does not have to pay interest on the money but, as I have demonstrated, if that money were out in the private sector market, a more substantial return would be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also pointed out that it was most concerned about the time taken for this project. It should be concerned. I think that was a very valid point. If the construction time were shortened by two months, the extra rental income to the Commonwealth would be $76,000. If one were to take holding costs into account, the turnaround figure would be $126,000. The cost of the upgrade&mdash;$1,300-odd per square metre&mdash;is very high. It over-capitalises this building, and at a rate the Department will not get back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department went on to say that, if it wanted to sell this building, the problem would be that it has no rental return. In order to sell buildings in the Woden Valley, one would need to get a return on investment of between 10 and 11 per cent. That is because people will take a lower rate with CBD developments because they will get a greater capital gain. That means that, for a start, there would need to be a minimum initial lease period of eight years, bearing in mind that this one is for only five years. The building fully tenanted on that basis is worth about $14m. One needs to discount the $9m spent on it, and that leaves only $5m. In addition, of course, we have to look at lost rent, holding costs and the over-capitalisation of the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This site has been vacant since October 1991. The Government should follow the Committee's recommendation. As I have mentioned, I am concerned that it has snubbed a very wise recommendation by the Committee. I believe that it should call for tender submissions from the private sector for this project. Because Australian Construction Services is project manager for this project, it is very unlikely that the project would come in on time and on budget. The only way the Government is going to fix its costs is to ask for submissions on this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of money to be spent on upgrading this building is incredibly high. I share the Committee's view in regard to that matter. The Minister has not addressed these points. Whichever way one tries to cut the cake, the project does not stack up. I think the Minister should have had the good sense to take the advice of the Committee and have that figure reviewed downward very substantially. He should also pick up the very sensible suggestion of the Committee that the showers should be placed on the relevant floors and a toilet converted from the excess toilets for both males and females on those respective floors. He should have picked up the fact that the proposed construction time is excessive and should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not be supporting this motion because, as I mentioned, the motion has snubbed the Committee's recommendations. It shows that the Minister does not have the ability to manage his portfolio. He should not allow matters like this to go through, particularly when the Committee has raised these points. I believe that it has a sensible basis on which to raise the points. In my view, the figures back the Committee and do not back the Department. </PARA>

<PARA>The National Health and Medical Research Council is Australia's peak advisory body on public health, health care, health and medical research and health ethics. The Council is one of Australia's great public institutions with a long history. In 1926, following the report of a Royal Commission on Health, a Federal Health Council was established to promote cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States on matters of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health and Medical Research Council was established in 1936 by Executive order and replaced the Federal Health Council. The functions of the first Council, as described by Billy Hughes in his opening address in 1937, were `to promote the health of the people of Australia, to protect them from disease; and to advise, coordinate and direct research into the cause of, and cure for those diseases, which levy so heavy a toll upon the community, and which have hitherto baffled medical science'. While in essence the functions of Council have changed little, they have been refined over time to reflect the changing nature of the health issues facing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception in 1936, the advice of the NHMRC has been treated with the highest regard, and a situation exists today where its recommendations and guidelines are adopted nearly automatically in a range of public health areas and it plays a highly influential role in advising on health care practice matters. For example, recently the NHMRC has provided guidance on matters as diverse as drugs and poisons, child health, communicable diseases, environmental health, ethics, medical and nursing practices, radiation, women's health, public health and psychiatry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1937, Billy Hughes noted that the NHMRC is `national in the broadest sense', and indeed this remains the case. The States have a high degree of interest and involvement in the Council's public health functions, and NHMRC recommendations are often adopted in State law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, it becomes increasingly anomalous that the Council is not established by legislation. There can be little doubt that, if we were creating such a body today, it would be set up by legislation in the Parliament&mdash;to clearly establish its role, its independence and its accountability. During 1990, when the Council was undertaking its regular triennial review, I had the question of legislation examined and I was convinced that the anomalous position of the Council, where it could have been abolished by any government of the day at the stroke of a pen, needed to be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health and Medical Research Council should be a creation of the Parliament of Australia, not simply of the executive government. This Bill will provide the NHMRC with a level of power and accountability in keeping with the status it has now achieved. The Council deals with issues that are of direct concern to all Australians in one way or another&mdash;from the food we eat to the air we breathe. These issues should continue to be dealt with expertly and impartially, and all citizens should be comfortable in the knowledge that the peak body for advising on these matters is beyond interference. Only statutory independence can ensure that degree of comfort and confidence for the community. Of equal importance, the community is entitled to be confident that such a vital body will operate in a public and open manner and be accountable for its actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will enshrine the independence of the Council and define its relationship with the Parliament and the Minister and with the States and Territories. The Bill details the role NHMRC will play in advising the Commonwealth and State governments and the Australian community on health and medical research, public health, health care and health ethics. The principal functions given to the Council in the Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(a) to inquire into, to advise and issue guidelines and to make recommendations on the improvement of health; and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease; the provision of health care; public health research and medical research; and ethical issues relating to health; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(b) to make recommendations to the Commonwealth on expenditure on public health research and medical research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of NHMRC is covered in the Bill. Over the years, in keeping with the changing nature of community interest in and expectations of participation in health matters, the Council and its committees have been expanded beyond solely an expert group. That health was too important to be left entirely to the professions was recognised at the time of the creation of the Council as its membership then included `an eminent layman and laywoman'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included on Council as defined in the Bill are members with stipulated backgrounds and knowledge in the fields of medical standards and postgraduate medical training; health care training; the medical profession; the nursing profession; the trade union movement; business; consumer issues; social welfare services; and environment issues. Also included are representatives from each State or Territory, and a nominee of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wide range of professions and expertise on Council reflects what the community sees as being of importance in health and medical issues. Further, no appointment to the Council can be made without adherence to consultative arrangements detailed in the Bill. The Minister is required to call for nominees from appropriate peak bodies or organisations, the nature of which is to be in keeping with the background and knowledge expected of the appointee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1988, the Council was chaired by the Secretary to the Commonwealth Department. Since that time, independent chairs have been appointed&mdash;first Professor John Chalmers and at present Dr Diana Horvath. I expect that this new tradition of having independent and highly distinguished chairs will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill allows for the Minister to give general directions to the Council and to refer matters to it, the Minister is expressly prevented from directing the Council in its allocation of research funding to particular persons or organisations or from directing it on scientific, technical or ethical issues. The Council has an unfettered power to publish reports on matters within its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also requires the NHMRC to prepare a triennial strategic plan, in consultation with the Minister, for tabling in parliament. The strategic plan sets out the Council's assessment of the major national health issues and describes how it proposes to perform its functions in dealing with those issues. The plan will also include a strategy for health and medical research. I hope that the occasion of tabling the Council's strategic plan each three years will enable the Parliament to have an informed debate on health in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the work of the Council is first carried out within its principal committees. The Bill allows for the creation of principal committees by the Minister on the advice of the Council and it preserves for the present the existing principal committees: the Public Health Committee, the Health Care Committee, the Medical Research and Public Health Research and Development Committees and the Australian Health Ethics Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly over recent years, the Council has been opening up its processes and procedures to public participation. For example, the twice yearly sessions of the Council are open to the media. The Bill states the intention of the Parliament that the Council, as far as practicable, adopt a policy of public consultation in relation to matters being considered by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Bill details a comprehensive consultative process for the Council to abide by when it is considering the issuing of guidelines or the making of recommendations on matters which will be implemented in State legislation. This process of public consultation reflects the highly authoritative nature of the Council's work in such areas. It will first be required to publish the fact that it is proposing to issue guidelines or make regulatory recommendations and to seek submissions and then to publish and seek comment on the draft guidelines or recommendations. The Council must produce and publish procedures to assist persons or bodies to present submissions regarding proposed recommendations or guidelines. This approach to public consultation reflects the advice of the Administrative Review Council which examined the work of the NHMRC in 1990. It is also consistent with the present practice of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also arising from the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council, the Bill prescribes that a position of Commissioner of Complaints is to be established to consider grievances relating to the disbursement of medical and health research grants. The Commissioner will not be reviewing cases on their scientific merits&mdash;it will always be the case that some good science will not be able to be funded.

<PARA>Since the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 came into effect there has been increasing recognition for the need to effectively manage the marine environment. The extent of this area is significant. The Australian fishing zone occupies a larger area than Australia itself and the Commonwealth Government is responsible for managing the majority of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marine areas differ from terrestrial areas in terms of their management requirements. The migratory nature of many marine species, the seasonal shifts in currents and nutrients, and the ease of transport of pollutants such as oil and the relatively limited knowledge we have of marine systems require that comprehensive legal and management programs be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to be included in the Bill are intended to ensure that the enforcement provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 are adequate for the purpose of protecting those marine reptiles, birds and mammals to which part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations applies, by making the powers in the Act consistent with, and no less stringent than, the enforcement powers in the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for the amendments arises from the agreement by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that it is inappropriate for management of marine mammals and marine reptiles to be under commercial fisheries legislation, and that responsibility for those animals should be transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The Fisheries Management Act specifies that the term `fish' does not include marine reptiles or marine mammals, unlike the former Fisheries Act, and it is now necessary to ensure that the provisions of the NPWC Act are adequate to protect those species of animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 71(2)(b) of the Act provides for the making of regulations for the protection and conservation of wildlife and subsection 3(1) specifies that the term `wildlife' includes animals and plants that are indigenous to the continental shelf of Australia or the superjacent waters. Those provisions of the Act are implemented through part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations, which applies in or on the continental shelf of Australia, the superjacent waters, the seabed and subsoil beneath those waters and the airspace above those waters. Part III protects specified animals and plants and provides for a licensing system administered by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. In general, a licence to kill, take, keep, sell or purchase a protected animal or protected plant may only be issued for the purpose of scientific research, educational study or non-commercial propagation. Exemptions to some of the provisions of part III apply to traditional Aboriginal hunting and to certain aspects of licensed commercial fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The animals protected under part III of the regulations are listed on schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the regulations. Currently, the groups of species covered by those schedules comprise sea snakes, seals and birds. Arrangements are in hand to add turtles, crocodiles and dugong to the schedules in the near future, through an amendment to the NPW regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With sea snakes, turtles, crocodiles, birds, seals and dugong protected by part III of the regulations, and whales and dolphins protected by the Whale Protection Act 1980, all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth waters under legislation administered by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For logistical reasons, and for efficient use of resources, enforcement of that legislation will in many cases be delegated to officers from Commonwealth or State fisheries or nature conservation agencies, who will receive appropriate appointments under the Commonwealth legislation. For example, a group of officers from the Victorian Department of Conservation and Environment has already received appointments as inspectors under the Whale Protection Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes the creation of a new category of enforcement officer with powers of enforcement able to be limited so that they apply only to offences against specific regulations in part III of the NPW regulations. The new category of enforcement officer is to be known as a wildlife inspector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because part III of the regulations and the Whale Protection Act complement each other in the protection of marine mammals, the enforcement powers available under those pieces of legislation need to be consistent. Furthermore, because the protection of such species of marine wildlife as turtles and dugong is being transferred to part III of the regulations from the former Fisheries Act, the powers of enforcement should be at least as stringent as they were under that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective enforcement requires that officers have powers to arrest without a warrant, seize evidence, and search a vehicle, aircraft or vessel in connection with an offence. Under the Whale Protection Act and the Fisheries Management Act, enforcement officers have powers of that kind. Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, however, those powers are only available to wardens in Australia and in the Australian coastal sea. Amendments proposed in the Bill are intended to extend the application of those powers to the continental shelf, so that wardens and wildlife inspectors can use those powers when enforcing part III of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to achieve consistency with the Whale Protection Act, the Bill will provide wardens and wildlife inspectors with the power to require a person in charge of a vessel to give information concerning the vessel and its crew and any person on board the vessel. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major purpose of this Bill is to end a traditional statutory marketing arrangement, which has operated for some 30 years;  and to bring government involvement in honey industry marketing under new arrangements which are more cost effective and appropriate to the marketing environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The termination of the Australian Honey Board, the transfer of functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the repeal of the marketing component of the export charge all have the support of the two representative industry organisations, the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Association and the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia. The Australian Honey Board itself endorses the proposed changes and the Australian Horticultural Corporation welcomes the honey industry to its growing list of participating industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill represents the culmination of some 14 months of negotiation and discussion among industry, the Australian  Honey Board, the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy since the then Minister Kerin announced that the Government would not be extending the Australian Honey Board beyond its legislated sunset of 11 May 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the honey industry for the cooperative and constructive manner in which it has worked, and continues to work, with the Government to implement the new marketing arrangements embodied in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision followed the Government's review of the recommendations of the Davis Review Committee on Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities in 1990. The Davis Committee reported that the smaller marketing authorities, including the Australian Honey Board, faced the problem of high operating costs relative to levy income and services provided. It recommended that consideration be given to merging the smaller marketing authorities into larger umbrella organisations, which would be able to provide a more efficient and cost effective legislative and administrative infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian honey industry is a small but very important industry with a gross value of production of about $40m, although its impact on agriculture is far greater through pollination. It exports about 40 per cent of its production. The Australian Honey Board operates on a budget of about $500,000 of which about half is absorbed in administration costs, and the Davis Committee recommendations would have added to these costs. Moreover, since the board was reconstituted under the 1988 Act, its functions had effectively reduced to generic promotion based on a limited budget and provision of information services to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The function of setting minimum export prices for bulk honey was ineffectual, with Australia's share of world trade only about one per cent and hence a price taker. Export licensing had become virtually automatic as long as the applicant had a sound business, honey available and export experience. The board had also terminated the outdated practice of appointing overseas selling agents. The industry subsequently requested that termination of the board be brought forward to 31 December 1992 on the basis that there was little reason to extend the board's life beyond the time necessary for industry to consider its future marketing options. The board itself agreed with this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry established an Australian Honey Board Review Committee to consider its options, which were to continue statutory cover under the Australian Horticultural Corporation or to go it alone backed by a voluntary levy. The review committee duly recommended the continuation of statutory marketing arrangements under the Australian Horticultural Corporation, supported by statutory levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving the honey industry's marketing arrangements under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation is expected to result in administrative savings to the industry of up to $100,000 per annum. Moreover, the apiary industry is becoming more involved in commercial pollination and the development of linkages with horticulture could facilitate this progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review committee also recommended that the marketing component of the honey export charge be repealed, which would result in a reduction of receipts of about $70,000 per annum. The rationale for the abolition of this charge is that the export promotion funded by it is largely ineffectual as this amount is too small for generic export promotion and the largest proportion of Australian honey exports is in bulk form for blending in the country of destination. Abolition of this levy will provide honey exporters, who pay the charge, with additional funds which could be more effectively used in the promotion of pre-packaged brand name exports in higher return niche markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review committee's recommendations were unanimously supported by a special general meeting of the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Association on 28 October 1991 and subsequently endorsed by the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia. As part of the process of moving the honey industry to the new marketing arrangements, a memorandum of understanding was signed on 27 February 1992 by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Association, as the organisation representing levy payers, and the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The memorandum of understanding sets out terms and conditions by which the honey industry agreed to move under the statutory cover of the Horticultural Corporation for an initial period to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to refer briefly to the essential features of the Bill. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the repeal of the Honey Marketing Act and provisions for the board's assets, liabilities and obligations to be transferred to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. All assets will be separately identified and used to the benefit of the honey industry. Any transferred liabilities will be met by the Corporation solely from transferred liquid assets or from future levies and charges raised from the honey industry. In this context I note that if for any reason the honey industry decides to leave the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation after 30 June 1995, the disposal of any net assets will be determined in a manner which benefits the honey industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also provision for the board to continue after 31 December 1992 solely for the purpose of finalising and submitting the final annual report of the board. Part 3 of the Bill makes definitional amendments to the Australian Horticultural Act to allow the honey industry to come under that Act. Transitional provisions allow honey levies and charges to be paid to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, including outstanding levies and charges. Part 4 of the Bill deals with the repeal of the marketing component of the export charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further detailed explanation is contained in the explanatory memorandum. Following passage of this Bill, regulations will be made to specify the particular functions that the Corporation will perform on behalf of the honey industry. These functions will include promotion, public relations activities, consumer education, quality assurance and information dissemination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the board members for their service to the honey industry. The board, led by the Chairman, Mr Philip Chandler, has been very effective and innovative since its appointment in 1989. It has developed and implemented a promotion strategy based on sound market research, facilitated a new era of cooperation between producers and packers, encouraged new directions in marketing, eliminated the outdated practice of appointing overseas selling agents, and moved from setting minimum export prices to a system of guideline export prices. Indeed, it could be said that its efforts have contributed to the level of industry maturity which has allowed its reduced functions to be transferred to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board has prudently managed its finances to provide for its termination and transfer of its functions. I am assured that there will be adequate funds to meet all its financial liabilities. These liabilities are principally to the staff of the board who become redundant with the termination of the board. I would also like to extend my tribute to the loyalty of the staff of four, who have served the board well for a long period. The board is exercising all care and consideration for the staff, following the guidelines established under the Australian Government Statutory Authorities Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no financial implications to the Commonwealth arising from this Bill and research and development  arrangements for the honey industry remain unchanged.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background to the foreign investment fund measures, the Australian tax system prior to 1987 was heavily biased in favour of investments in low tax countries rather than investments in Australia or comparable tax countries.

Accordingly, the Government embarked on the development of a comprehensive system for taxing foreign source income. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian residents who have invested in offshore life bonds or other foreign life policies with an investment component will also be subject to the foreign investment fund measures. The Government is firmly committed to these measures, which will close the remaining opportunities for offshore tax avoidance currently available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign investment fund measures will apply to Australian taxpayers who have an interest in a foreign company or a foreign trust. For a foreign company, these will generally be taxpayers who hold shares in the company.

Bare trusts and other types of custodial or agency relationships are excluded from the measures. </PARA>
<PARA>In designing the foreign investment fund measures, the Government has carefully targeted those non-controlling interests in foreign entities that provide the greatest scope for tax avoidance. The measures' focus is on long term interests in multitiered offshore investments that enable the deferral of Australian tax through the accumulation of low taxed income offshore, which on disposal is usually converted into concessionally taxed capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures include the following exemptions to ensure that they do not catch unintended targets. The previously announced short term holding exemption will be effectively extended by providing relief from foreign investment fund taxation in the year of disposal of a taxpayer's entire foreign investment fund interest, regardless of how long that interest has been held. The small investor exemption applies to taxpayers who are natural persons with offshore investments not exceeding $50,000. This amount was previously $20,000 but has been increased in response to taxpayer representations. This exemption has been extended to apply where the total of an investor's offshore investments and investments in resident public unit trusts do not exceed $50,000. </PARA>

The list of designated active businesses covers the vast majority of activities conducted by foreign companies. A further exemption will ensure that Australian investors have access to markets where a country prohibits direct investment on its stock exchanges. This is provided by excluding from the measures investments made direct in certain approved country funds in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extensive list of approved stock exchanges and the ability of taxpayers to use approved industrial classification systems to determine whether a foreign company is principally engaged in a designated active business will greatly reduce taxpayers' compliance costs. It has always been the Government's intention that both the list of approved stock exchanges and the list of designated active businesses would provide ample opportunity for Australians to invest in genuine active businesses, such as new technology industries or in emerging regional markets. The Government has had to strike a balance between the opportunity for Australians to invest offshore and the need to prevent tax avoidance. If there is any bias in the measures, it falls in favour of offshore investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exemption for direct holdings in foreign banks will ensure that there is no hindrance to investments in listed shares of a foreign bank, provided the bank's shares are widely held.

To obtain this exemption, an individual has to be an employee or past employee of that employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are also not intended to apply to short term residents of Australia. A specific exemption is provided in this regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Prime Minister's One Nation statement the Government announced its intention to tax income derived by offshore banking units, OBUs, from borrowing and lending to non-residents at a concessional income tax rate of 10 per cent. After extensive consultation with the banking and finance industry, the Government has decided to extend the scope of the activities, the income from which will attract the concessional tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry strongly argued that viability of an Australian offshore banking regime depended on Australia's ability to compete on an even footing with other countries in our region that already provide a broad range of concessions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OBU activities that will be subject to the new rules cover all significant transactions sought by industry, and the Government believes that they will be well received. Most of the concessional activities can be classified as either financial intermediation between non-residents, including foreign branches of Australian residents, or the provision of financial services to non-residents in respect of business that would not ordinarily have a connection with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is confident that this measure will promote the development of a viable offshore banking centre in Australia at a time when such activities are likely to be shifted from Hong Kong to elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct cost to revenue of the measures is likely to be around $30m in a full financial year from 1993-94.

<PARA>This Bill covers a number of matters, some of which are minor procedural issues. The first relates to the use of the terms `in-patient' and `patient'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, in cooperation with the States, the medical profession and the private health insurance funds, has been encouraging a move toward day surgery and day only procedures consistent with modern medical practice. To facilitate this the relevant Acts were amended in 1989 to cover day surgery procedures. An integral component of those changes involved the substitution of the term `in-patient' in the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 with the term `patient'. These changes removed the need to occupy a bed for private health insurance benefit purposes, thereby reducing the financial incentives for patients to be admitted overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the reference to `in-patient' was substituted in the definition in the National Health Act, it remains in the Health Insurance Act. The term `in-patient' still appears in error through the body of both Acts and this Bill deals with that oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no policy implication of this tidying up except in one part of the National Health Act where the term `person' was inadvertently substituted in lieu of `patient'. Technically this inadvertent change would let private health funds refuse to pay benefits for newborn babies in intensive care as they are technically not `patients' at the moment. The insurance funds understand, however, that this was an error and they are continuing to pay benefits while this change is being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains minor amendments to substitute the title of `Managing Director' for `General Manager' of the Health Insurance Commission wherever the term is used in the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Amendment Act 1991 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The change of title is in line with the titles now used by other Government business enterprises. It is simply a change in title and it does not involve any change in the terms or conditions of the chief executive of the HIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also deals with one aspect of pathology. In some cases specimens received at one laboratory will be referred to another laboratory, for example, where they require testing on equipment not available at the first laboratory. As the Act stands, collection benefits are only payable where the specimen is collected by the pathologist or his or her employees. Where a specimen is sent to the second laboratory, the collection benefit is not payable, as the staff employed by the first laboratory are not employees of the pathologist running the second laboratory. This Bill removes that anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains provisions which will repeal those sections of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991 which related to the introduction of the interactive eligibility checking system and restricted the availability of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian residents and other eligible persons as defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973. These provisions will not now come into effect because the conditions which had been inserted in the commencement provisions could not be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on 1 July 1992, new arrangements for checking eligibility to free or concessional pharmaceutical benefits will be introduced. These new arrangements relate to tighter administration of the existing legislation whereby claims that include prescriptions where the entitlement to concessional benefits is not valid will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances pharmacists will need to satisfy themselves that a person is entitled to concessional treatment. While the Government does not believe that there will be major difficulties in this, particularly as most pensioners, for example, are well known to their local pharmacist, there may be some cases where a person who is entitled to concessional treatment&mdash;that is, currently paying up to $2.60 versus the up to $15.70 amount applying to general patients&mdash;has to pay the general patient rate at the time of dispensing. Where such an event occurs and the patient can satisfy the HIC that he or she is entitled to the concessional rate there needs to be a power for the HIC to provide a refund. This Bill includes that power. This amendment will have effect from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further change removes a technical difficulty with the definition of `approved pharmacist'. While State and Territory laws now prevent a person who is not a pharmacist from owning a pharmacy, this was not always the case. A number of pharmacies which are owned by non-pharmacists are currently operating under `grandfather' clauses. In these cases it was the practice to approve a pharmacist manager `for and on behalf' of the non-pharmacist owner; however, in accordance with recent legal advice it is now proposed to deem non-pharmacist owners, where this complies with State laws, as pharmacists for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes provision to allow for the approval of suppliers to supply pharmaceutical benefits to be cancelled where it is clear that the supplier has ceased to supply pharmaceutical benefits, without having to wait for the approval to be inactive for six months before it can be cancelled. The other existing provisions which safeguard against inappropriate cancellation remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes amendments to sections 4 and 5 of the Hearing Services Act 1991 that will further define `eligible persons' under the Act. The effect of these amendments will be that persons who are not Australian citizens nor Australian permanent residents will not be eligible for hearing services provided by the Commonwealth through the resources of Australian Hearing Services. It has come to the Government's attention that the amendment proposed by clause 33 of the Bill will have the unintentional effect of removing provision for ministerial determination of classes of persons, who might not be Australian citizens nor Australian permanent residents, for example, refugees, to be eligible persons under the Act. The Government recognises that there might well be such classes of persons to whom the Government has a moral obligation and, accordingly, undertakes to introduce an appropriate amendment to this part of the Bill during the Budget sittings. The Bill also amends section 66 of the Hearing Services Act to extend the protection provided in that section to the statutory name `Australian Hearing Services'. I commend the Bill to the House.

<PARA>The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island the opportunity to vote in Federal elections.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal flows from the Government's response to a recommendation from the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into the legal regimes of the external Territories. The Committee recommended that Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island be given the right of optional enrolment for the purposes of representation in the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to make the enrolment facility optional recognises that there are historical reasons which make Norfolk Island a unique case. It also recognises the basic democratic rights of those Australian citizens who do wish to vote but are currently denied the opportunity of doing so. As honourable members would be aware, the Government's decision to adopt this recommendation and, in particular, the proposal to attach Norfolk Island to the Division of Canberra for electoral purposes created some controversy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal advice available to the Government was that the Constitution would not permit the residents of an external Territory to vote in other than an electoral division of a mainland Territory. It was on this basis, and the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission, that the decision was taken to attach Norfolk Island to the Division of Canberra. However, the Norfolk Island Government is vigorously opposed to the attachment of the island to any single mainland electorate as it is felt that this would lead to a loss of identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the legal and constitutional issues involved in this proposal have now been resolved. Following intensive negotiations, agreement has been reached with the Norfolk Island Government as to the basis upon which eligible Norfolk Island residents will vote in future Federal elections. The arrangement is based on the existing itinerant voter provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Bill provides that Norfolk Islanders who can establish a relevant connection with a State subdivision can enrol in that subdivision. Those who cannot establish such a connection may enrol in a particular Territory division, currently the Division of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, consequential on the amendments to the Electoral Act, to allow those Norfolk Islanders who take up the option to enrol to participate in referendums as required by section 128 of the Constitution. I am pleased that this contentious issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of both governments and that in future it will be possible for Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island to exercise their full democratic rights, but in a manner which takes account of the unique historical circumstances of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also seeks to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to change the reference to `travelling expenses', as used in section 56, to `travelling allowances'. Section 56 provides a mechanism for authorising the payment of travelling expenses to judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court as may be approved by the Governor-General from time to time. The expression `travelling expenses' is somewhat narrower than the usual provisions dealing with travel-related entitlements. It has therefore been decided to amend the section to bring it more into line with the wording of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, which refers to `travelling allowances'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to remedy a problem created with respect to the definition of `carrier' appearing in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The current definition of `carrier', which was inserted in the Interception Act by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1991&mdash;the Transitional Act&mdash;refers to carriers licensed under the Telecommunications Act 1991. From the commencement of that definition in the Interception Act on 1 July 1991 until the coming into force of licences issued to carriers by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) under section 57 of the Telecommunications Act, the corporations which became subject to those licences, which at the time were Telecom, OTC and Aussat, did not fall within the Interception Act's definition of `carrier'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, there is some doubt about the authority conferred by warrants under the Interception Act to intercept communications during that period. There were in fact a number of warrants issued and executed during that period, and information intercepted under those warrants would in due course be relied on in prosecutions for serious offences. Since the Government is concerned</PARA>
<PARA>at the possibility that any such prosecutions might fail simply because of a technical defect with the operation of the provisions in the Transitional Act, it has acted, with the understanding of the Opposition and the Democrats, to ensure that there is legislation in place to remedy the problems before the prosecutions commence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Bill seeks to do two things. First, it continues in operation during the relevant period of the Interception Act's definitions of `carrier' and `Corporation', meaning Telecom, that were in force immediately prior to the relevant period. Secondly, it applies the new definition of `carrier' provided for by the Transitional Act immediately after the relevant period. The Bill does these things in a way which will ensure that the operation of the Interception Act's substantive provisions relating to the issue and execution of warrants may be taken to have continued in a seamless way throughout the period between 1 July 1991 until the coming into force of the carrier licences granted by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications on 22 November 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter comes before the House at very short notice, the Telecommunications (Interception&mdash;Carriers) Bill 1992 having been introduced into the Senate at very short notice. The reason is, as has been disclosed by the second reading speech, that it has become apparent, as a result of legislative change, that there may be difficulties for an interregnum period in relation to the operation of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The difficulty that arises is that when the Telecommunications (Translation Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 amended the definition of `carrier' in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and other legislation, it meant that the Interception Act applied to carriers thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 July 1991, when the amendment commenced, until 26 November 1991, a licence as a general carrier was not issued to Telecom. So it meant that there was effectively an interregnum between July and November when Telecom obviously was operating as a carrier but did not comply with the technical formality of holding that licence. As a result, it could have been said that under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, which authorised interceptions in relation to carriers, the interceptions were not done in accordance with the Act because they were done on an organisation which undoubtedly was operating as a carrier but which did not possess a formal licence for that five-month period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is not a matter that is clear because it could, nonetheless, have been argued that Telecom was a carrier and that the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 would apply to Telecom notwithstanding the fact that the formality of the general licence had not been complied with. No doubt, if it had arisen it would have been a matter of fertile argument in any court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was approached by the Government&mdash;once it was aware of this and once it was disclosed that this possible technical defect could have arisen and could have taken some argument in relation to prosecutions which are now on foot&mdash;to see whether it would consent to an amendment in the terms of this Bill which would take away any doubt over the matter and would leave it free to the prosecution to rely upon evidence obtained through interception from Telecom during that five-month period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the fact that there were outstanding prosecutions which would rely upon such evidence, and in view of the fact that if it were a defect at all it would be a highly technical defect, the Opposition came to the conclusion that it is justified to pass this Bill to remedy any defect, if it exists&mdash;I underline that it is not necessarily conceded that it did exist&mdash;to ensure those trials were not interrupted, that justice could proceed in the courts, and that law enforcement was not stopped by this possible technical defect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the Opposition has cooperated in allowing this Bill to be brought in at such short notice and in allowing the passage of this Bill to ensure that that period of interregnum is adequately covered by the legislation and the time of the courts is not detained on that technical argument, nor is evidence that ought to be admissible in a court of law struck out as a result of that potential argument. </PARA>

There was a range of amendments and many of them did not get full and complete consideration because of the guillotine in the Senate.

I shall simply take from it, or identify parts in it, which are different from the second reaching speech that was incorporated in the Senate. My intention is to identify some differences, table the speech, and then foreshadow a few amendments that the Government intends to move to the Bill as it has appeared from the Senate. I shall, however, table this document for posterity's assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one point of difference between this document and the second reading speech in the Senate was that there was, in the Senate document, reference made to R-rated material being barred by technical devices. That whole section has been removed. That is partly due to a piece of amendment mayhem by the Opposition, which I will discuss a bit later. There is, of course, a clause in the Bill that refers to a free transponder for the ABC. None of that appears in this second reading speech. That is because there will be a few appropriate remarks by me on that subject. It has no particular place in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though there was reference to it in the second reading speech in the Senate, we have also deleted from the Bill clause 198 which had reference to aspects of the ABA's rights of investigation. There was some view, and a perfectly ludicrous amendment was moved, that this would give access to journalists' notebooks. We had to move in and clean up that particular amendment, which we did to some extent by way of deletion. I table a document that has those similarities to that earlier Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in Question Time today, the Opposition has made a gigantic botch-up of a whole range of amendments to this most important piece of legislation. The Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reads like a Monty Python script. The Opposition's policy on the run was thrown together the night before this Bill was debated in the Senate; yet it had an initial draft of the Bill for six months. The final Bill was introduced three weeks ago. Of almost 100 amendments introduced into the Senate by the Opposition, only eight got through, and that was because very few of them made sense. Those that went through, however, were wrong and must now be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment that the Opposition thought would protect journalists' notebooks would have meant that judges could be put in gaol for asking journalists to disclose confidential sources&mdash;a dramatic revolutionary action against the judicial class, which I am not sure all members on this side of the House would necessarily disapprove of, but nevertheless not a terribly responsible way for the national Parliament to behave. The Opposition, indeed, put it at the wrong end of the Bill. The Government had to move its own amendment subsequently in the Senate to clean that one up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment from the Opposition in the Senate which actually passed&mdash;we will have to do something about it&mdash;was supposed to ban R-certificate material. It in fact has the effect of lifting the requirement for equipment necessary to stop children getting access to R-rated material on pay TV. Government amendment No. 3, which will be before the House later on today, is absolutely essential to clear up that mess. If we are to take the Opposition's position literally, it will absolutely forbid parents stopping their children viewing R-rated material, and this would indeed be unfortunate for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to give the ABC a free transponder for pay TV are, in our view, similarly ill considered. Government amendments Nos 1 and 2 will fix that. But let me say from the outset that the Government has demonstrated its support for ABC involvement in pay TV. The difference between us and the Opposition in what we want to do is on sensible commercial grounds. We are prepared to give the ABC $12.5m to participate in a licence. We also amended the ABC Act last night to allow it to participate in this new industry. We will give the ABC an opportunity to play if it wants to, but we will give it that opportunity in a manner which will ensure that it continues to deliver its charter responsibility free to all Australians. We are doing that because we are proud of the ABC and we will defend it. It would appear that the last thing that the Opposition wants to do is to protect its interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said during Question Time, `I think the Opposition here is just itching to have a crack at the national broadcaster'. It made that pretty clear. The intention is to chop $50m from its budget. That would be just the beginning. That is a pretty poisoned chalice that the Opposition has offered Aunty as far as that is concerned. It would definitely kill off a national institution with regional capacity that has brought news, information programs, Australian drama and comedy programs to millions of Australians for 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget all those people in the bush for whom the ABC has been a lifeline. Normally one would make points here about the National Party's traditional role in defending the interests of the bush, but we have seen enough over the last couple of years to indicate that that is the furthest thing from the mind of the National Party these days, so supporting a set of propositions which mean effectively that all ABC regional services will be cut off is of a piece with everything else that the National Party has managed to choose. </PARA>

Awarding the ABC that transponder and telling it to get on with it would surely require those two things. If it has to do it on its own, it will need capital investment of somewhere between $400m and $800m and all sorts of things related to the marketing. The ABC's annual budget is about $500m, which puts it in a position where it would have to be enormously additionally resourced. If it did not do that and it simply went into it on the present basis, we would be handing an enormous free kick to its commercial partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the other networks and all the people who own newspapers have to compete like nothing on earth and run around the town to get themselves into transponder No. 5, but anybody who manages to slip quietly into the back pocket of the old ABC, which invariably is the dominant investment partner because the others would never have the capacity to have such resources, would get a free lunch or a partially free lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to deal with that problem, which says that the Government has to sell the six available pay TV transponders in a price based competitive process, would be excised.

We also agree that the ABA should conduct Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative research on community attitudes in relation to classifications for pay TV. However, last night the Opposition incorporated an amendment that purported to use the current free to air television standard for pay TV banning R material. The banning of that material would reduce the attractiveness of pay TV and deny viewers access to mainstream blockbuster movies such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Godfather</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxi Driver</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Apocalypse Now</EMPHASIS>, even Australia's own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Don's Party</EMPHASIS> and, from my point of view, an old favourite, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</EMPHASIS>. Adults can freely see these in cinemas and rent or buy the videos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unamended Bill provides that the Office of Film and Literature Classification standards apply to programs on pay TV. It further provides in part 6, section 10 of schedule 2 for a ban on X-rated material and for a restriction on access to R-rated material by a disabling device acceptable to the ABA. The Government is satisfied that these measures would provide all the necessary community safeguards while still allowing subscribers access to movies that the community has already decided are acceptable and freely available through other outlets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, in the zeal to censor pay TV, an amendment was moved last night that does not serve the purpose. It lifts the requirement for disabling devices to be fitted to satellite receivers, which would restrict access to R-rated material. I do not think that was the intention of the Opposition and the Democrats. The Government would not want this consequence to reflect the intention of the Senate. Therefore, the Government proposes to accept amendment No. 3, which will be before the House, which has the effect of banning the carriage of R-rated material on pay TV until after the completion of an ABA hearing into community attitudes in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that about some of the Opposition amendments, I conclude my remarks with a few notes of thanks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will start on a positive note and thank the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) for his complimentary remarks. I think it is probably a mark of the complexity of broadcasting legislation that the Minister ended up talking about dogs. I acknowledge&mdash;and have done on many occasions&mdash;that the existing broadcasting legislation could probably be correctly described as a dog's breakfast; it really is a complicated piece of legislation. It is something that needs to be attended to, and that is the intention of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly speaking, we have indicated that we find much of the legislation heading in the direction in which we would want it to do. It is the first major attempt to rewrite broadcasting legislation in 50 years, and it recognises the rapid changes in transmission technologies, the convergence of broadcasting and telecommunications and the globalisation of communications generally. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is at the table, and I have had many debates and discussions in this chamber about those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regulatory structures and mechanisms were based upon restricted entry to a scarce resource and are no longer appropriate. Broadly, the Bill establishes a completely new regime, a new broadcasting authority, which is less intrusive and also less inclined to require the lengthy process of regulatory control that has provided a feast for lawyers rather than the opportunity for an efficient delivery of services, which ought to be the approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly speaking, the Opposition has found much of the Bill to its liking. But we find ourselves in a rather extraordinary position. The legislation&mdash;and it has been through a long gestation period&mdash;came to the Parliament, was subject at the last moment to some dramatic changes and intervention by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others. Those changes dealt with a significant area of the Bill regarding pay television, which I will come to directly. That intervention meant that the Bill had to be delayed. Subsequently, it has been forced down the parliamentary path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill originated in the Senate, so the initial debate was in the Senate rather than in this chamber. The debate in the Senate was under guillotine, so the opportunity for detailed consideration was not available. Indeed, tonight there is extreme pressure on us to complete the discussions here, because again the primary decisions on key elements of this Bill are to be made in the Senate. So we will have to wait until the message goes from this place to the Senate for the result of particular amendments, some of which the Minister has referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister at the table that whilst we have heard a lot of rhetoric from the Prime Minister and others today&mdash;and indeed from the Minister tonight&mdash;a broader issue has to be addressed, and that is the issue that I was making at the commencement of my remarks. It is quite clear that broadcasting and telecommunications is on the verge of major change. We cannot accept that a piece of legislation such as this can ignore that fact. We have to take stock of the existing arrangements and institutions in this country and see whether or not the structure that the Government is proposing for a new industry&mdash;and that particularly is what pay television is, a new industry&mdash;is reflective of the likely impact of technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had from the Government several proposals, particularly in the pay TV area, about what the structure might be. There have been arguments about percentages of free to air commercial networks' involvement; arguments about&mdash;we are having one tonight&mdash;whether the ABC should be involved and how that might be done; and levels of foreign ownership. Many of us have been spending quite a considerable amount of time on a whole range and cocktail of interests, some with the assistance of extensive resources and some without such elaborate resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast amount of the drafting work for the debate in the Senate&mdash;and we did move a considerable number of amendments; I think about 100&mdash;was done by the person who actually drafted the Bill, and I think that fact ought to be noted. Whilst it is always fun to say that particular amendments have been wanting and so on, there are issues that have to be addressed on the run, and they certainly have been in this debate. In proposed amendment No. 3 that the Government moved there was an intent that did not reflect itself clearly in the amendment. That is why the Government has brought the matter here. We, of course, would be supporting that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to the Minister that in the Senate last night, when this whole issue of Rs and Xs was raised, the intent of the amendment was to give effect to the recommendation of the Reynolds committee, which was brought down the day before the debate started. When the amendment was first put, there was a vote and the Government won. Then some people from the Democrats indicated that they would have preferred to have voted the other way, and we had the extraordinary situation of a call for a recommittal of the vote. I have never seen it in our part of the chamber. The vote on the same amendment was put again. The result was 32:30 in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the point not to reflect on anyone's competence but just to say to the Government that these issues are complex. I think that one of the things the Government has learnt in dealing with these complex issues is that to try to make decisions about them on the run is not the best way to go when we are talking about the establishment of a new industry and the impact on broadcasting generally. If we make decisions about radio, new narrow-casting services and commercial television on the run, we get some of the results that we talked about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that in my Party&mdash;and I am sure that it is the same for the Government&mdash;when we start talking about digital compressed video and what happens in interactive services and so on, it takes a bit of work to explain the impacts of MDS and the various technological options. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I did notice that the Prime Minister was bragging about how everyone in the Labor Party knows, but I have to say that the basis to the second reading amendment indicates to the Government what our view is about the structure that it has proposed. I will make some comments about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address a couple of the points that the Opposition raised in the Senate last night, the reservations that we had and some of the results to give some indication of what took place and some of the policy decisions that underpin the Opposition's approach. We took the view that there were limitations with respect to the satellite&mdash;which is yet to be launched and will provide the initial service&mdash;in that it would not cover all Australians. A detailed proposal has been put to the Government by Optus, the satellite carrier, the people that purchased Aussat to become the second telecommunications carrier, about how we might be piggybacking services and covering remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put an amendment last night and the Government agreed to that amendment. It recognised that an understanding of the technology was not there when it first considered the matter and that subsequent expert advice indicated that it might be possible to take that signal to all Australians. The Government supported the amendment. I thought that was a constructive position to take and I hope that the Government is going to fulfil the intent of that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked about trying to ensure that viewers are protected, and we moved to require that a code of practice be developed by pay TV operators in dealings with their customers about billing and privacy and all those sorts of matters. It is very important that we put viewers' interests first rather than the views of putative proprietors of these services. That amendment was also accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that there is no code of practice, or that a code of practice has failed, it is now required by an amendment that the ABA must determine the standard. I think at the end of the day in an increasingly fragmented telecommunications-broadcasting market, we are going to be concerned in this place more about standards and content, not the method by which the message might be carried or delivered. That ought to be a matter for those in the market place. They assess the customer to be serviced and deliver to the homes of viewers a much broader menu of programs by a variety of different means. We take the view that that ought not to be constrained in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved another interesting amendment which can be described as a consumer issue, and it rather surprised me that it was not taken up by the Government. Whichever structure we talk about for pay TV&mdash;our preferred structure is five independent separate licences and one for the ABC&mdash;there should be a standardised approach to customer reception equipment. We propose that that be the case for a period of three years, which would take us up to the edge of the impact of digital compressed video. That is an issue that is of keen interest to the industry, and it surprised me that the Government did not find that attractive as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a series of amendments concerning radio. The radio industry is very important to this country, as all would acknowledge, but there are some unintended consequences of the Act that visited some injustices on existing radio operators in the regime where there is a conversion from AM to FM. The effect would be to create an AM ghetto. We would be locking people into AM, not able to get into FM and convert if their application were unsuccessful. This is all being done with on-the-horizon DAB&mdash;digital audio broadcasting&mdash;about to arrive, which will give us CD quality radio signals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved amendments, as did the Government, to try to correct those situations. I would defy anyone to sit down and go through this in detail and give a five-minute exposition which everyone could understand. I think I have the general thrust of it, and I have argued the case on their behalf quite forcefully for some time, but in the end the Government did agree. I think that was also the product of a reasoned debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved another amendment that provided for the protection of children from program material that might be detrimental and harmful to them. I think all of us would agree with that position. Last night the Government did not support that general principle amendment. I was surprised that it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters I want to raise is the question of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. The Minister will well remember that that Committee was established at the tail end of the Telco debate because there was an attempt there to make Austel, the independent competition and industry regulator, a morals regulator. I had the strong personal view that that was not appropriate. The Committee was proposed, and at the time of drafting its terms of reference I also proposed that we include the question of the content of pay TV, knowing that significant members of the community, and indeed members and senators, were concerned about those issues. There was an opportunity for a public inquiry and the Committee brought down a majority report. The Democrats, the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and Independent Senator Harradine, who has been very active in these areas, put down a recommendation which was picked up in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to address this issue in a constructive fashion, and I think we have. The next matter was that the ABC has, in principle, been accepted as a pay TV player. This is the matter that is going to cause continuing debate and concern. We would obviously be dividing against Government amendment No. 2 in relation to clauses 94 and 95. I should like to talk about the ABC and some of the misrepresentations in the Minister's own remarks and, indeed, rather outrageously by the Prime Minister today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, one has to understand that the decision the Government took about its structure provides for $12m for the ABC to bid in a consortium. That is recognition of the in-principle acceptance that the ABC ought to be treated like the commercial free to airs, being able to migrate into a new, emerging like industry, giving entertainment and information, and that it ought to be able to migrate into that new technological opportunity. I take the view, as does my Party, that if the Government is to deny that opportunity it is going to allow the ABC to wither on the vine. That is not our intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government might make the connection with the $50m&mdash;a lot has been made of that&mdash;but the Minister knows, as I do, that the Government has to reduce the outlays to the ABC over a period of time in real terms. That is a decision that all governments have to make; and we have made those decisions. We are doing it up front, openly, and in discussion with the ABC. The ABC does not like it; we would expect an institution such as the ABC to fight for what it can. I do not deny the ABC the opportunity to do that, although I would rather do it quietly in my own room than read the somewhat vociferous comments from some within the ABC. That is a debate that will continue between us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government is asking for a 10 per cent reduction in overall outlays, I think that is to a degree that is not achievable within the current recessionary climate. But that does not mean that one does not support the ABC. That is a leap in logic that defies a rational explanation. We have to address this broader issue about whether or not, in allowing commercial television to migrate into pay television, we also allow the national broadcaster to do so. The Government has made that in principle decision by indicating that it will provide the ABC with cash to bid. We are saying that we think this can be done another way. We think the way we are proposing is more realistic to the achievement of the ABC being involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of us will yell and scream about how much we appreciate the ABC and its cultural impact and so on, and indeed we do, but this is not an argument about that. The argument is about how we place the ABC in a position where it can participate in the commencement of a new broadcasting industry. That is what this is: a new broadcasting industry. There are immense assets within the national broadcaster; it is under pressure because of the financial circumstances of this nation. But there is no diminution in the support given for the principles that underpin the ABC as an independent broadcaster, a promoter of Australian culture, programming and so on. We say that this is a better way to chart a course for the future involvement of the ABC which will have the greater likelihood of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has been long prosecuting its potential role in pay TV. It knows that with the fragmentation of the market, the rapid increase in the impact of technology and the multiplicity of service delivery systems, it needs to be there to be relevant in the long term broadcasting landscape in this country. The ABC has prosecuted this case and it has provided the Government, and to a lesser extent the Opposition, with its proposals. But the centrepiece of the ABC's proposals to date, this concept of consortium that it has been talking about, which is the basis to what we are putting forward, is that it is not going to be requiring funds from us in terms of recurrent expenditure. Remember, subscription television is a service to which revenues are generated, and the ABC will be providing that as a commercial service. It will be encouraging people to invest&mdash;passive investors. It had a range of potential Australian investors when it put forward its Galaxy proposal here, interestingly and ironically, on the very day that the Prime Minister made his unbelievable, off the top of the head announcement with regard to the changed structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the ABC is asking to become involved without the provision of additional funds, and of course that is the direction in which we would want to go. We say that this is the one-off opportunity for this to be achieved. It is regrettable that in the amending process the principle is now enshrined in this Act and the opportunity to address some of the more detailed matters, which would be left to a Minister in a licensing process, is the basis upon which the Government is now saying that we reject the principle, we reject the opportunity, and we are, in effect, going to put the ABC at the end of the queue and not let it have the opportunity to be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of the Prime Minister today were more a political response, trying to carve out some position to protect himself from the obvious charge from so many who have been looking and thinking about the long term changes that are happening in broadcasting. To describe it as just an attempt to privatise the ABC on the sly, or to see the withering away of the ABC's free to air television operation, is so much rhetoric and so lacking in substance that it ought to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is going to be, as there has been in other pay TV cable markets, particularly in the United States, a drift of audience away from free to air into these new services that are emerging. We have to remember that Australia is coming to pay TV 10 years late. Other jurisdictions have had pay TV for a long time; we have been contemplating it for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are on the threshold of commencing a new industry and there has not been a debate about the future of the public broadcaster. The Government is dismissing it out of hand. It is not recognising the potential for the broader range of complementary services that an ABC pay TV service can provide; the greater scope it may well give to ABC free to air television for the promotion of the education and open university systems that are running now&mdash;and we are all surprised at how popular and well used they are&mdash;the opportunity for greater use of parliamentary broadcasting capacity, whether or not it be on the proposed sixth channel. These things have not been taken into account by the Government in reaching some of the decisions that underpin this Bill and in its approach to the in-principle amendment we have moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC's involvement is not a central issue, but it is a very important issue and one that I personally feel the Government has not given the consideration it ought to have. Certainly the Prime Minister's making on the run decisions is something that he and many in his Party and at least several in the Ministry regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other points I should make about pay television, because that is the issue at the centre of this Bill. There have been reports that the structure the Government is proposing&mdash;a four-transponder initial service&mdash;will not be successful because people will be looking more to the fifth and sixth transponders. I have had the same representations as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has had, and indeed the Democrats, about whether or not this structure will work. I think it is a structure that has problems, but I believe there are significant interests there who see that there is an opportunity. However, the structure is inferior because it is inherently contradictory. It tries in part to be more competitive than that which was proposed by Senator Richardson, but with the continued restraints on foreign ownership involvement and the moratorium on advertising, which we moved in the Senate to be removed, and the 12 months phase-in period for the first licensee, I do not believe it is a purely competitive position that we can support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the basis upon which we proposed the more open system, with an initial offering of five individual and separate licences. During that process we would perhaps consider the bundling of one or two transponders. We believe that initially there is significant interest in pay television and that would be an equal starting position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could then address the industry issues, and I refer to the similar customer reception equipment amendment we proposed as being a better model to consider. That model has not enjoyed the support of the Government to this point and it has not enjoyed the support of the Democrats, who are really going 100 miles an hour in a different direction, requiring a seven-year restricted period for the entry of any other competitors. That leaves the debate in a very interesting position, but focusing back on whether or not the ABC should be involved, and I have outlined broadly the approach we would take to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision making processes of the Government in coming to the final Broadcasting Services Bill that we are now debating give a lot of us not only in this place but also in the broad marketplace some cause to pause. Those who listened carefully to what the Prime Minister said when he made his ground-shattering announcement, and again today, understand that some of these issues about the structure are driven more by politics than by the long term interests and development of the public broadcasting assets in this country as well as of current and future commercial operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is going to be driven by the prospect of short term political gain when considering such a momentous piece of legislation which has so many positive impacts, then I think one has to question the bona fides of the Prime Minister. I particularly personalise it to the Prime Minister. In the almost eight years that I have been a member of this chamber, I have spent a lot of time involved in our communications committee. Every time one of these issues arises, it is amazing how the Prime Minister always seems to emerge as being a central player. We can go back to the aggregation debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Minister that the people in the Department of Transport and Communications with whom I have dealt with in this matter have an intellectual grasp of some of these issues that is impressive. The draftsman of this Bill has done a good job under very difficult circumstances. All of us would want broadcasting to benefit from the labours of so many. Politics in the communication field has, yet again, intervened. That is particularly regrettable. I think we have been constructive, and the raw politics demonstrated by the Prime Minister today was shameful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the amendment that gives effect to the matters I spoke about earlier, and that is to make it clear that the intention of the Senate was that, concerning R programs on pay television, effect will be given to the decision by the committee in the Senate that on Tuesday reported into telecommunications and broadcasting that there was not sufficient material to determine whether or not R programs should be available on the potential pay TV service. The Bill provides that X-rated material not be shown on the service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this amendment intends to do is to require the ABA&mdash;the successor in title to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal&mdash;to conduct an early inquiry into whether or not R classified programs ought to be available and what the impact on viewers of those programs would be. The intention is that the ABA, or the ABT, conduct an early inquiry with extensive research on those matters and that it report and make its findings. Those findings are subject to the disallowance provisions in the Bill relating to standards and a Minister may direct the ABA concerning that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the Minister will move at an early time to ensure that this inquiry commences. Indeed, already in the ABT a classifications inquiry is about to commence, and that also would have some bearing on this matter. Therefore, this amendment is important to significant numbers of Australians. It is important that these matters be dealt with. I stress that it does not say that `there shall be for all time no R-rated material on pay TV.' It simply says that, before that decision is made, we must have a much longer and more significant inquiry as to the detail and the potential impact of these types of services. It is proper and right that this be so. As I said, this amendment follows the recommendation of the special committee chaired by Senator Reynolds which found, by a majority, that this should be the course of action that proceeds. Therefore, we accept the amendment to the schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the House is in the strange process of being caught in a dilemma with the Senate over the progress of legislation amending the Broadcasting Act 1992. The Senate has moved a number of far-sighted and generally supportive amendments to this legislation, and the Government has chosen to dig in its heels in a way that I think is unconscionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has entered into a contract with Optus to supply services from 1 October 1992. The urgency of this debate has been brought about because the Government cannot renege on that contract. But the Government, by fooling around, wasting time and not being able to expose to the Parliament the full wishes of its intentions, has created circumstances where there is disagreement in the Parliament about whether the Houses will accept its amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Services Bill is broad and sweeping. It is an historic Bill which goes to the very heart of broadcasting in Australia. It seeks to break, and indeed it does break, broadcasting history, because there is not an aspect of broadcasting in this nation that is not affected by that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some idea of the scope of the legislation. It touches on national broadcasting services, both the ABC and the SBS; it touches on commercial broadcasting services, that is, the existing radio and television industry; it touches on community broadcasting services&mdash;services currently operated by community broadcasting groups; it touches on subscription of broadcasting services, or pay television, by satellite, which has a national audience and which is an innovation for the Australian people and something that the Australian people want but which at this point is not legislated for; and it touches on subscription narrow-casting, that is, the targeting of audiences by way of restricted access to the receiving equipment or by encryption. The legislation also deals with the open narrow-casting services to target audiences without encryption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total aspect of broadcasting in Australia is touched on by that legislation, which came from the Senate and was raced through this House, went back to the Senate and was basically rejected by it, and came back here. The Government has refused to accept most of the Senate's amendments. We have adopted a process in the last few minutes whereby the Opposition has stated its disagreement with the Government. The legislation has gone, at this late hour, back to the Senate for it to determine what should happen to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, being the House that it is, likes to take time and examine in detail the ramifications of legislation. The Senate in this instance has been forced under the guillotine to shortcut its deliberations, simply because the Government has a requirement to meet a contract; simply because the Government wants to ram these massive changes through the Australian Parliament. The Government is not prepared to consider in a measured way proposals for change or modification to its Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that, since the legislation was first talked about and discussed in public, four Ministers for Transport and Communications have been responsible for the passage of this legislation, policy areas and policy development. We have had Ministers Beazley, Kerin, Richardson and now Minister Collins. The Government has had four guys playing around with this thing, and they have all succeeded Minister Duffy, who said way back that there would be no pay television before the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that point, set long ago by Minister Duffy when he was Transport and Communications Minister, we have had four successive Ministers, all with different points of view. In the last few days, the most recent Minister has been rolled by the Prime Minister. He knew nothing about the changes and the formulae put in place by the Prime Minister. We even had the unedifying spectacle of the cockney larrikin who is in charge of the ABC coming here to try to settle the matter in a physical way with the Prime Minister in the Prime Minister's office. David Hill came to the Parliament and disagreed with the Prime Minister. We have back street brawlers getting to it instead of resolving the matter in a sensible way. Both of those people then came before the media the following day and said there was nothing in it. The fact of the matter is that there is a lot in it, because this is landmark legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The personnel, how they operate&mdash;all of those factors need to be known. In fact, the legislation seeks to provide a more simple regulatory regime, irrespective of the mechanisms of delivery. It does, however, categorise into a series of layers every aspect of broadcasting to which different regulations and, to a degree, different rules apply. The Government has stratified all of this broadcasting process. It has put a body in charge of it which will oversee and regulate the lot on behalf of the Australian community. Even those few decisions on their own are landmark decisions. Yet the Government is prepared to ram through the legislation under guillotine in the Senate, have a flick of a debate here and try to abuse the Parliament and the Australian people by not considering fully the ramifications of the legislation for broadcasting in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, community standards are very high indeed. Individual licensing is critical to commercial television and commercial broadcasting services. It is critical to the way in which community broadcasting services will operate and the type of community broadcasting we will have. The legislation introduces, for the first time, price competition in the allocation of new broadcasting services. That is something that will be endorsed by both sides of the Parliament. But the point about the innovation of pay television is that there is not the same imperative with regard to commercial attitudes and competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not allow the ABC into that area. The ABC has said that it can raise the funds that it needs on the market; there is no demand on the Budget. It can go for its transponder and it can do the job. It can provide a service that the people of Australia want. But the Prime Minister came in here and bagged that process by saying that allowing the ABC to have a transponder to enable it to go into pay television and to provide services which many Australians want will cause a demand on the Budget and will be a cost to the Government. That is denied by the ABC, and the ABC has put together what I believe is a responsible package which will allow it to enter the new market. It has adopted a commercial attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another thing that has been rejected by the Prime Minister. He has rejected the concept that the ABC should be allowed to go into pay television in a commercial sense. He claims that that will affect the outlook and, ultimately, white-ant and destroy the ABC. Nothing could be more remote from the facts of the matter. The ABC is going into a new area where the skills and the market are quite different from those in free to air broadcasting. The ABC has great ability in free to air broadcasting, but this is a new area. It will be a learning process for all entrants. Some are more expert than others. The ABC has a good track record and commercial operators have similar track records. The ABC knows about the sorts of technicalities it will be getting involved in. It knows the cost factors and it wants the challenge. But the Government will not let it take up the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will let the mates out there have a go. It will let the first four set up the market and then it will let the mates come in to scoop the pool. That is the way it will work. That is the talk around the commercial whirl in the capital cities. People know the set-up; they know about the agreements that the Labor Party has decided on. Why do those opposite not become fair dinkum in this area? From the day that Peter Westerway was appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, those opposite have played games and favourites with the media of Australia, seeking to gain a personal political advantage in every decision they have taken. Every time it has been a case of mates first, friends first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who will be advantaged by this process? If people are friends of the Australian Labor Party one can see that, despite the challenges of the back bench committees and despite one Minister saying, `This is not right', eventually, strange as it may seem&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;at the end of the day those friends will come out on top. This is exactly what will happen with pay television. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can probably name three or four most significant decisions, including allowing people to go illegal and then making them legal retrospectively; and jacking up the value of television stations in Australia by hinting at networking, allowing people to consolidate their network and then legalising the process. These things have happened one after another, and they often just happen to occur within the six months prior to an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another surprise is why the owners of those commercial stations are locked into government decisions. That is wrong also. Let there be competition, let there be fairness out there and let the Australian people win for once. Let them be able to judge the merits of broadcasters by what the broadcasters do with their programs and what they do with those valuable licences that are issued on behalf of the Australian people by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and, subsequently, by the new Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our side of the House endorses some of the changes. The providing of automatic licence renewal is a welcome innovation. The practice of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal trying, by inquisition, licensees on every occasion that their licences became due was a crazy one. We saw minority groups trying to halt the process of the Tribunal and the Tribunal actually becoming incapable of managing its affairs because of the activities of minority groups. The ABA will have the chance to go in and do something about any serious claims and matters of deep concern. I endorse that. There should not be disruption and uncertainty, provided that a licensee is fulfilling his or her obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suitability test for people who hold licences is an admirable and acceptable approach. In relation to commercial broadcasting the Government has taken the decision that, rather than the percentage of ownership, it will go behind the veil of percentages and look at who exactly does control what&mdash;who pulls the strings in commercial radio and television. That also is significant because, whilst a person may appear to be at arm's length to an organisation by a series of front companies or where funds have been attracted from for investment, the control may be a hidden control. So who pulls the strings is most significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention of the 20 per cent foreign ownership is a limit on commercial television networks. With regard to the increases in the television audience limit of 60 per cent to 70 per cent, the Government is toying with the thing. Why does it not go to 100 per cent and take some of the other brakes off? That is a stupid limitation. It has little or no effect. It might as well be 100 per cent, and I find it strange that the Australian Labor Party could not bring itself to take the full bite and enter into proper competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that there are still so many questions out there. I cannot understand the foreign ownership decisions. I do not know how the Government has arrived at the foreign ownership processes. I do not know how the Government has arrived at the decision that there will be only four transponders opened up to pay television, with two later on. I do not understand how the Government has decided that it will keep the ABC out of the process. I do not understand how the Government has reached decisions on the type of advertising, with the limitation of 10 per cent on advertising. I do not know how the Government has limited the Australian content. I could not understand how the Government adopted the attitude it did to X- and R-rated classifications. The X has been wiped out and it looks as though the R rating will be wiped out with the Government's acceptance of the amendments proposed in the House tonight by the Opposition after the Senate proposed to take up our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the rationale for protecting commercial free to air from a fourth competitor until at least 1997, why should there not be a fourth competitor in free to air? What the Labor Party has failed to achieve is real competition. What it has done, by confining the competition to areas that it can control and regulate, is to force people to go to it cap in hand. Provided the Government sets the rules, the broad parameters in broadcasting in Australia, surely there is no logical reason to limit who may get at these resources. Provided one can limit how they are used, the standards that are to apply and the qualifications of the people, why should there not be open competition for all of what is a public utility, the use of the airwaves. How can the Government decide that three is better than two or that three is better than four? I cannot see why it has not attached a provision for a fourth competitor to these processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. What can be fitted in should be allowed and it should be open competition. The Government will never be able to sort it out any other way. The same provisions that apply here to licensing apply to the use of the spectrum. We have had a parliamentary committee examine the use of the spectrum, and the decision of that committee&mdash;comprising Labor, Liberal and Independent members&mdash;was that there must be greater commercialisation and that the only way in which competition can be effectively gained in the media is to have people bidding for the licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why existing radio operators should be protected from competition when there is no spectrum scarcity. Why cannot FM and AM be opened up somewhat more? I cannot understand why the trade-off for the ability to own two stations in a market and for monopoly operators to be granted supplementary licences would allow new players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the transponder decision&mdash;why four and one and one: why not three and three; why not two and two and two, or one and one and one until it got to six? The Government has not explained itself in this area. The only reason it is not capable of explanation is that there is an agenda laid out by the Prime Minister to suit the agenda of the Government, and that will suit the friends of the Government. I cannot understand why the logic of opening up pay television should not be such as to encourage those people who think that they can provide a service to do so. If they fail, they fail. But at least the quality of what they do will be tested by the Australian people and not by a government led by a man who plays favourites and mates rather than making logical decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the rationale for allowing commercial free to air television into pay television. It can happen, but why did the Government decide that? If it adopts our philosophy and says that everybody ought to have a go, that is fine; but it then says that there have to be limitations in some areas. Then it allows the commercial free to air into pay television as well. There is no logic in what it is doing. One either keeps people out or lets them in and has competition. One does not have the mixture that the Government has, which brings people to the Government to say, `What do you want, Government, so that we can comply?'. That is where the thing falls flat. In seeking to please the Government, people will show favouritism to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the rationale for special ownership limits on pay TV? As far as foreign ownership is concerned, why not allow 200 per cent foreign ownership? Why does the Government want to play around with this ownership process in the way that it does? Could it not be said that the free to air people have a vested interest? Foreign owners may have a vested interest. Why not let in at least one player who has some experience and can show how it can be done? What player will be interested with a 30 per cent interest? Given the relatively high ratings of local shows on free to air, is not the 10 per cent Australian content just a token gesture? I do not know. I cannot follow all of these decisions that the Government has made. They seem illogical. It has just plucked figures out of the air and come up with a formula that suited the factions, but it has not really arrived at a comprehensive approach to broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition has said is: why should you not open up the fourth channel? Why should you not open up the four transponders plus the two transponders to have six pay television opportunities? In all of this, why has there been a hidden agenda? Why, having got rid of Aussat, is the Government now protecting Telecom's investment in optic fibre? It seems like that to me because that decision is restricted to 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot follow what the Government has done. One can only be suspicious then of what the Government has done. Despite some good innovation, I am fearful of the rationale behind what is being done to broadcasting in Australia. My predictions are that we will have much the same as we have had in the past. We will be devoid of innovation and of real competition. We will have a half-baked everything. Instead of allowing challenges in to give those who are innovative, those who are imaginative, a chance at a new delivery process, the Government has confined it in every area. I am heartened that the Government has moved to a certain extent, I will admit, but I am disappointed that the Government has not chosen to be innovative the whole way. I would have thought that those people who call the shots in the Government could have forced things to a position where, not controlled by the Prime Minister, they could be innovative and meet the needs of the Australian people who are desperate for a change, for innovation and for new ideas in the Australian broadcasting system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says that we cannot answer them. Let us just go to some of the questions. I have only noted three; perhaps three will demonstrate my point. First of all, he is critical of the Government because we are proposing to increase network reach, the maximum reach of any particular owner or consortium on free to air television, from 60 per cent of the national viewing audience to 75 per cent. His first question was: why not 100 per cent? Why not go all the way?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the honourable member for Mitchell, the reason we are stuck at 60 per cent today is that his Party, and others in the Senate when we were in the old Parliament House, blocked our Government's attempts to raise that network reach to 75 per cent. So his Party, his vote, have kept it at 60 per cent for a long time. We are bumping it up to 75 per cent, a position we have advocated for almost five years now. The honourable member for Mitchell says that it really should be at 100 per cent, but time and time again in the past the Opposition has voted not for 100, not for 75, but for 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question he asked was: why is there not a fourth competitor on free to air television? Why is there not another free to air television channel in addition to the 7 network, the 9 network and the 10 network? I wonder what sort of television we would have in Australia on free to air if a fourth competitor were allowed to start up tomorrow. There would not be a sudden increase in the amount of advertising revenue which would be available to the television industry; we would have a massive increase in costs in the industry in providing the extra program material, the news programs and other things and we would threaten the entire commercial viability of the three existing commercial television channels. That is the reason we will not allow members of the Opposition, as much as they and their Party would like it, to start up a fourth network tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said that there should be more competition and more choice in the capital cities in the networks, yet it was his Party&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;and the National Party which tried to stop this Government, through aggregation, providing people in rural and regional Australia with a choice of three channels. He is busy arguing that the people on the North Shore should get a fourth network, commercial television signal, when his Party did everything it could to stop people in rural and regional Australia getting more than one commercial signal. So the honourable member seems to have a different point of view today than he had a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question the honourable member for Mitchell asked was: why should there not be 100 per cent foreign ownership? We do not know whether he was talking about free to air television or pay television. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I for one would find it abhorrent to have a foreign company, or a group of foreigners from Japan, the United States, Britain or elsewhere, owning an Australian television station&mdash;free to air or pay TV. This Government has imposed very strict limits on foreign investment in television. We have said that no one individual can own more than 15 per cent of free to air television, and no free to air television consortium can have more than 20 per cent in total foreign investment. We have said that the limit for pay television should be 20 per cent for individuals and 35 per cent overall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is saying that it would have no problem if a foreign company or foreign individuals owned 100 per cent of pay television. That is something which I, as a member of the Australian Labor Party, would oppose completely. Why are we worried about that? I am sure the many people in the gallery tonight would be concerned if they became aware that NBC, CBS or ABC&mdash;one of those networks in the United States&mdash;owned one of the television channels in Australia. They would simply dump their programs on Australian television. There is a fair amount of criticism of the quality of American programs which are currently broadcast on Australian television. If we think that we are seeing the best of American television today, imagine if we had ABC or NBC broadcasting, 24 hours a day, the same junk programs that are broadcast on American networks. That is what we would end up with if the honourable member for Mitchell and others had their way. Those are my answers to the three questions put by the honourable member for Mitchell. I hope that helps explain the reasons why this House has taken very strong positions on each of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the contribution made by my friend the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the shadow Minister for communications. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) conceded, he has played a very constructive role in seeking to ensure that this Bill maps out future directions for Australia's broadcasting system. I strongly disagree with the model which the shadow Cabinet has put forward for pay television in Australia. Members of the shadow Cabinet have said that they do not want a system such as the one proposed by the Government. That system was to have one consortium with transponders one to four, with certain conditions on who could bid for channels one to four, and then, to promote competition in pay television, to allow other bidders to come forward for transponders five and six. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's view is that it is important that we create a new player in the media by prohibiting any of the existing television networks, any of the existing telephone companies and any of the existing major players in newspapers being involved in that consortium which will bid for the first four transponders. That will mean that we will have a new major force in Australia's media. That is something which will promote diversity in our media. It is something which I thought both sides of this House would support. Instead of that proposal&mdash;we do not have a sensible package from the Opposition, one that groups together the first consortium in having four channels: one for news, one for movies, one for entertainment and one for sport&mdash;the Opposition puts forward a proposal where there are five separate companies owning five separate transponders, with the ABC out on a limb having the sixth. All of us should realise that that is simply unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely members of the Opposition know what happened in Canada when it went down a similar route. When Canada introduced pay television it established four different companies, four different competitors, and three of those went broke within 18 months. How can a country with the population of Australia support five pay television consortiums operating on a commercial basis, plus the ABC? That is just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members think that Australians will consider paying $400 for their satellite dish and their decoder, and then pay $10 a week&mdash;not to one company to get four channels, which I have already explained, under the Government system&mdash;to five different companies so that they can get their five different movie channels? It is a joke. It is a proposal that will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition goes further than that and says that it is very important that we allow the ABC to be involved. The only way that can happen is to give the ABC its own transponder. We have seen a bit of support for this in some places. I have great reservations about a proposal which mandates the ABC the right to one of the six transponders. I will explain why. First of all, I think it would give a windfall profit to the companies that have already negotiated agreements with the ABC. A few weeks ago the ABC had a launch in the Parliament House theatrette for the Galaxy consortium, which will involve the ABC and a number of silent partners, a number of companies whose identity none of us know. If the Opposition gets its way and the ABC is guaranteed a transponder, then those silent partners, those companies whose identity we do not know, will make massive windfall profits because of that decision, that policy, of the Opposition. I would have grave reservations as to whether, in communications policy terms, it would be proper to grant this to these companies whose identity we do not know, which have negotiated these deals with the ABC. I think that proposal is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition might say, `We are giving the ABC its own transponder so it does not have to do deals with anyone. We want the ABC to run this sixth transponder channel on its own like it runs ABC radio and ABC television'. The problem with that is that the ABC has promised&mdash;crossed its heart and hoped to die&mdash;that none of the money it currently gets for free to air television and free radio will be diverted to pay television, so the quality of existing ABC programming will not suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition has its way, the ABC will have to run the sixth transponder channel on its own. Where will the money come from if there are no silent partners to get windfall profits as part of that sixth transponder channel? One could be permitted to ask: if the Opposition thinks that because pay TV has developed, the ABC must be given the sixth transponder, why are video stores and bookshops different? Why does the Opposition not say that every sixth bookshop in Australia has to be an ABC bookshop? Why does the Opposition not say that every sixth video store has to be flogging ABC videos? The whole concept is crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people in my Party were pushing a proposal that we should mandate the involvement in pay television of not only the ABC but also commercial television. I always oppose that proposal because it would be unfair to require the other people seeking to be involved in pay television to give a certain percentage to the ABC or Channel 9 or Channel 7 or Channel 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package that this Government has brought forward provides for a new player in pay television. It provides for a system that is economical and will be commercially viable because a new player will have those first four transponder channels. At the same time, it promotes competition by allowing other players to come in on the fifth and sixth transponders, and it allows the provision of other technologies to provide pay television to Australians if they wish to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some discussion in this House today about the Opposition's real agenda on this matter. The Opposition has made it clear that it will slash ABC funding by 10 per cent, which is $50m. It will say to the ABC, `Despite the fact that we are massively cutting back your funding, you have to keep all your existing programs on television and all your existing programs on radio. On top of that, we are going to give you a pay television service'. It is very clear that the ABC cannot meet all those new responsibilities. It cannot start providing that new programming for pay television if the Opposition will not give it any extra funding. Not only is the Opposition saying, `We won't give you any extra funding for your special ABC pay television service'; it is actually cutting back funding to the ABC by $50m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said at Question Time today, this is all about the Opposition wanting to push ABC television from the free to air system onto pay television. The majority of Australians depend on ABC television as an independent, non-political broadcaster&mdash;that is, an independent broadcaster which does not take partisan positions&mdash;with an independent board, yet the Opposition is seeking to have it pushed onto pay television. That will mean that ordinary Australians will have to spend $500 plus $10 a week to get the ABC signal. I would have thought that everyone on this side of the House would totally oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, on the other hand, has made it clear that it will be providing $12 1/2m to allow the ABC to be part of a consortium to bid for the fifth or sixth transponder. In addition, we have amended the ABC Act so that there are no legal doubts about whether the ABC can be involved in pay television. The ABC retains the right to be a program supplier to the consortium which might win the bid for transponders Nos 1 to 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very clear that the Opposition has many difficulties with its proposals. The Opposition has claimed that five different companies, which are not allowed to make arrangements with each other, can compete for pay television. It is not economically viable. Canada, which has a much bigger population than we do, had a system with only four competitors and three of the four went broke in the first 18 months. The core of the Government's proposal is to generate a new player in Australia's media by allowing one company to bid for the first four transponders. That will promote greater diversity in Australia's media and will be very important for the promotion of wider diversity of opinion in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have suggested that because the Government will allow newspaper companies and the existing television players to bid for transponders Nos 5 and 6, transponders Nos 1 to 4 are now not viable. Some Opposition members are now saying that no-one will bid for transponders Nos 1 to 4 because Nos 5 and 6 are now open to new competition. Opposition members and others who have put forward this thesis have swallowed the line of vested interests who very clearly have announced that they will be part of the consortiums which will be bidding for transponders Nos 1 to 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those vested interests will argue that they should be looked after and protected. They will say that they need a period of exclusivity so that they have no competition in pay television for two years or three years or seven years. They will argue for as long as they can get, because it will protect their investment in transponders Nos 1 to 4. If I were rich enough to be an investor in transponders Nos 1 to 4, I would also argue that I should be protected and looked after, and that Kerry Packer and Channel 7 and Channel 10 and everyone else should be prevented from starting up for seven years, after I have started reaping profits on my investment. But we have to ask whether that is in the interests of Australians. We have to ask whether that is the competitive model that we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the compressed digital video technology is introduced in a few years time, the consortium that wins the bid for transponders Nos 1 to 4 will have not four channels but 16 or 24 or perhaps even 40. When we remember that, it becomes very clear that while any investment in transponders Nos 1 to 4 will be costly initially, it is a licence to print money in the long term. Anyone who suggests or argues that no-one will bid for transponders Nos 1 to 4 will be proved completely wrong when those bids are revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a comment on the Opposition's concerns about the provision of R-rated videos on pay television. The Government has made it clear that there will be no X-rated material on pay television. X-rated is out. The next classification under X-rated is R-rated. The Government has said that we want the technology to be sophisticated enough for parents to be able to program into the pay TV decoder whether or not they want their family to have access to R-rated videos that might come through the pay television system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If parents let their children watch television unsupervised, they can encode into their video machine that they do not want their machine to show R-rated movies. That way, any children or young adults in that household&mdash;or the adults, for that matter&mdash;will not have access to the R-rated movies. We think that provides a technological solution to the legitimate concern that many parents might have about the provision of R-rated movies in their home. I think that provides an option which should be explored. I understand there is some suggestion that the Australian Broadcasting  Authority  will  investigate whether this will provide adequate protection and whether there is community concern about this issue. I think we will be able to come up with a proposal that makes sense for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition alternative is for five separate companies, each with a transponder, plus the ABC. That proposal is not commercially viable and will simply result in five companies going bankrupt and Australians not getting access to pay television. We are 10 years behind the times on this technology. We are not going to force Australians to take the technology. I imagine that 90 per cent of Australians will not use the technology in the first decade or so, but those Australians who wish to pay the money for a decoder and a dish and for their weekly movies should have the right to choose. In the end, that is what competition is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 to express some concerns about the way the debate has evolved and, of course, is still evolving here tonight. My concerns relate to regional and rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House is long overdue. This Bill is the first major attempt to rewrite the broadcasting legislation in 50 years. However, it does not go far enough, and I will be expressing my concerns in this debate. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) say that all Australians have access to free to air services. I will present figures here tonight which will certainly prove that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced on 3 June that one initial satellite pay TV operator will have the right to operate a four-transponder satellite pay TV service. A further two satellite pay TV operators would each be licensed to operate a single transponder satellite pay TV service one year later. The telecommunications carriers and large newspaper groups would be excluded from the four-transponder service. Free to air television equity would also be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's announcement made no provision to ensure that pay television is accessible to regional and rural communities. Pay television is to be transmitted via Optus Communication's Aussat series B satellite and, of course, there are no restrictions on other technologies which would bring pay television to Australia. But as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia is a very large land mass and the most obvious and economical way for it to reach all Australians in the first instance is via satellite. Of course, as satellites improve, technology improves, and so too will the way television is brought to people via satellite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the Prime Minister was to use the high performance beam from the series B satellite of Optus, which would access between 90 and 94 per cent of Australian households. That is reasonable access. But under the Prime Minister's plan up to 10 per cent of Australian households, including those situated in Darwin, Hobart and regions further than 200 kilometres inland, would be unable to access pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the high performance map we see that the high performance beam is shaped a little like a banana. I think it covers access to the banana republic. It certainly covers Melbourne&mdash;the disaster area&mdash;Sydney and Canberra. There is a little circle over Perth. If we look at the rest of the landmass of Australia under the high performance beam, we find that large areas of Australia, including major population centres, will not have access to pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) all purport from the Government side of the House to represent the rural sector. If we look at their chances of getting pay television from the high performance beam, we find that a person who lives close enough to the coast might have to get up to a five-metre dish to receive it. We all know that is impractical, and it will be too costly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am stunned that the honourable members for Kennedy and Leichhardt are not in here tonight addressing the issue. Their silence on this issue has been deafening. I have in fact been endeavouring to bring to the attention of people in the Northern Territory what is happening on this issue. I have had calls from as far away as Broome in Western Australia asking me what is going to happen. When the Prime Minister originally made the announcement that pay television would be coming to Australia, I think all Australians had the idea that they were going to have access to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Prime Minister's statement, he made a commitment to investigate ways of improving and expanding the free to air services in regional and remote areas, where early access to pay TV, as we know, will be difficult. I am very pleased to see that in the other chamber last night the Government accepted an amendment by the coalition, a very important amendment which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. Clause 93, page 39, add at the end the following subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(6) Notwithstanding subsection (1), services under the initial satellite licence may use satellite capacity other than the 4 transponders referred to in that subsection for the purpose of ensuring that as much of Australia as possible is covered.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's requirement that the transponders provided on the satellite be utilised in such a way as to ensure that as much of Australia as possible is covered was agreed to by the Government and is a response to the legitimate concern that many Australians in regional and remote locations may not be able to receive pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that many people in regional and rural Australia have access to only one free to air service, and that is the ABC. Most people in urban Australia take it for granted that they will have five free to air services. It is taken for granted that urban Australia has access to five channels&mdash;three commercial networks, the SBS and the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took out some figures for the electorate of Maranoa, which does not fall under the high performance beam footprint. The people of Maranoa are already paying for their commercial television. It is not a condition of the licence for the commercial TV operator to provide its television services to communities of fewer than one thousand people. I intend to seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>a table showing the costs associated with bringing commercial television via satellite to the electorate of Maranoa. It shows that it costs local authorities in the electorate of Maranoa $406,000 to install equipment to put in commercial channel access to their residents. They have annual costs of $49,000. That is hardly a free to air service. I am sure the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) would agree. That is not a free to air service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Government is yet to respond to a proposal developed by Optus Communications which ensures that all regional communities have access to pay television and an improved free to air service. Optus proposes to utilise four regional spot beams on the new series B satellite which currently deliver remote area services. If we look at the proposal of Optus and at the coverage of the spot performance beam footprint, we find that nearly all of Australia will get a pay television service, and improve its free to air services if the Government acts on Optus's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about Optus's proposal is the fact that it has the potential to save governments money. To bring commercial satellite television to regional and rural Australia today, both State and Federal governments have to subsidise it. By taking up the Optus proposal for pay television, we can utilise the transponders much more efficiently and effectively. It means that the transponder that is now bringing the supposedly free to air service to regional and remote Australia will have its cost lowered because, through the introduction of digital compression, we will be able to get more channels on the existing transponder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of bringing the free to air service and pay television service on that one transponder is lowered, which means that governments, both State and Federal, have the potential to save up to $15m if the Government accepts the Optus proposal. I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) is thinking in terms of section 7 of the Optus strategy for pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to have this section incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but I believe that it is one of the strategies the Government has failed to address fully. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary takes on board my comments on that issue because it is extremely important. Not only do we bring pay television and more commercial free to air services to all Australia; we lower the cost for State and Federal governments&mdash;and $15m in this day and age is not a small amount. We would also be lowering the cost to those local authorities which already have to provide a commercial television service to communities of less than a thousand people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the digital compression technology it is anticipated that the four regional spot-beams that have the capacity to bring this pay television to all Australian households could provide eight digital video broadcast channels, ensuring that regional Australia has access to the ABC, SBS, one commercial channel and up to five pay TV channels. The important message in this whole debate is on access to pay television and more free to air services. Too often regional and rural Australia are forgotten in legislation by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the hour is late and we are waiting on reports from the Senate. In conclusion I say that my concerns are regional and rural Australia. I want to ensure that not just 90 per cent of the Australian population but all Australia has access to pay TV. Some of the figures that have been put forward in research on market penetration indicate that in regional and rural Australia there will be a much greater number of people wanting pay television than in urban Australia. The research shows that 40 to 50 per cent of the 700,000 regional and rural Australian households would take up pay television, whereas in urban Australia only 20 to 25 per cent would take up pay television. So there is potentially a much bigger share of the market out there just waiting, provided that access to pay TV is ensured for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this debate does conclude tonight. Of all people, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins from the Northern Territory, should ensure that regional and rural Australia are given due consideration so that they have access to pay television and improved free to air services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions   and Consequential Amendments) Bill. I note that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has spoken about the importance of access to people in rural and remote areas of Australia. This Government shares that concern. I point out to the honourable member for Maranoa that when the question of aggregation came before this Parliament, the Liberal-National Party Opposition opposed aggregation, which was the important extension of television services. If we take Canberra, for example, where there are now in effect three commercial television services available, there has been a significant improvement for people in this region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose electorate is involved in this issue, would know that his electors now have three services commercially, as well as the ABC. This means that people who were previously denied these services now get them under aggregation. The honourable member for Maranoa should know that the record of the Liberal and National parties is not good. They opposed aggregation. I point out that the extension of these services to many people in Australia has been the result of the policy of aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member is quite correct when he says that the ABC is very important for people in rural and remote areas of Australia. However, I think he should talk to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), because the effect of his policies will be to do away with the ABC. So there is a real problem there. I share the honourable member's view that when we get out beyond metropolitan Australia the ABC is a very important service to people. I am strongly of the view that the ABC needs to be adequately resourced. But if we look at the policies in the Fightback package, they certainly do not point to funding of the ABC but in the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition should look at those two things. Aggregation very effectively extended services to many people in Australia. We can see that in this region, even in the television we watch in Parliament House, where there are three commercial services, SBS and the ABC. When the honourable member asks the question about the extension of services in Australia, he should remember that the Opposition policy on the ABC is not encouraging. It is a very significant issue, and the honourable member should take the matter up. I would be on his side in saying to the Leader of the Opposition that he ought not to be winding back the ABC. It provides an essential service in providing information for rural people, particularly in the industries in rural Australia, through radio and television. So the honourable member will not have opposition from me on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the honourable member's figures on providing television for local councils in the electorate of Maranoa. He should advise his electors that when he puts on the 15 per cent GST it is going to be a sight more expensive than it is just as it stands. That needs to be factored in. When these things are added up, under the Opposition's policies the picture is not an attractive one for people in the honourable member's electorate. I say this with due consideration to the honourable member, but he needs to understand this. It is a constant dilemma for members of the National Party. They come here and they agree with policies in Canberra. When they get out to their electorates those policies are somewhat less attractive&mdash;policies such as winding back on the ABC and certainly putting 15 per cent on these costs in rural Australia. Those costs will increase by 15 per cent. It is a charge and any charge attracts the GST, and it is at 15 per cent. So we are looking at a very substantial amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We begin to understand that these issues are very important and very divisive within the Opposition, and they will continue to be. Every time the honourable member talks about this his electors understand. My colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) has worked hard on this legislation and has made very close representations to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), along with the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the Parliamentary Secretary, on this question of coverage for his electorate. This is not something those honourable members would want to say, but I will say it. They have made close representations and they have pushed the issue; but they will also be saying in rural and regional Australia that the 15 per cent GST will hurt the people, whether the honourable member is talking about the provision of broadcasting services or any other price that is at stake in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa will not take this kindly. The honourable member for Kennedy will be pointing this out to them; so will we. The Opposition has a tough agenda. I know the honourable member for Maranoa fancies himself for the hard road, and it is going to be a hard road. The honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for the Northern Territory will be out there and they will be putting this very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not just trivial issues; they are substantial issues. We have listened to the honourable member. It is a very important issue to consider. With due consideration, those opposite opposed aggregation. Those services are important to people. The Opposition policy is to wind down the ABC, yet the ABC is essential. When the 15 per cent is put on these broadcasting services, let alone everything else, they have a very interesting package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to some of the other issues. The honourable member for Maranoa raised some of these issues and I think we will find ourselves in agreement on some of them. A very important threshold question in relation to pay TV is that of sporting rights. I have raised this with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) because it is of enormous concern to people in Australia. Channel 9's current coverage of rugby league games is appalling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame, because it used to be well covered by Channel 10. Channel 9 has made rugby league coverage a second grade quality product, yet it can do better than that. It has wound down the coverage of rugby league, which really is a shame. It is a consequence of our not having mandated. We should make it a condition of the licence that a licence holder who acquires rights to a sporting contest and does not exercise those rights, should forfeit those rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this as an example. When Channel 9 had the rights to the cricket and the Wimbledon tennis&mdash;both from the UK&mdash;the ABC became the residual carrier of that test cricket. Bob Massie from Perth, for example, went over and covered for the ABC that second test in England. We as a community and as a parliament simply did not say that these rights must be exercised. I hope my comments are noted and taken to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise of acquired rights ought to be made a condition for licence. We are talking about people in Australia generally. If sporting rights are acquired and not exercised, they should be forfeited; it is as simple as that. Why should we allow a monopoly position to obtain, where it is possible for people simply to be denied their rights to the coverage of rugby league, Australian football, the Melbourne Cup, Wimbledon tennis, cricket and so on? We face that prospect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to pay TV, although the Minister has given me an assurance&mdash;and I accept that assurance because he is a good Minister&mdash;that this coverage will still be made available free to air, we will have to be very vigilant because, quite frankly, experience overseas says the opposite. What happens is that initially the stations are free to air, but then the big players move in and buy them up. Then people have to watch them whenever they say so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very clear issue. Despite the assurances we might be given now, we as a parliament and as a community must ensure that what happened overseas does not happen within Australia; that sporting rights are acquired and then the monopoly power that obtains acts against the public interest. We have already seen the beginning of that circumstance with Channel 9. Its coverage of rugby league is, to say the least, abysmal. We need to have a prospect of proper coverage of sporting activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as pay TV is concerned, it would be a sad day if sporting rights were acquired for pay TV and then taken off air, in effect. But this would be the prospect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of play has been made here about X-rated and R-rated programming.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order!  The honourable member for Stirling will resume his seat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Acting Deputy Speaker for his consideration because I was addressing my remarks to the Chair. One of my greatest concerns is that we do not allow violence the free rein that it currently has through the video stores, for example. It is instructive to go into a video store and look at the number of what I would call Rambo-type movies that are available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I share the Opposition's concern with respect to some of the coverage of matters that may be on pay TV, the issue of violence is something that we do have to address. It is important because I think violent productions are given far too much free rein both in videos and perhaps in pay TV. I do not condone violence and I do not regard its use&mdash;in the way, for example, that Sylvester Stallone made his rather unremarkable career&mdash;as suitable for an entertainment medium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to this question of public broadcasting. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who is at the table, and the staff to note that I have a very considerable concern so far as the allowance made in the Bill for advertisements on public broadcasting. We are talking about some four minutes per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very big concern for a radio station like 6NR in Perth, which provides very good sporting coverage as well as the BBC World Service. The requirement for taking the BBC World Service is that it must be uninterrupted; ads cannot be injected into it. Obviously, the BBC would object to that because the original is not provided with advertisements. In effect, we have five hours on 6NR at night when there are no advertisements. Then, when 6NR covers sporting events, which it does very well, it tries to give as much uninterrupted coverage as possible, so what we get is the bunching of advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think 6NR has a very real concern. Obviously, it is a public broadcaster and does not want to deluge the listeners with ads, but it wants to be able to work towards a situation of being able to average out its advertisements over the 24 hours, rather than have to fit them in within specific time brackets. I am sure that is a matter which can be resolved. I understand that the consultant recommended 8 minutes per hour as the figure to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not happen to be a very great supporter of advertisements in terms of their interruption to coverage of programs, but public broadcasting has a need for revenue. I ask that the point be noted. Perhaps it is something that could be addressed, because it is an issue with 6NR. It has also been raised with me in respect of the information radio for the print handicapped in Perth. That station also takes some BBC programs, which again cannot have advertisements inserted. That station is saying, `We are a public broadcaster. We are not a high profile advertisement station, but we would like to be able to work to an average in the 24 hours of advertisements rather than have prescribed the number for each hour'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure colleagues would understand, the BBC World Service on 6NR, which is very well listened to from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., is a program that is very popular, but the station cannot put advertisements into it because that is the requirement of the BBC. I think it would be a shame if 6NR lost that service. It would also be a shame if we mandated the advertisements in such a way that the station was prevented from providing its current coverage, both the BBC program and sport, for example. I raise that matter, because I am sure that it can be addressed. The public broadcasters asked me to draw that to the attention of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that concerns me is the question of coverage as far as television is concerned. I have spoken previously in this place on the lamentable program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS>, which was shown on Channel 10. That program is almost equalled by another lamentable program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances</EMPHASIS> on Channel 9. The only redeeming feature of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances </EMPHASIS>is that it is on at night, whereas <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS> was on prime TV&mdash;also <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances</EMPHASIS> is an Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Channel 9 says that it ought be able to defend itself for putting on the promotions of that program during children's viewing time, but I think that is unacceptable. As the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) would recognise, these programs are exploitative of women. I have a fundamental objection to that; I really do. I think that we ought to be able to expect a bit better. I am not saying that as a wowser; I am not. I just do not see great merit in them. I could certainly see no redeeming feature in the program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS> which, to put it bluntly, was just a commercial meat market for women and was shown on prime time and children's time television on Channel 10.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experiment with deregulation to allow advertisements to be run according to the whims of the commercial TV stations was a failure. Honourable members would probably have noticed, as I did although I do not watch commercial television a lot, that these stations deluge viewers with ads during a good film. As the movie draws towards its better parts, the number of advertisements increases. These stations have shown that they are quite incapable of managing themselves and, in fact, the move of the then ABT to deregulate was a failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Studs</EMPHASIS> made it to air is indicative that that sort of deregulation was a failure anyway.

Channel 10 really worries me; it has moved so much downmarket. I wonder what we will end up with?  I think it is called actuality television, which basically means that if they can get a real murder on television, it is good television.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A local issue that does concern me is the interruption to television coverage in the Scarborough area in my electorate where, due to building designs, we cannot now get proper television coverage. I believe the time has come when we ought to oppose the reissue of licences to commercial stations in Perth unless they are prepared to put in repeater and translator stations to enable those viewers who can no longer get a proper television picture to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will find it interesting that the Observation City building&mdash;the Bond monument to WA Inc.&mdash;has managed to destroy the television reception of many people in Scarborough. To many viewers it has been more than a toothache, it has been a headache. It is an issue that needs to be addressed in terms of the licence conditions for the stations. We ought to make it a condition of the licence that repeater and translator stations be put in so that viewers can get a proper television picture. At present they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on these couple of points. It is essential that the question of sporting rights be mandated as far as both pay TV and free to air television are concerned. I also believe that we ought to make it very clear to the holders of television licences that if they do not use those sporting rights they forfeit them. The other point I make is that I am concerned that Radio Australia must continue to provide the sporting coverage that it has in the past through 3LO and 2BL. It provides to many expatriate audiences very important sporting coverage, along with its news service, which sets standards in regions such as Indonesia, where people feel they can get honest and informative coverage of news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be supporting increased funding for Radio Australia to enable it to do a better job, to give better coverage with better transmitters. That is something that deserves high priority. If people happen to be out of Australia, Radio Australia is an essential communications medium. Wherever people go, they want to know the sporting results, and the only way to get them is through Radio Australia. The thing that disturbs me is that very often Radio Australia is reluctant to cover those programs. In fact, it can get them free from 3LO and 2BL, which provide the sporting services on Saturday and Sunday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Territories Law Reform Bill has caused those on this side of the House a great deal of concern, given the haste with which the Government wants to proceed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia first assumed responsibility for these islands in the 1950s. I think Australia purchased the islands from the Clunies Ross family in 1954. Since that time the law of the colony of Singapore, including laws from other sources such as imperial law, has been applied on both Cocos and Christmas Islands. It is a matter of considerable concern that only now, 40 years later, we are addressing these fundamental legal issues. Only now do we see fit to bring the Indian Ocean island Territories in line with Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 40 years, why is it that the Government is pushing through such vital constitutional legislation without adequate time for debate and consultation?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was originally introduced and guillotined in the Senate on 27 May. One hour was allocated for the debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the efforts of my colleague Senator Grant Tambling, the legislation was referred to a Senate committee for consideration. The Committee allocated half a day for this process. A total of 20 individuals and organisations made submissions to the Committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cocos and Christmas Islands are relatively small in both population and size. However, their strategic significance cannot be overlooked. They are, in effect, our aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean. Goodness me, we could do with a bit more effective surveillance in that part of the world. So these are strategically very important islands. The record of some boat people accessing Australia undetected is testimony to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities available on these islands would naturally be used by both the Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force in our regional defence planning. The Cocos Islands comprise 27 islands in total of which only two are populated. A total of 600 people live on Cocos Island.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the total population of the islands is very small, there exists a multitude of ethnic diversities. The majority ethnic groups on the islands are of Malay descent but are from different backgrounds. It is important to note that, while this Bill will essentially replace the Singapore based regime with a Western Australian based body of law, the regime will still be subject to modification by ordinance. Therefore, it is proposed that Western Australian law will be modified to suit the particular circumstances of the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 700 Western Australian Acts of parliament will be transferred in their administration to these islands as a result of this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my understanding of the amendment, the Government will be compelled to provide more detail regarding the application of Western Australian law on the Cocos and Christmas Islands. However, the amendment does not allow for the establishment of a consultative committee, a reflection of the Government's desire to push this Bill through as soon as possible in spite of broad community concern in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this legislation provides for the laws of Western Australia to apply to the Christmas and Cocos Islands, residents will have no representation in the Parliament of Western Australia. The islands form part of the Federal electorate of the Northern Territory. For voting purposes, residents can only have their say in the Federal arena. The Council on Cocos Islands and the Assembly on Christmas Island are not parliamentary bodies. They have no say in future law making. This poses a significant and fundamental constitutional dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point is that Western Australia has not yet agreed to any complementary legislation or entered into any service delivery arrangement or agreements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) was one of the most extraordinary contributions I have ever heard in this place by a gentleman who, I understand&mdash;I may be doing him a disservice&mdash;is the shadow Minister for Territories. The basic proposition he advanced was wrong. He expressed some sort of shock and outrage that the inhabitants of the Territories of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island were not able to vote in Western Australian State elections. If I were a shadow Minister with responsibility for Territories, my first port of call would be to visit the Australian Constitution to acquire some concept of a territory and the basic status of citizens of an Australian Territory in terms of their relationship to the Australian States. As a relatively competent shadow Minister, having done such a basic examination, I might have come to the conclusion that it was constitutionally impossible for residents of the Territories to vote in State elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have escaped the notice of the honourable member, but the ACT actually has a separate form of self-government. One of the fairly fundamental reasons for this is that residents of the ACT cannot actually vote in New South Wales; under the Constitution, they are not allowed to. That was the most obvious mistake in the contribution made by the honourable member, but the whole speech was in the same vein. It was quite an extraordinary contribution. The whole line of it was that there was some sort of conspiracy and that the Government was acting in bad faith in trying to pass this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Territories Law Reform Bill is replacing the most archaic set of laws for which Australia has responsibility. The legislation it is replacing is a great disgrace to Australia. The laws which currently operate in the Australian Territories on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island are essentially the laws that existed in Singapore in 1958. Even though there have been some amendments through ordinances and specific Acts of Parliament since that time, it is absolutely extraordinary that there should be some question thrown on the motives of the Government in trying to overturn that archaic system of law and replacing it with a modern up-to-date system of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the entire contribution of the honourable member for Maranoa, we heard no mention at all of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>. Again, I would have thought that the honourable member may have, somewhere in his research, come across this document. Maybe he has not seen it; I will send a copy around to his room. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member were familiar with the issues, maybe he would have canvassed, even in a minute way, the fact that this legislation stems completely from the recommendations that were made in the report of this Committee. As the honourable member for Maranoa would be aware, it was a bipartisan committee and had the very strong support of the Opposition members of that Committee. I would have thought that, in his contribution, the honourable member may have made mention of that. Obviously, he has not read the report, because he has no understanding of the issues raised in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard other outrageous assertions that the legislation was somehow being rushed along and secretly brought into this place. As the honourable member mentioned in his contribution, the whole process has seen an absolutely outrageous situation existing in terms of the state of the law in these Territories since the late 1950s. Of course, during that time, coalition governments were in office in this country; I submit that they paid next to no regard to the operation of these Territories. I also concede that the record of this Government has been by no means perfect in terms of dealing with the residents of those Territories. But we have seen since at least September 1988, when terms of reference  concerning the appropriate legal regimes to apply to these Territories were referred by the then Attorney-General to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a process which has finally led us to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member to say that there has been no consultation with or involvement of the local community is an absolute insult to those honourable members&mdash;including honourable members of his own political Party&mdash;who visited both of these Territories on two occasions. They engaged in extremely extensive consultations with the local residents and took public evidence in terms of the inquiry. I might add that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is now entering the chamber, took a great deal of detailed interest in the terms of that particular inquiry and the public evidence given on those islands. To say that there was no community input into the decisions that we are debating tonight is an absolutely outrageous and palpably wrong statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a process which started in September 1988. The Committee's report was tabled in Parliament in March 1991. During that same month, the memorandum of understanding concerning the Government and the population of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands was signed. That memorandum of understanding was signed only after a long process of consultation. Again, in his whole contribution, the honourable member did not even mention the fact that this particular outcome, in terms of reforming the legal regime of at least the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, was part of the memorandum of understanding signed between the Government and the Cocos community back in March 1991. It did not even rate a mention in his contribution. The honourable member said there had been no consultation in getting us to this point. That is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any doubt as to the need for this Bill and the need to reform the state of the law, I will bring to the attention of the House some of the evidence which the Committee heard about the state of the current law of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I think that would dispel any doubt. I draw the attention of the House to some of that evidence. For instance, here is some of the evidence of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the criminal law which applied on Christmas Island. I quote from the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite apart from the inappropriateness of some of the applied provisions of Singaporean criminal law, it is surely unacceptable that it is necessary to have to research a wide range of foreign statute and case law to establish the law applicable in an Australian Territory. Further, from a practical point of view, that foreign law is simply not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA>The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies, as quoted in the report, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The patchwork of laws pertaining . . . would seem to render the coherence and adequacy of those Territories legal regimes open to question.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the situation applying in the Territories, a resident of Christmas Island&mdash;a person who, according to the honourable member for Maranoa, was not spoken to because there had been no consultation with residents&mdash;commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time the laws and legislative structure operating on Christmas Island are totally inadequate to the needs of the population. Residents are not receiving equal benefits, rights or protection under the law to other citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. This has led to a generalised disillusionment with and distrust of the legal system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a substantial proportion of the population, the law of Christmas Island has long been regarded as a joke . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it should have been. We have a situation here where it was virtually impossible for a citizen of either Christmas Island or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to have any idea of what sort of law they were supposed to apply to themselves. To do that, they would have had to have gone through a process of discovering what Australian enactments had been specifically applied to the Territories; they would have to have known what the state of the law of Singapore was in 1958; they would have to have had some idea of what the received English law had been to the colony of Singapore prior to 1900; and they would have to have had some concept of what paramount law was. It was quite an extraordinary situation. Quite frankly, it is a disgrace to this Parliament that we let it exist for such a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing tonight is effectively replacing that archaic system of law with the law which currently applies in the State of Western Australia. Notwithstanding the comments of the shadow Minister, we did not pluck the law of Western Australia out of the air and say, `We're going to plant this on the Territories'. One of the processes which the Committee went through was to prepare an options paper which was circulated widely amongst the islands' residents, in which the options of maintaining the status quo, if you like, of the current legal regime, applying the law of Western Australia or applying the law of Northern Territory were offered to them. Overwhelmingly&mdash;I think almost without dissent&mdash;the view of the local communities, given in public evidence and in submissions to the inquiry, was that it was most appropriate that the law of Western Australia should apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is because the vast range of services provided to the islands are in fact sourced in Western Australia. Most of the goods which supply the islands come from Western Australia. To say that there were no services in place&mdash;which was another furphy that the shadow Minister came out with&mdash;I found quite breathtaking. The vast bulk of services which are enjoyed by island residents&mdash;such as education, health and what have you&mdash;are sourced from Western Australia under agreements between the Commonwealth and the State Government of Western Australia. I think the Federal Police still service the island, but the vast range of services come from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where the shadow Minister is getting this idea that there is nothing in place with regard to the provision of services. That is another thing about which he obviously has no idea. Someone has written the speech for him and he has got up in here and read it without having any idea about his subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is logical that the law of Western Australia should apply. Most of the Christmas Islanders and Cocos Islanders on mainland Australia live in Western Australia. There is a non-island community which is basically to be found in Western Australia. So it made good sense to the Committee and the local community to apply Western Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that every one of the laws of Western Australia and every one of that State Parliament's enactments are really applicable to the Territories. There certainly is a need for careful scrutiny of the laws that could apply. In the case of Christmas Island, I would certainly like to see a greater role for the local Assembly. It could play a consultative role in determining which Australian laws should apply and, as the Western Australian Parliament passes new laws, it could decide whether they are applicable to the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are circumstances where Western Australian laws could not be transferred easily&mdash;for instance, some of the health regulations with regard to the traditional means of cooking and some of the food establishments which the Committee had occasion to visit. It is very fine cuisine, but it is possibly not totally appropriate to apply the health standards of mainland Perth to these sorts of establishments. In circumstances like that there has to be a bit of commonsense and flexibility. But, on the whole, there is no question that it is appropriate that the laws of Western Australia should apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are a little different again from Christmas Island. The United Nations sponsored an act of self-determination in relation to the islands in 1984. There was a very clear vote&mdash;in fact, an overwhelming vote; it was over 90 per cent, from memory&mdash;from that local community to the effect that it wished to be incorporated into Australia. It was given the choice of independence, free association or integration into Australia and it voted overwhelmingly for the latter option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a good relationship between the Commonwealth and the Islanders. They are extremely proud people and they are very proud to be Australian. In fact, as a visitor to the island it struck me very strongly that this community, which lives much closer to Java and that part of Asia than it does to mainland Australia, is very fiercely Australian and very proud to be Australian. It was a matter of great pride that this community felt this way about Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have let these people down, at least inasmuch as we have allowed this archaic legal regime to continue. There is a strong community council on the Cocos Islands. The Committee met with the council, as well as individual residents of the islands. There are certainly unresolved issues in the way in which that community is operating. But I do not think we heard any real dissent at all in relation to the broad proposition that the current system of law was quite archaic and had to be repealed, and that the most appropriate alternative to the current system of law was the law of Western Australia, suitably modified to reflect local conditions. That was the Committee's principal recommendation in the legal regimes of the islands and that is what this Bill is giving effect to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take exception to another point which the shadow Minister raised in his contribution. He had a bit of a dig at the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). It seemed to me&mdash;and I think other members of the Committee will support this&mdash;that the local communities were more than happy with the efforts of the honourable member to make himself available to them. They are only very small communities in terms of an overall federal electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are like the very small country towns in my own electorate; one gets there as often as one can. But it is obviously a lot easier for me to drive for a few hours into the Brisbane Valley than it is for the honourable member for the Northern Territory to visit his constituents on Cocos and Christmas islands. But he certainly does service them and he makes their views very well known. I have heard him make speeches in this House about the interests of those constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do take exception to the remarks of the shadow Minister when he implied that the honourable member had not taken a great interest either in this legislation or the interests of those constituents. That is an unfair statement. The shadow Minister would not know one way or the other. He probably got that point from one of the senators from the Northern Territory and it is just a bit of politicking on his part. There is no truth in it whatsoever and that was made very clear to us when we visited the islands. All in all, this legislation is good legislation and it follows the recommendations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. </PARA>

The whole purpose of this sitting was to deal with legislation which we understood was to be amended, having been already introduced into this chamber. We were going to have special sittings. I have never heard of a greater affront to citizens of Australia and to residents of our Territories than this attempt to deal with what I regard as a very critical and important area at this hour of the night by interrupting debate on a major piece of legislation which was before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I realised we were dealing with this Bill only because I heard my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) speaking twice.

So I rang up to find out what the devil he was talking about. I found out we have been fiddling around with our program to deal with what I regard as a very critical and very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make the point that this Government is a disaster. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who chairs the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and had a great deal to do with this excellent report, for which I commend him, commented a moment ago about the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), whom I see entering the House. The honourable member for the Northern Territory knows that it is absolutely impossible for him to adequately represent the people of these two Territories. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Snowdon" NAMEID="IJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely impossible for him to represent them adequately. If he believes he is doing so it shows what a lousy job he is doing for the Northern Territory. The whole problem that my friend opposite has is that he fell foul of a system that was introduced by another one of his colleagues a few years ago suggesting that one vote, one value was a way by which a fair and equitable electoral system might be brought to Australia. I can tell him, as the honourable member for Maranoa explained a moment ago, that most of his constituents will be inadequately serviced by the piece of legislation on which debate in this House has been temporarily adjourned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the satellite cover, very few people in the Northern Territory will be within that made footprint. The point is that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has too many communities to cover and has no earthly chance of providing the sort of representation that he should. It is equally, if not more, impossible to provide the same service, or the service that each of us would like to be able to give all our constituents, when he has two Territories as remote as Cocos and Christmas Islands also to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put things into a bit of perspective. It is impossible for the honourable member to adequately represent those Territories, although I accept that it is far better for the people of the Territories to have a voice in the Parliament. To that extent, having the Northern Territory linked with those two Territories perhaps is the right way to go. Having had a lot of experience with another beautiful island called Lord Howe Island, which was represented for years through the member for Sydney&mdash;that was where the old flying boat used to originate&mdash;I know how inadequate that representation was. The honourable member for the Northern Territory seemed to take my remarks as a personal affront, but I am just telling him that it is physically impossible to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned, as I think every member of this place should be, that all of our constituents should have the same access to us as members as do the constituents of the smallest electorate in Australia. We have to be available when something goes wrong; we have to be able to represent those people in regard to a whole range of policy, bureaucratic issues and interests which, frankly, are becoming more complex and more significant as time passes. It is for that reason that I seriously question whether the honourable member for the Northern Territory is the most suitable representative. However, having canvassed the matter, I am equally not certain that it would be any better to have those Territories represented by a member for one of the Perth seats or any other in Australia. At one stage it was suggested that one of the ACT members represent one of these Territories, which would be even worse. So, having said that it is difficult, I think it would be even more so under almost any other arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One alternative that I thought of, although I do not think it would work because there are too few people in the Territories, is that we could have one member representing all of Australia's Territories. There might well be some equity in that. Our report deals not just with Cocos and Christmas Islands but also with significant questions relating to Norfolk Island, to which I have been, which is entirely different in its geography, its location, its history and its prejudices from Cocos and Christmas Islands. However, perhaps that is an alternative. There is a problem, and it is not something I suggest should be changed at this moment, although I think the representational factor is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of specifically adopting Western Australian law, however, as the honourable member for Fisher, who preceded me, identified, there is no doubt that that does make sense. It is the simplest and easiest way by which there can be some updating of laws which are so out of date that it is quite impossible to consider how anybody could possibly maintain them any longer. My trouble is not that; it is just that the Government treats the whole proposal of the Committee and this legislation with such disdain that it seeks to force it through the House at nearly midnight on a night when we were meeting for other purposes altogether. The whole process of legislative consideration by exhaustion leaves an enormous amount to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the detail of this legislation, there is little doubt that the application of Western Australian laws makes sense. As the honourable member for Fisher said, it was decided in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun,</EMPHASIS> having examined the alternatives, that that was by far the most appropriate course. Indeed, it is of interest that, for example, there are more residents of Cocos Island now resident in Western Australia than there are on Cocos Island. There is an incredible situation which creates some problems in terms of residential development and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say yes to the appropriateness of Western Australian laws. I am a little concerned, however, about the extent to which the local communities will have a say in the ordinances and in the transitional provisions. I note the way they have been provided in the Act. There is a problem in trying to maintain the currency of these ordinances, and I hope that the local communities will be given a voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An idea I have had for all these Territories, which I put to the Government, is that each one of them needs to be given status as a local government authority. I know that there are problems in ascertaining just how best to provide a local voice. As far as I am concerned, no matter where Australians live&mdash;and I classify all those who are residents in an Australian territory, although the Norfolk Islanders like to think of themselves as being Pitcairners or Norfolk Islanders rather than Australians&mdash;they are all classified as Australians. I think they should all have a democratic voice. I know that there is a sort of local government, and that there is a different form on Christmas from Cocos, as there is from Norfolk. Norfolk seems to have the most developed Legislative Assembly. But I am concerned that an identity should be established to enable the local body to take full responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding will be difficult. One of our problems as a Federal government is whether, if we give the responsibility to a local government body on Christmas Island or Cocos Island, that body will be responsible under the local government laws of Western Australia. Essentially the Minister for Territories in the past has exercised that overall supervision that is given to the local government Minister under ordinary ordinances. As far as I can see&mdash;and I have not looked at this legislation in the detail in which I might have because of the timing and the nature of its introduction&mdash;we have to be very careful how we ensure that those local communities have a voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look, for example, at Cocos Island. There are major Commonwealth interests remaining on that island. We now have defence facilities there. There is a major airport. On a defence basis I think we have a charge which at the moment is being totally and inadequately met by the Australian Defence Force, and one of my concerns is about maintaining our defence capability on the island. Setting that aside, when one looks at the Australian interests on the island as distinct from local interests, on West Island we have reason to make sure that the Commonwealth still has a significant say. But on Home Island and on the other islands I think it would be far more appropriate if jurisdiction were exercised locally. There is reference in the Committee report to a body that we met which has some authority, but the Cocos Malay community I think felt that most of the powers there seem to be exercised more through the cooperative. So we have this conflict between how to run the businesses of the island and how to run the administration of the island. I am not too sure whether that has been adequately covered under the legislation as it is here now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am suggesting that for both Cocos and Christmas Islands we have to look at providing more of a local government type authority and giving them full responsibility in that way. Had we done so, I think the situation might have been better than it is with the bodies that are there at the moment. Turning to funding for the future, rate incomes will be inadequate, so a way must be found to fund them. I think the only way to fund Christmas or Cocos Islands is that which is now envisaged. On Cocos Island, the cooperative will not be able to maintain its revenues once it starts introducing equal pay. The pay regime for people on the island is a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the pay regime, we also have to look at the employment problem. If we increase equal pay opportunities in Cocos, a lot of people will be unemployed. Then there are the problems, to which our report has given some attention, of those who are working for the Commonwealth and who, apparently because of the system, do not personally receive full pay. It goes to the cooperative and the workers draw a somewhat lesser level of pay on a distribution basis. Much of it goes back to those totally inadequate salary conditions that used to apply for Aboriginal people. We have to work out how that will be dealt with. As with the question of local government, I do not know that salaries, equity conditions, wages applicable and economic development are adequately addressed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Christmas Island community is different. I cannot say that I am really excited about pinning our hopes for economic viability on a casino. I am not morally opposed to casinos, but I do not find it particularly satisfactory to have so much Commonwealth money going into creating the environment for the casino because the mine has failed. I think tourism has to be addressed. I think we could have done many other things to address the advantages of the island in a tourist sense other than casting our lot with the casino. I have not been there since the Committee visited and I would be curious to know what is happening to that casino. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the economic survival of the communities of Cocos and Christmas Islands and the Malay Cocos community is an issue which we cannot pass on to Western Australia. There certainly will be a need for Commonwealth involvement. It is not just a matter of paying off the debt and passing over responsibility. While the adoption of the law is right, I think we have to be extremely careful in the way in which the ordinances are varied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding Norfolk Island, I noticed in the Minister's second reading speech that there is to be further legislation with respect to representation before the optional enrolment for the purpose of representation in the Federal Parliament. This has been a very difficult issue for the people of Norfolk, who I think are totally misunderstanding the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report. We are not saying to them, `You have to be Australians'. We are saying, `The Australian Government exercises significant authority over your well-being and we believe it appropriate that you should have a voice here to ensure that there is some way by which you might be able to ensure that your interests are protected'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a different system of enrolment for Norfolk Island which might be an advantage to the people of Christmas and Cocos as well. Having addressed very briefly the question of Norfolk Island being linked with the Northern Territory, I am not certain that we should not adopt the same procedures that, for example, we allow in the Australian Defence Force. A person who is enlisted in a community is able to preserve his or her identity with that community while he or she is in the services. I think that sort of system might be appropriate in Norfolk, Cocos and Christmas islands, but we need to wait for that legislation before we can be certain about what the Government intends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust the views of the people of the Norfolk Island community will be accommodated to the maximum. They feel very strongly on the issue. While I understand the significance for them of the agreement that was entered into between Queen Victoria and their forebears, I think modern reality would suggest that there needs to be some progress in, for example, as I have suggested, local government. I think they need to understand that there are some areas in which they benefit enormously from the Australian connection. I know they have accepted it in such areas as foreign affairs and defence. However, they question the degree to which, for example, civil aviation benefits them. At times, when I see some of the things the CAA does, I doubt whether it benefits anybody, but that is another question. There is a real problem in trying to meet the aspirations of the people on Norfolk Island. I will be interested to see that legislation when it is introduced. I trust that the views of the people on Norfolk Island can be accommodated to the maximum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that has not been addressed concerning Norfolk Island, which I mentioned when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report was tabled in the House&mdash;and I hope it will be considered when the next legislation comes in&mdash;is what I believe is an anomaly, in that some of those who are now members of the Norfolk Island Assembly are also its employees. I found it to be quite an extraordinary position that people were in a position of conflict in their respective roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that an employee should not be a candidate for election, but I do not believe it is appropriate that a person who is elected and is an office bearer should continue to be an employee. I think that puts the other office bearers of the Assembly and the administration in a totally hopeless position. I think that matter needs to be identified and prevented in the future. There might need to be some consideration of the pay and allowances of members of the Assembly, which is a part time obligation. I would prefer that there be a bar on what I see as the two offices of profit under the Crown in a situation in which I believe it would be almost impossible to reconcile conflicting interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me pleasure to rise in this debate on the Territories Law Reform Bill, although it did not give me a great deal of pleasure to listen to a couple of the contributions, particularly one from the Opposition. Unfortunately the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has left the chamber, and I will come to his contribution in a moment. But I want to make some comments about the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). He presented a case, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), which demonstrated a complete lack of knowledge, understanding or awareness of the issues involved in relation to this legislation. Not only that, but I think he insulted this House in a number of ways in the way in which he addressed the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should have been aware, as the honourable member for Fisher pointed out, of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>. He appeared not to be. He should have been aware of the extensive consultations and at least apprised himself&mdash;although it might be difficult for him to do so&mdash;of the history of the two island communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in the course of his contribution he made assertions about the Government taking 40 years. One would make two observations about that. Firstly, of course, we have not had control of either of those two island territories for 40 years. The other observation one would make is that for the best part of the period between 1955 and now the Opposition was in power. I suggest to the honourable member for Maranoa that he might have asked previous Ministers for territories in the Opposition&mdash;perhaps he should have even consulted the right honourable member for New England&mdash;why there was no move during the time that the Opposition parties were in government to address the abysmal living conditions of people either on Christmas Island or later the Cocos Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go particularly to the issue of Christmas Island. I guess the honourable member for Maranoa was mirroring the views of some other people around this place, particularly that person who masquerades as a representative of the people of Christmas and Cocos Islands in the Senate, the shadow Minister, Senator Tambling, who, under any definition, is a germ. I do not resile from that statement because I think it is an accurate depiction of the way in which the man operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that he would have some knowledge of these issues and would have imparted to the Opposition at least a bit of intelligence about them. One would think he would have informed the honourable member for Maranoa about the way in which the people on Christmas Island in this instance, and indeed the people on the Cocos Islands, were in their own separate domains almost enslaved by colonising powers, albeit in the one instance by an individual family, and in the other by a company. If it had not been for the wit and wisdom of this Government and its Ministers, including the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who was a Minister for Territories under this Government, these changes&mdash;which have been brought about to give people in those Territories an adequate and acceptable standard of living, to give them the same sort of status as people on mainland Australia&mdash;would not have been made and those people would still be living in the enslaved state in which no doubt some members of the Opposition would like them to have remained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Maranoa did not apprise himself of that history. Instead he had the gall to come in here and, like a kindergarten teacher, read a story&mdash;a story written by someone else, a story which bore no relation to the truth, a story which was novel, if not indeed misleading, in its interpretation of history. One would have to say that when the people of the Christmas and Cocos Islands read his contribution to this debate&mdash;there is no doubt they will&mdash;they will ask the very same questions. They will ask the questions that the honourable member for Fisher put to the honourable member after his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It galled me somewhat, as the member for the Northern Territory in whose electorate these two island communities are situated, to have to sit in this House and listen to the bunkum that came out of the mouth of the Opposition spokesperson. It is repetitious, as I have said earlier, of the sort of tripe that continually dribbles out of the jowls of Senator Tambling from the Northern Territory. It is no tribute to him or his Party. I will speak more of that person shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate on a number of the issues. Before I do, I pick up on one point about the right honourable member for New England. I regard the right honourable member as a generally nice person. He is a bit of an old stager, as he demonstrated this evening, but has the capacity to understand many of the detailed issues. Quite differently from the honourable member for Maranoa, he exhibited at least some knowledge because he had in fact been a member of the Committee which brought down this report. He spoke with some insight and indeed, I thought, some feeling about the people of the Christmas and Cocos Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said&mdash;and I have to pick him up on it; I am sure he will not mind&mdash;that he found it rather difficult to understand how I could possibly represent the interests of those island communities well. I have to tell him that if one lives in a rural remote area the size of the Northern Territory, or one lives in, say, the community of Kalgoorlie&mdash;and I remind honourable members that the area of the seat of the Northern Territory is about 1.4 million square kilometres&mdash;it is not unusual to make the effort to visit rural and remote communities. In fact, it is the modus operandi of a local member such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) or me. So I do not find it difficult at all to service the needs of the people on the Christmas and Cocos Islands. I think they would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would say to the right honourable member for New England, as the honourable member for Fisher said, that they believe that I look after their interests, or at least attempt to look after their interests, adequately. I am available, I do visit regularly, and I do take the trouble and time to discuss with them their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure my friends sitting in the advisers boxes here this evening from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories would attest, we have crossed swords more than once since I have been in the position of representing the interests of the islands in this House. I do not apologise for crossing swords with them. When there has been any conflict or difference it has by and large been constructive in the way in which it has been dealt with and the outcomes that have arisen from it. Those outcomes, more often than not&mdash;and I would say on almost every occasion&mdash;have been of substantial benefit to the communities on the Christmas and Cocos Islands. That has been largely due to the effort, the integrity and the ability of those people on the Cocos and Christmas Islands to articulate their desires. In the time that I have been in this position they have made it very clear to their local member what their requirements are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into this job and was first lumbered with the proposition that we were essentially going to close down Christmas Island, I met with members of the Union of Christmas Island Workers under their then General Secretary, Gordon Bennett, in a Homeswest motel in Perth. I think it was in about September 1987, just after the Government had announced its decision to close the mine. You, honourable member for Maranoa, would not know about the mine; you have never been there, you dill. </PARA>

He would not know. Yet he had the gall to come in here and read that drivel earlier this evening. He would not know about the consultative processes that have taken place. He would not know about the debates that have taken place between this Government and members of the island communities about their future. He would not have a clue.

This is another part of the process, another part of the stage of securing for them a future, control over their own lives and an ability to be able to influence government. They do that quite successfully through very articulate spokespersons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the Union of Christmas Island Workers, but it is not alone. The affairs of the island have been very well administered by the various administrators and staff on the island. I would have to say that I have not agreed with them all the time; I have had my blues with them. But I have never claimed&mdash;nor would I claim&mdash;that those people who have been administrators on the island on behalf of this country have not done their best and have not done what this and previous governments have asked them to do. The staff of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories have absolutely carried out what the Government has required of them. I have not always agreed with the decisions, as I have told the Ministers. We have found compromise and change and developed things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in the community who have made the effort and made a strong contribution to the development of their communities need to be recognised by this Parliament: people on the Cocos Islands such as Haji Wahin Bin Bynie, Cree Bin Haig, Parson Bin Yapat and Rabihu; people on Christmas Island, such as the present Administrator Michael Grimes; and Peter Gifford, the previous Administrator, and those before him. There is also the current Administrator on Cocos Islands, Barry Cunningham, who is a good friend of this Parliament. They have all made a strong contribution, as have individual members of the Christmas Island community. The Assembly has been reconstituted as a result of the efforts of members of the island community, because of their desire to have a voice in the way in which they are administered. The current Assembly under Peter Goh has been very important in persuading this Government that some changes needed to be made in the way in which we deal with the Islanders.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things that have to be put straight about the Territories Law Reform Bill. Firstly, if it was 3 a.m. and we had five minutes to get this legislation through, this House ought to get it through, because the two Territories involved have been under Australian authority for over 10 years&mdash;not 40 years&mdash;labouring under laws which judges have said from the bench in capital trials are impossible to administer and impossible to be fair with. One has to go to the archives to find copies. They are, as stated, the laws of Singapore as they were, unamended, in 1958. They are quite irrelevant to any period in the last 20 years. They relate to a period before Singapore itself developed its own body of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first occasion that I went to Christmas Island as Minister in 1985&mdash;only a year after we took control of the area&mdash;the local council specifically asked that proper laws be brought in for Christmas Island. Unfortunately, because there was always something more urgent in the drafting processes, those laws did not arrive while I was Minister. I regret that because they were urgently needed, particularly on Christmas Island, where there was at least one murder trial and a number of trials relating to drugs which were conducted in circumstances totally unacceptable to any form or any perspective of Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to get some of the facts correct about Australia's role in these two islands. In respect of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Australia acquired the islands by purchase in 1978, not 1954. The Minister who was responsible for the negotiations was, in fact, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who certainly was not in the Parliament in 1954. The islands were established with the home island under the control of the Cocos Malay population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cocos Council was established and is a local government body administering those areas other than the areas which Clunies-Ross, as part of the agreement, reserved to himself; that is, five hectares where the Clunies-Ross homestead is situated. That was in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, the people of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, under the auspices of the United Nations, undertook an act of self-determination. The leaders of the community went to the United Nations, which was quite a feat, and addressed the decolonisation committee. The islands voted virtually unanimously to become part of Australia as an Australian Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cooperative is a commercial venture which has links in Western Australia and operates a business there. It has operated the islands on the basis of a cooperative type arrangement where everyone is employed either by the cooperative or the Council and they share the income. This has been done so that there would not be a large number of haves and have-nots on the islands. That is changing, but it is very difficult to cope with on an island where there is not a substantial economic base and insufficient full paid work for a good percentage of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cocos Islands have, fortunately, been virtually free of any incidents which would require a criminal regime. Since 1984, there have been regular consultations with the people of the islands. There have been some unfortunate incidents, particularly one involving two people who visited the islands with a committee. They told the leaders of the community that the sooner the islands were given back to Clunies-Ross and the people went back to their proper place of being slaves for Clunies-Ross, the better. They are both conservative senators, I might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, most people who have had anything to do with the islands will say that the leaders of those islands are people of stature, people who know what they want and know how to express themselves. Certainly, there has been no lack of consultation and no haste about this legislation. A valid criticism would be that tardiness has been the name of the game and it has taken much too long to get into this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christmas Island is a different situation, although it was originally settled by the Clunies-Ross family and one other. Christmas Island was a phosphate mine&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. Until 1978 it was operated by the British Phosphate Commission and, until some time in the 1980s&mdash;not the 1950s&mdash;New Zealand played a role in the administration of that island as well as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem on Christmas Island has always been that it was dependent on the one industry and one company, which ultimately became uneconomic, leaving a largely itinerant population. There are very few people on Christmas Island who have been there for 20 years. The population is largely itinerant and without an economic base. A great deal of them moved to Western Australia, some to Port Hedland, to seek work. There are still at least 2,000 people on Christmas Island&mdash;the major population was up to 5,000 at one stage&mdash;who are entitled to be treated, as far as the law is concerned, as being equal to other Australians and having the same access to the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who believes that this legislation is going through in haste or that in some way we can put it off for six months so that we can have another committee look at this Committee's reports or find some other way to defer doing anything ought to think again and think of the people concerned. I have already mentioned that two trials for serious offences have taken place on that island where it is doubtful that the conduct of those trials would have been acceptable anywhere in Australia or under any form of British law, other than on that island, where we had this peculiar situation of attributing a law which was not even capable of being updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this legislation. It has been too long in coming, and I am one of those who must take responsibility for that. It is the appropriate way in which to apply a law to an area which is not of sufficient size and is never going to generate sufficient legal activity to acquire the sophistication or the case law which would be necessary if we passed special laws for two islands representing 3,000 to 4,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects of the law in respect of people who visit those islands, who pass through those islands. There are many ocean-going yachts which go through the Cocos Islands group. Some stay an awfully long time and leave their bottles on the reefs, for which we should put them in gaol if we could catch them. Nevertheless, this is important legislation to a body of Australians who are very remote from the rest of us but who are very proud to be Australians, who chose to be Australians by their own vote in the case of the Cocos Islands, who chose to be Australian residents when the opportunity was offered in the case of Christmas Island, and who want to be treated before the law in the same way as anyone else in Australia as we approach the end of the twentieth century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions tonight. Despite the temptation, I will not detain the House by summing up at any length. There are one or two matters I want to mention. I believe that my colleagues the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have more than adequately dealt with most of the matters raised by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just say to the honourable member for Maranoa that I thought it was unfortunate and unfair that he should reflect on the officers of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. I believe they should not only be thanked for their diligence and commitment but should also be recognised for the amount of work they have been doing in recent months to get the Territories Law Reform Bill to this stage tonight. I believe this is an historic time, and in a few moments we will pass this legislation through this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to another matter. Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats has sought an assurance that the Commonwealth Government will provide sufficient resources to enable the Territories' communities to participate effectively in the continuing consultation process on law reform. I am happy to give that assurance. I have already given such assurances in a letter of 18 June 1992 to the Chairman of the Christmas Island Assembly. The Commonwealth Government fully supports consultation with both local communities. That is why I have already provided legal advisers to the islands at Commonwealth expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue to provide whatever assistance I can to ensure that there is effective consultation. I have asked the island administrators, the community legal advisers and my Department to provide as much assistance as possible. Together with the assistance being provided by Western Australian agencies, I expect these resources to be sufficient. However, I have indicated that, if that is not the case, I would be prepared to consider any proposal from the island communities representative bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on at length about the consultations that have taken place over a number of years and the intensity of those consultations in the recent six months and I could detail them. I will not do that, other than to assure the House that the consultations will continue. Communities on both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have the Government's assurance that we will be working very closely with them, the Assembly, the Council and their representatives to make sure that the legal regime which is to be introduced shortly will bring to those communities the benefits that have been so eloquently referred to tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I thank honourable members who spoke tonight. Finally, for the benefit of the honourable member for Maranoa, I just mention that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) expressed considerable unhappiness during the debate on the Government's response to the Committee's report in October 1991 that changes were not to occur before 1 July 1992. I join with my colleagues on this side of the House to say that it is utter nonsense to suggest there is a sudden rush to introduce this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the proverbial horse has well and truly bolted in respect of this legislation. It seems rather strange that we are debating the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill when, in effect, the main Bill has been passed, although we are technically dealing with two other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, earlier this evening I wanted to follow up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on this Bill. I was pleased to hear that he was concerned about violence and sexual exploitation of women in the media. I take it from what he said at the time that he was serious about it; yet I did not detect a great deal of enthusiasm from his side of politics for doing very much about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, it occurred to me to ask at the time: why has the Government not taken the action it could have taken to prevent the importation of X-rated videos, which are readily available,  or have been until recently, throughout Australia via the ACT? I understand there is now some move for that distribution to be carried out from the Northern Territory. As I understand it, the Federal Government has the power under the Customs Act to prevent the importation of that material. Why has it not done that? As the honourable member for Stirling is so concerned about those sorts of matter, if he were still in the chamber I would challenge him to answer that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the Broadcasting Services Bill has been handled is quite amazing. The people of Australia ought to be concerned about the way this important matter has been handled by the Government right from the start. There was a fiasco in the Senate last night. I have read in today's Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> what happened there. Earlier we talked about the whole thing being a dog's breakfast; it certainly was. The guillotine that was applied there, with the support of the Australian Democrats, meant that the whole debate was taken to a point where all sorts of amendments were carried without explanation and senators were voting for things about which they knew nothing. There was even a situation where a particular motion was recommitted and some of the Democrats who had voted for it decided, once they understood what they had voted for, to vote against it. The whole process was repeated here tonight and we were forced virtually to deal with this very important legislation in a very short time. I happen to believe that this is a very important issue. I suspect it is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have dealt with in this Parliament since I have been a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remarks I do not intend to shed a great deal of light on the technical aspects of the debate. The whole spectre of pay television does not get me terribly excited. I am quite happy with the television coverage we already have. I watch the ABC most of the time and I hope I will be able to continue to do that. I have no doubt that, under a coalition government, the ABC will continue to flourish. However, we are to have pay television for whatever reasons, although I suspect most Australians probably do not care too much about it; they do not need it and they do not particularly want it. Nevertheless, we are to have it. This legislation deals in large part with the mechanics of the introduction of pay television in Australia. I do not have a great understanding of the technical aspects of it; nor, I think, do many members on either side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did concern me about the whole process was the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in it. It seems that he has an obsession with being seen as a man of action. It does not matter what sort of action; he is not concerned whether it is good or bad&mdash;as long as he is seen to be doing something. In this particularly important area we had the spectre that we are all fully aware of half of the decisions being made on the run, as has been described. That is unfortunate because this is a very important subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main interest in the legislation is that it focuses attention on the standards which apply to existing television and will, to a large extent, apply to pay television. Already in the debate there has been reference to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies  which was tabled in the Senate a few days ago. The report makes a number of very useful recommendations&mdash;five in fact. I am still at a bit of a loss, with everything that has gone on&mdash;to understand whether all five have been adopted in the legislation. I hope they have. If they have not been I hope they will be at some future point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this evening the Government did accept recommendation No. 2, which I happen to think is particularly important, and that is that the proposed Australian Broadcasting Authority conduct extensive Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television on what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed and what other matters should be included for viewing by parents and children in the various classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important recommendation, as are the others by this Senate Select Committee. The Committee did an extremely good job and I congratulate the Chair, Senator Margaret Reynolds; the Deputy Chair, Senator Walters; and other members of the Committee on the results of their inquiry. I hope that note will be taken of it and that the recommendations will be adopted, if they have not been accepted already. As I have said, with everything that has gone on and the mishmash of hundreds of amendments floating around in the Senate at one stage, it is difficult to determine whether that has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the second recommendation because I was surprised to read recently that the Chief Censor made a statement to the effect that in 20 years there had been no qualitative or quantitative research into what people's actual expectations were of the sorts of standards that ought to apply. Here we have censorship classifications being determined without reference to what people expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, as it is currently called, recently admitted that complaints about sex, violence, language and nudity on television had increased substantially in recent years. Channel 9 came in for special reference because its two cultural gems, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances</EMPHASIS> and Sophie Lee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sex</EMPHASIS> show, were singled out as being two particular programs that were subject to a large number of complaints. That does not surprise me at all, having glanced only casually at each of those programs on the odd occasion. In my view, they are rubbish. That view may not be shared by everybody, but it occurs to me that they have very little cultural value at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Particularly the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sex</EMPHASIS> program. I will say a few words about that in a moment. The joint program director of Channel 9, Mr Blomfield, said in defence of these programs that Channel 9 does not consider itself to be an electronic baby-sitter and trotted out the usual defence that if people do not want to watch the programs they can switch them off. He also said that parents were responsible for monitoring what their children watched. I agree with that. I think that most parents accept responsibility for monitoring what their children watch on television. It is certainly a responsibility that parents ought to have. But the problem, unfortunately&mdash;and I do not know whether Mr Blomfield is aware of it&mdash;is rather more complex than that, in my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideally parents supervise their children, but these days more and more kids are unsupervised for a lot of very good reasons. Very often both parents have to work; sometimes they do shift work. It is a fact of life that a large number of children these days are not supervised to the extent that they ought to be and they are watching these programs. Recent survey results showed that almost the peak viewing time for youngish children was between 7.30 and 8.30 p.m. and a considerable number of children were still watching after 8.30 p.m. If they are unsupervised, that is a problem. If their parents are aware that they are watching such programs, I am not sure whether it is a larger or a smaller problem, but it is still a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to admit that censorship is a difficult area. There are diverse views about the extent to which we should have censorship. But I have no doubt that it is essential to maintain decent standards in the community for I am quite sure that people are affected by what they see, hear and read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently there was a mass murder at Strathfield. As it transpired, the man responsible for that horrific series of events in the Strathfield shopping centre was reading, amongst other things, a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">American Psycho</EMPHASIS>. It is graphic and unbelievably violent. I certainly have not read it but I have read about it. It deals in depth with sexual perversion and a whole range of other degrading subjects. It really is a disgusting book. Psychologists tell me that there is no doubt that the man who perpetrated that dreadful crime was influenced by what he had been reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people may have seen the graphic interview of serial killer Ted Bundy in America on the night before he was executed. For anyone who has not seen that, it is fairly widely available. There was a long interview with this man, who had killed many young girls. He was asked about what had caused his problem. Essentially, it boils down to the fact that he had been exposed to pornography, starting off with soft core pornography. Within hours of his going to the electric chair, or whatever they did to him, Ted Bundy said that he started off going to the corner store and it went on from there. That is where his problems started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of evidence, and there is plenty of other evidence, is enough to convince me that we do have a responsibility to govern what is available for people. It is not just a question of open slather and saying, `Well, whatever people want to see is okay; it is up to them to make those decisions'. I believe that we have a responsibility and the community expects us as their elected representatives to make decisions about what the limits should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we hear from Channel 9? Let me pick up on that theme for a moment. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sex</EMPHASIS> show may attract ratings, but I cannot see any sense in which it is a serious discussion about very important issues. Sex education is important, but in no way is that program a serious attempt to canvass issues. Sophie Lee, who anchors the program, is the person who used to appear on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bugs Bunny Show </EMPHASIS>every afternoon with very little clothing on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to stray too far from the legislation, but we are in a difficult position. The main Bill has already been passed, which makes this a rather strange exercise from the start. I welcome the changes that are foreshadowed in relation to the proposed formation of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. I do not think that the former tribunal ever did its job very well. It made life terribly difficult for my local community radio station, 4CRB. It harassed it at every turn, and I am very pleased that we are now to see automatic licence renewal. That is a big step forward. I hope that 4CRB, which is a very good community radio station, will not be haunted by the ABA, as it has been by the Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. There are some things that need to be addressed in relation to the issue of pay television and the way it has come before the House. It rather disturbs me when one sees that four Ministers have dabbled in pay television and that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently dabbled in it. It seems unfortunate because the general thrust of the Bill and the overhaul of it are very good. The shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), has recognised that we do have a general consensus in the thrust of the Bill. But when we come to the difficult issue of pay television, there are some fundamental questions we ought to be asking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would dearly like to hear the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) address questions such as these: why introduce pay TV now, in the middle of the worst recession we have had for 60 years? Why should those valued resources go into pay TV? What will be the effect on the economy? Is the equipment that we will be using, first of all for the transponders and for the receivable equipment in the home, imported equipment or is it equipment that will be manufactured here in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether we are in fact diverting valuable sources of capital into this area. Quite frankly, it would not matter greatly if pay TV did not come in for another two, three or four years. It would not affect our standard of living one iota and I do not think the nation would feel underprivileged or Third World if it did not have pay TV in the next 12 or 18 months. I would like to see the Minister follow that financial impact question through because I do not think it has been researched well enough. I also think we have rushed into this. Maybe with a little more time and little more consideration we could have had bipartisan support on the various aspects of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Government has failed to explain how it intends to handle things when digital compression comes in. One player with four transponders is likely to end up with 16, 20 or 28 channels, as one of the previous speakers said, because of digital compression. If one player in the area has that much clout and that ability to control the system, I wonder how we will handle it three, four or five years down the track when the technology catches up with us. Those are the things which ought to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion has been that to release those transponders to four individual players, including the ABC, would somehow not be profitable. That seems to fly in the face of logic. Why would it not be profitable? Why would one company owning four transponders run one, two or three of them at a loss and make a huge profit out of the other one? That does not seem to make any sense at all. Each operation, if it is a proper business, would end up covering its own needs, services and requirements. Therefore, it seems that that possibility should have been resourced in the marketplace. Do we have any evidence that those people who would like to invest would not be just as happy with one transponder rather than four, with the associated huge capital costs? With digital compression there is the possibility to expand that one service to four, six or eight. The range of possibilities in this area is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we start researching this subject we come to the fact that the experts predict that by the year 2000 most television will be carried by fibre optics. So we are setting up a system which the experts are already predicting will be out of date. One wonders once again: why the indecent haste by the Government? Why did it rush into this so quickly? Why did the Prime Minister jump in, boots and all, obviously without getting a considered opinion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Question Time yesterday he turned around, looked at the back bench and said, `They're all experts on pay television'. Quite clearly, everyone in this House has an opinion on it, but to say we are all experts is, of course, a nonsense. But it does show me that honourable members have a passionate interest in it and in the way it affects their electorates. We need to make sure that, whatever path we take, there is a good understanding that it will be in the best interests of Australia. I do not think we have that understanding at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of service we are getting has not been identified properly. We have not researched the possibility of whether one of those transponders should be used for education. We have the tragic state of affairs where some 50,000 people could not get into university last year and we have here a technical vehicle which can reach people. Should an education channel have perhaps been offered to these people or is there a better way of going about it? What community service obligation will be imposed on the players? We know that some people who are less well off and less mobile will perhaps use pay television. Those who cannot attend theatres, concerts, art galleries and other bits and pieces within the community which are not readily accessible to them may very well use this medium if it is properly put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not so in the Bill. The Government seems to have a free range attitude: let us see what happens and where it takes us and then we will sort out the mess afterwards. I do not think it is quite good enough to have that attitude toward a Bill of this importance. While I agree with as little interference in business as possible, something that is so very powerful in our community ought to be thought through thoroughly. That is something one could not say has happened to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have much concern in another area. I accept that the Government has received an amendment with regard to this. It has discussed this issue and taken it up. I recommend that honourable members read the final report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies&mdash;I guess the name of the paper is just about as long as its contents. However, the subject is a very serious one. It relates to community standards. Community standards and their portrayal not only on television but also right across the media is an issue that I am very much aware of. Complaints about this have come through my office and it is quite clear that people are concerned and upset when community standards are breached through mediums, such as television, which go straight into the home and when children are exposed to things which parents would prefer that they were not exposed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that whilst adults have rights to as little censorship as possible in this area, we are also custodians of the rights of our children. Most of the complaints which are coming through my office are from people who are very worried about the standards today. People tell me that the covers of magazines in local newsagencies no longer necessarily portray accurately what is inside the magazines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case in point was a motorcycling magazine which was pointed out to me the other day. It is quite legitimate for a young boy of 12 or 13 to be interested in motorcycles. But when one opened up the book one found motorcycles draped with naked females in all sorts of provocative positions. We have to wonder whether the book is trying to sell sex or motorcycles or trying to be titillating to a young and vulnerable audience. I think those sorts of things have to be looked at as part of the examination of community standards. I was very pleased to see recommendation No. 2 of the Senate inquiry. It recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the proposed Australian Broadcasting Authority conduct extensive, Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television, on what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed, and what other matters should be included for viewing by adults and children in the various classifications.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is very important. I am rather pleased to say that I believe our community standards have perhaps taken a turn for the better. People are sick and tired of others dictating what they will see and what will go into their own homes. I am very pleased to see that the Government is accepting an amendment to this piece of legislation which will take in that extensive research with regard to the soon to be formed Australian Broadcasting Authority. I am sure it will be staggered at the number of reports which will be fed to it, because the community is clearly looking for a change in standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, one of the things that rather fascinate me about the pay TV proposition, especially when we get the compressed digital signal coming in, when we go to 16 transponders, or something above four, is that it will break down the power that is now wielded by free to air television in the political arena. I think one or two journalists in that arena feel that they have to make stories. It is a good story to rubbish a politician, it is a good story to pull him down on television&mdash;forget about the facts, forget about the content; let us make a good story, let us make news out of it. There is a handful of people in free to air television who delight in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the benefits and spin-offs of pay TV may very well be that there will be so many channels to choose from that the power of these so-called political commentators will be lessened. When they run out of politicians to commentate upon, these political commentators actually turn around and interview each other. That is the latest standard they have reached. I think it is high time these people suffered a little competition because there is no option at the moment with such a restricted number of television channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward very much to the day when pay TV comes in for that particular reason. I look forward to the opportunity of seeing how it will work and the new services that will be delivered to most homes in Australia. I guess I look forward to the day when we are in government and we will be able to clean up those points I have made where there will be too much power in one player. When the compressed digital signals come in and, instead of one player, we have three or four transponders, or 16 or so, that will be cleaned up and we will have a freer market in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the major changes proposed by the Opposition to the Broadcasting Services Bill has, as its objective, the restriction of the right of pay TV operators to broadcast R-rated or other socially offensive material. The Opposition parties have sought to have this restriction written into the Act at this point of its inception. They have done so because experience ought to have demonstrated that once the Act is up and running it will be near impossible to impose an additional set of requirements upon operators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Parliament has dealt with matters of this type in the past in respect of free to air broadcasting. It has tried repeatedly to cultivate a stronger sense of social concern on the part of broadcasters. All we have won is a bit of warm talk from the networks, a few token efforts at bringing their own house in order. Currently, the power to restrict the broadcasting of pornographic, indecent or excessively violent or perverse material of other kinds is contained in section 118 of the Broadcasting Act 1942. It is also exercised through programming standards as broadly defined by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Neither of these avenues for exercising a uniform and socially constructive influence over broadcasters has been especially successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the existing provisions for making broadcasters more circumspect in the material they put to air is intended to reflect community standards, the truth is that networks have stretched the concept of acceptable standards as far as possible. Broadcasters mouth the right words; they lay claim to rigorous self-examination and self-regulation. They run advertisements featuring their more credible figures, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program's Jim Wiley, as evidence of their high-minded seriousness in doing their best for the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they run <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances</EMPHASIS>, a piece of mindless and demeaning soft core pornography, which is about the lightest commentary one could put on it. Viewers are not even given a choice whether to watch this program. Its explicit previews are run persistently through a range of time slots and other programming schedules. Families have to endure advertisements for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chances</EMPHASIS> appearing at any moment. So there is no viewer choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The free to air networks have persistently and deftly slipped through the regulatory framework which was intended to bring some regard for community sensitivities on these issues. The code of industry practice which sprang from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report into violence on television is a case in point. There are no policing mechanisms or penalties. There is no strong, articulated, defined stance as to what is to be expected or not. It is the perfect expression of a bureaucratic response to a complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the ABT has found, broadcasters clearly are incapable of balancing commercial demands with social responsibility. They are inherently unable to either identify or reflect the strength of community opinion on issues of violence and sexual permissiveness. So when it comes to establishing a new network which has power to access a massive range of new, so-called popular televised material, we had better get the relevant Act in order from day one. It is for this reason that the Opposition parties are seeking to amend the Bill so that the Act itself provides an unambiguous directive to the new operators as to the minimum standards the community expects of its role as a broadcaster, even one that is not free to air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pay TV option was a political option by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It was driven by a political agenda. It was constructed hastily and without consultation with relevant Ministers. The model is economically not viable and it is socially regressive as well. It is flawed, not just at the administrative level, in its capacity to deliver public policy; it is flawed in regard to its social impact as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no perspective whatsoever on the importance of ensuring that the pay TV option it has proposed will ensure prevailing community sensitivities as to what constitutes appropriate standards of broadcasting are recognised. The Opposition has, therefore, pressured the Government to remove the right of operators to use pay TV as a conduit for soft pornography or other material. There should be no debate, no flexible, broadly defined criteria to allow new networks to slip through the ropes. R-rated material should be banned outright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills show that the Government has taken the soft option by imposing standards of conventional decency on pay TV operators. It has gone for the old chestnut policy of introducing codes of practice to be developed by all broadcasters within the various areas of program classification: when in doubt about standards in broadcasting, always go for the self-imposed, industry driven and defined code of practice. This will get us nowhere. We will find we will be back here in this chamber in a short time, soon after the operator is up and running, and we will be dealing with community expressions of concern about the standards of broadcasting on pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsible Minister does not seem to care. In a stunning moment of contrived naivety by one who works so hard to sound world weary, the Minister for Transport and Communications has claimed in the pages of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, in reply to a question on notice on 16 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not foresee the circumstances whereby pay TV would include anything that would offend accepted community standards.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us face it, the Government has given no thought to this matter. It pays no regard to these genuine community concerns at all. It will ride roughshod over them. Indeed, the Government does not care less what is shown on pay TV. The Minister for Transport and Communications has openly revealed his hand in this regard. When asked in the Senate, again on 16 June, as to what he considered was an appropriate standard of program to be broadcast on the proposed pay TV channel, he declared he did not care less. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental truth about pay TV is that if people want to pay to watch crud, that is what will be broadcast to them.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the Minister would like to wrap himself in an egalitarian cloak in this regard. He would like to see himself as a fair-minded democrat who thrives on the simple delights of popular culture. But in doing so he is acting with the same arrogance of mind that characterises those who would arbitrate on what is and what is not high culture. There is no difference. It is just prejudice of a different order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple matter is that the community expects the Government to express public views about the basic social standards that ought to apply to programs broadcast on television. It is the basic responsibility of a democratically elected parliament to listen and to reflect these standards. This is not a question of arbitrating on popular taste. It is not an authoritarian intervention in the private lives of the community. It is not undemocratic. It is simply expressing the community acceptance that the standard of programming which ought to be broadcast publicly on a fee paying basis or a free to air basis is not up for grabs, that there are people in the community, especially children, who should not be exposed&mdash;either intentionally, incidentally or accidentally&mdash;to programs which reflect socially negative or destructive values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a genuine fear in the community that pay TV will become a vehicle for the soft porn industry. The Parliament should not mislead the community about that industry greedily eying the prospects of the introduction of pay TV. It most certainly is. There is also genuine fear that excessively violent programs will be able to be viewed by the young. This might be the crud, as the Minister explains, which people should be able to pay for easily, but it is also the programming material that the wider community finds offensive and will happily seek to be controlled in some purposeful manner. It is the programming material that those who are genuinely worried about the well-being of the community, and of the young in particular, wish to see the Parliament act on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly an intrusion on democracy when the Parliament is petitioned to act on the question of programming standards. It is hardly an intrusion on privacy when the community calls on the Parliament to reflect its own basic expectations of what the socially acceptable minimum standards of television ought to be. This is not a new issue. No-one in the Parliament should be surprised to hear the community voice its concerns in these regards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move towards the imposition of self-regulation and other forms of control of violence, coarse language and sexually explicit material on television, on video tapes and in published materials all bear testimony to continuing community concerns. These issues were driven by a community which genuinely desires some leadership in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider public does want the Parliament to uphold some basic standards of decency in the broadcast media. It does not want the Parliament to be the arbiter in a political way or to define what is good or bad taste at the level of fine detail. However, contrary to what the Government seems to think, the public does not believe that every community standard is up for bidding in the development of the broadcast sector. The community simply believes that there are limits to what is tolerable, and it seeks the same recognition from the elected Government. The community demands leadership from the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share many of the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), but I would like to place a slightly greater emphasis on a worry I have about violence on television. I think there is an enormous problem. Earlier the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) commented on some experience with criminals in gaols. I find it appalling that every time there is a conflict between individuals on television, they seem to have to resolve it in a violent fashion. I cannot see that that is necessary. It certainly is an overkill&mdash;if I can use that expression&mdash;and I think it is totally unnecessary. There is a very good reason for us to adopt the recommendations to which my colleagues and other honourable members have referred. I agree with them, although I did not intend to speak on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the nature of this debate. There is obviously a financial crisis in the Labor Party. I am told that the reason we are dealing with this legislation and with the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is that there are suggestions of some compensation being payable to the Labor Party in order that it might be able to absolve its debts, providing this legislation goes through in its present form. I do not know whether there is evidence to that effect. There certainly is adequate evidence of the bankruptcy of the New South Wales Labor Party organisation. There are circumstances in which, because of the way the Western Australian Party, the Victorian Party, the South Australian Party and the New South Wales Party have been performing, the Labor Party is in a crisis of confidence which makes its fundraising extraordinarily difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the Labor Party has accelerated the whole process of public funding. It has contained political broadcasting and it is now introducing legislation which it is suggested may bring to the Labor Party contributions to offset benefits that might be gained. If that is so, there is absolutely no reason why this legislation should go through by 30 June, which I am told is the date by which the whole thing needs to be dealt with. To my mind, that makes this debate at 1.35 a.m. on Friday, a time when the House is supposed to be up, absolutely ridiculous. There is reason for us to be concerned about that aspect, and I will be very curious to see whether at some time we will find out that funds have been paid to the Labor Party as a result of the passage of this legislation or because of benefits to be rendered. Were that to be so, it would raise quite serious doubts about the purpose of this debate at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the Broadcasting Services Bill, which has passed this House and is coming back at a later stage, and the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill are developments that must be commended. I would that we could get a consolidation of the tax law in the way that we are getting a consolidation of the broadcasting law. I particularly compliment the officials of the Department of Transport and Communications, some of whom I have spoken to. There is no doubt that they have put enormous effort into this legislation, and it is great that it is here. I also compliment the Parliamentary Counsel. I think the progress towards getting, at least in one place, a Bill that people can peruse and understand is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional provisions are necessary to enable the change from the present system to the new. The concept is good and I compliment those who have been involved in it. It represents a great deal of work. While there are some amendments and modifications, they seem to be more of a political character than they are of substance. I think everybody who has been involved deserves to be complimented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the legislation there are a number of aspects to which I would like to pay some attention. The first is the creation of the ABA. There has been some debate here about the new Australian Broadcasting Authority to take over from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I have real doubts about the way in which the ABT has been performing, and I would hate the ABA to succeed in that same tradition. I do not believe it should be peculiarly a legal forum. It should not be a forum in which only senior counsel can appear and in which the individual applicant finds it extraordinarily difficult to have his point of view heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all that there is a change in the licensing arrangements and some of the past procedures, which have been extraordinarily difficult, particularly for small or regional broadcasters, have been removed, there is still the suggestion that there will be a great deal of legal involvement. Under the new legislation, the need for a new range of decisions to allow certainty as to what the legislation means will inevitably provoke greater legal involvement, at least in the early days of those matters that come before the ABA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that we achieved in the past was appointing people from the industry, not just from the Bar and from the legal fraternity. In my day, a number of people from the industry were appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal who made a tremendous contribution. One in particular, a Mr Archer, came from commercial radio, and he knew what it was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole trouble with this field is that it is extraordinarily complex technically. It is essential that people understand something of the problems of a technology which is advancing probably more rapidly than in almost any other field. There have to be people out there who are not just involved at a legal level; they have to know how the industry is going to affect the community. I say to the Government that I believe it is absolutely essential that we get a few people with a practical understanding of the industry. It should not make it too legal a forum, but allow some ordinary commercial commonsense to intrude. In that way we might get a far better interpretation of this new legislation than would otherwise be possible. So ABA changes are generally welcome. There is concern about the membership and certainly a worry that it should not become too much of a legal administrative tribunal, although I have little doubt that in this new legislation there will be a tendency for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second field that worries me is the field of the electronic media and what I see as major problems that flow from aggregation. I was fascinated to hear the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) earlier in this debate talk about what he saw as the advantages of aggregation to country people. He is mad. He does not know what it is about. I can tell him that in my area people who used to be able to get one or two channels now can generally get one. We are told that the ABC as of 1 July will go to UHF. The people in my area will finish up getting one channel, and that will be a commercial channel. Because of aggregation, whereas all the best commercial programs used to go to that one channel, now the viewer gets very little.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but in places such as Tenterfield in the northern end of New England viewers used to be able to get an occasional reception from either Toowoomba or Brisbane. They now get no television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are going to get pay television, which I will come to in a moment, but there are a lot of people in relatively closely settled areas of eastern Australia&mdash;I cannot speak with the same knowledge of Western Australia and other parts&mdash;who did receive television and who now, because of aggregation and the introduction of UHF transmission, because of the failure to have sufficient translators to cover every nook and cranny and hill and the line of site transmission, are getting no free to air television reception at all. It is not satisfactory. It is a distinct product of the changes that this Government has introduced because it moved away from the supplementary licence scheme, which I promoted way back in the days when I was Minister for Communications. I feel very sad that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand that there have been some threats that commercial radio would go in the same direction. I am pleased to see there are some changes in this legislation which I believe will avoid that. But I am told by those who know in commercial radio and regional areas that they fear the same consequences could apply to commercial radio as apply to commercial television if care is not exercised in the way in which new licences are issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous problems. What is the minimal population size to justify an additional licence? For years there were only two licences in Perth. At that stage people said, `Well, the market is big enough to take another licence'. In fact, I am still doubtful whether markets such as Perth can viably justify three commercial stations. Certainly the result of the changes of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to cross-media ownership has been disastrous for the networks when aligned with a break-up of those older established media empires, when the Fairfax empire went and so on. We now have three major networks, all of which, except Channel 9, which has been taken back by Mr Kerry Packer, have questionable viability. I am concerned that we should not do that to radio, and I am concerned that, by forcing aggregation, we should not do it to regional television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told, although I find it a little difficult to understand, that there is a problem in programming if we go to the introduction of too much competition too soon. The realities of commercial life mean that everybody, apparently, will try to concentrate for the mainstream audience. If one goes for the mainstream audience, one apparently gets no complementary programs. In other words, those who listen to commercial radio are apparently in a far narrower spectrum of the listening audience. They cover those who are apparently from 19 to 24 years of age. In that spectrum, unless one provides loud rock music and programs of that sort, one is in strife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that that should not happen in commercial radio. I believe that changes in the amended legislation have avoided that, but I am concerned that we are now getting less variety and less competition in the electronic media than as of yesteryear. The results of the cross-media bars have led to concentration of ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report of the Select Committee on the Print Media, in which I put in a dissenting report, I mentioned that in my view country Australia would be far better off without those cross-media laws because originally country newspapers contributed to country radio, which contributed to country television, and they started the networks. Now we have concentration in the separate print, radio and television media and we are getting more and more syndicated news, less local news and less localism. As far as aggregation is concerned, it has meant that, instead of having decent production houses in country television stations, we have very little. I do not want that to happen in radio, and I think it is a tragedy that it is happening in television. I am very uncertain whether the cross-media laws in this new legislation are in the best interests of competition, diversity and localism. I doubt that they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that there have been changes in this Broadcasting Services Bill from the original draft, but I am still apprehensive that there might be a tendency to concentrate on the provision of rock programs and not the complementary programming. That has certainly been a feature of some of the single station networks, which I think now need supplementary licences so we get more programs but do not start concentrating our market unduly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area I want to address briefly is pay TV. Another one of the absolute messes that this Government has made in administration is what happened to Aussat. The Aussat first generation of satellite would have provided pay TV opportunities 10 years ago, or at least seven or eight years ago, if this Government had not transferred ownership to Telecom. The whole problem has been that the main competitor would not let Aussat do what it was designed to do. Exactly the same consequence could flow from the intervention of the Prime Minister in the second generation of satellite. He does not have any idea of what he is doing. What he is doing is trying to placate the Left faction and the Right faction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have honourable members seen anything more ridiculous than the final package&mdash;which has been changed half a dozen times since&mdash;that went before Caucus? It came out of a discussion, not with the members of Cabinet present, not with the Minister responsible for communications present, not with all those people who generally should be involved at a government level in determining government policy. Oh, no, it was with the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and Senator Schacht. What the devil were they there for? They were there because they are the power brokers of two factions who apparently have a capacity to deliver, to get this through the Caucus. I have never heard of a more ridiculous policy formulating process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is being compounded because day after day, week after week and every time the Prime Minister meets somebody else, he says, `Oh, we are going to change this; we are going to change that'. He comes in here in Question Time with package No. 37 varied by something else. It is no way to develop policy in an extraordinarily sensitive and important area. I am appalled that we are in a situation where pay television and what it means is dominating a Bill that covers every field of electronic communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we could have had pay TV out of the first generation of satellites if this Government had not provided monopoly ownership through Telecom. It took away the involvement that all these commercial networks had years ago. </PARA>

As I have just tried to explain, we are going to get less free on air television. We are going to have less opportunity for people in remote areas to even take the pay TV. All the new technological developments, from fibre optics to digital concentration and all those things, are mentioned here, but not in the pay TV package. The pay TV package is headed down there&mdash;on a steamboat to China I was going to say, but it is heading too fast. It is more of a rocket boat to Bondi. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to hear the suggestion by the Opposition spokesman for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), that the ABC should have one of these channels. I think that is a great idea. One of our troubles in the bush is that the only decent country programs we can generally get, because the ABC has the right end of the spectrum, come out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> and some of their regional networks. As soon as they are pruned for a bit of cash, they try to cut back there. At least if the programs are up in the satellite, there might be a few of those bush programs that are of a genuine advantage in market information and community programs and whatever. Those programs might be able to continue. But the way this Government is going, those programs are not going to be there, because the ABC will not be able to afford them under the Government's ABC opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the four-two situation&mdash;four in the first year and two after that&mdash;it just does not make economic sense; nor do the footprints that the Government wants to allow for the second generation Aussat satellite. </PARA>

There are sections of it, however, that are extraordinarily complex.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the right honourable member says, they have not got the jobs and therefore the money. So one wonders what it is all about. Taking a slightly longer view, if we are going to tackle this unemployment problem, we have to make some very fundamental changes in this economy. We might say that in the midst of this recession we would certainly like to see a bit more spending, but in the medium to longer term it is not a matter of looking for more consumerism, if I can use that word. In this country we have to achieve a situation where we can make room for investment and additional net exports so we can begin to pay our way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a huge overseas debt. If we include not only the debt but the net equity liabilities, as stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> that came out a couple of weeks ago, it was just short of $200 billion. If in the normal situation we had a return of even 10 per cent on that, it is about $20 billion, or more than $1 1/2 billion a month, or about $80m a day extra into hock. That build-up to $200 billion referred to in the last issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> was from $192.5 billion at the end of December. I am talking about the 31 March figure. So in this country we had about a $7 billion build-up of extra borrowing, extra into hock, extra liabilities, over that three-month period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might just pause and wonder what this rush is all about. In part, it is about the Aussat situation, to which the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred. I guess there is a guarantee somewhere in the background, as part of the sale of Aussat, that the pay TV business would be provided to the buyer; not to mention the financial situation of the Labor Party to which the right honourable member referred. These are the real reasons for all this feverish distractionary activity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to pay TV and aviation. The motivation to get that privatisation through was to get the sight of an extra billion dollars for an election Budget in August. We can go from one to the other: plus dealing with the desires of the mates. I guess we can rationalise it all. We do not really have the Australian consumers out there bursting for this additional bit of consumerism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the unemployment situation, with a million unemployed and 500,000 underemployed and what needs to be done. In my opinion, this sort of feverish concentration on the provision of pay TV for those who can afford to pay for it is almost obscene. It excludes a lot of people at the present time. I want to make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many members in this place at this crazy hour, rushing this legislation through, really know what we are voting for. It is almost like the situation in the Senate last night, where a vote had to be recommitted while some of the voters got to know what they were voting for and found they were voting for what they did not want, so they were able to vote for what they did want. In that case I am very gratified that the legislation was recommitted. Nevertheless, I wonder how many of us really know. I must say, I am still back with the situation where the first four transponders were to be virtually devoted to initial licensees and they would have those for a year; after that the cashed-up local billionaires could come in on the next two transponders. If that was ever seriously suggested, it was hardly a viable proposition for anybody to take up with that prospect 12 months down the track. From this side we have put an alternative proposition, but I am not sure to what extent it can be or will be accommodated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the formation of the Australian Broadcasting Authority by this legislation. I would commend the fact that, by virtue of the amendment made in the Senate last night and picked up in effect by the Government today, the Parliament has given recognition to the second of the recommendations in the Committee's final report, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the proposed Australian Broadcasting Authority conduct extensive, Australia-wide qualitative and quantitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television, on what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed, and what other matters should be included for viewing by adults and children in the various classifications.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important recommendation and a very important inquiry is proposed there. What that does make very important is who is to be appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The 1988 report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On The Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</EMPHASIS> contains a recommendation regarding appointments to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the predecessor organisation. It stressed at page 86:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . appointments to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal are important and there is a heavy obligation on the Government to appoint members to the Tribunal who understand the community's high expectations of them and who are capable of reflecting the community's standards. The Government should therefore engage in a consultative process before appointments to the Tribunal are made.</PARA>
<PARA>The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made some pertinent comments about the sort of experience that would be required of appointments to this Authority. In addition, this does raise the question of standards. Perhaps this would not be their primary responsibility but they do have this inquiry to undertake. We would require on that body a range of experience and backgrounds. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) called for a high ranking person in the church, and there is reason in that. On this matter of standards, which was dealt with so adequately by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), in this Parliament we do have an obligation and a responsibility to set limits in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This touches on the whole question of censorship, which is a very complex area. I do not profess to speak with authority and it is a very difficult area, but we certainly do have responsibility in the area of the availability of some of the violence we see, as was stressed by the right honourable member for New England. I had occasion a while back in this chamber to say a few words about the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thelma and Louise</EMPHASIS>. I do not know whether anybody has seen it.

There was a murder first, in the early stages; there was robbery on a grand scale; there were guns drawn on a policeman who pulled up the car for speeding and ended up locked in the boot of the car; and there was the destruction of a massive oil tanker. It all ended up with these two women recognising the difficulty of their situation and driving the car over the cliff. There was no scene of the car crashing; they just went to oblivion with the sound of nice music. Okay, it was fair entertainment for adults, but the role of the gun in particular was disturbing, and it followed very closely on the Strathfield massacre. I do not think we can dismiss lightly the enormous impact of these sorts of films, particularly depictions of violence. We do have a responsibility in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how it would be applied to this tribunal, but I read a suggestion recently by a member of the staff of this place, Mrs Connie Steven, who has written on this area. She made the suggestion in relation to censorship&mdash;and it might somehow be applied here&mdash;that we would need a core of permanently appointed people but that the censorship could be conducted by a jury, so to speak, of ordinary Australians which is a constantly changing body drawn from the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must undoubtedly be the case that persons appointed in a role as censor constantly viewing violence and pornographic material must become desensitised to some extent. I cannot imagine that that would not be the case. I believe that the suggestion of Mrs Steven that a body charged with censorship could have this changing composition&mdash;like juries chosen in the courts&mdash;would overcome this problem of desensitisation. I am not sure how that might be fitted in, but in this place we do have a responsibility to set limits and to endeavour to counter socially negative and destructive values in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broader areas of the Bill, which were touched on by the right honourable member for New England, I do not have the knowledge of this Bill that he was able to display. But I do venture the opinion that there was a time until quite recently when in the context of radio and television there were statutory requirements for some measure of religious and specifically Christian broadcasting. I would assert that in Australia, according to the most recent census&mdash;and I do not command the figure immediately&mdash;in the order of 70 to 80 per cent of the population of this country is still avowedly Christian. I believe that to a significant extent one of the factors leading to the abandonment of requirements for that minimum amount of religious and specifically Christian broadcasting is the multicultural situation in this country now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the degree of the practice of other great religions and I respect those religions. But it is still true that 70 to 80 per cent of Australians recorded themselves in the last census as belonging to one of the various denominations of the Christian religion. I deplore a situation in which that statutory minimum of religious and, specifically, Christian religious broadcasting has now, as I understand it, been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislative package is an extremely complex one. I recognise that the time is beyond 2 o'clock in the morning and that we are persisting with this unholy rush to get this legislation through, for the sorts of reasons I have mentioned. There is, no doubt, a commitment by those who invest in Aussat. I have no doubt that, as the right honourable member for New England said, the very serious financial position of the Labor Party may also have something to do with it. It would be a much wiser procedure to delay this very important legislation. It could be reserved for more detailed and prolonged consideration at a different time. </PARA>

One thing we should be cognisant of in this debate tonight is that our colleagues in the Senate, who are delaying the principal broadcasting Bill, took a decision just a moment ago to refer that section of the Bill dealing with pay television to a committee&mdash;the old standby: when in doubt, send it to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) said in his response to that debate, it seemed quite illogical that that particular course of action should be followed when each speaker, in turn, protested that he or she, as a good senator, believed in pay television, but did not want to have it yet, and wanted to send it off to a Senate committee. As the Minister rightly pointed out, we would not want such an outcome. But it is about to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people in this debate have touched on the themes of violence, sex and censorship. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) talked at great length about programs such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sex</EMPHASIS> program on the Nine Network, hosted by Sophie Lee. Concern was also raised by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and others about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place there has been a great deal of debate about violence on television. It is an issue which from time to time has come up in reference to news broadcasting: how much violence should be shown in prime time television? How much footage of the massacres that occur&mdash;perhaps in the recent troubles in South Africa or the violence in Yugoslavia with bodies lying around&mdash;should be witnessed by the public in Australia? If television cameras are there and satellite technology and the like enable us to get almost instantaneous pictures, should people be shown such footage or should a form of censorship be applied to the news and such scenes cut? Should we simply say, `There was a massacre; there was violence in Sarajevo; there was a problem somewhere and people were killed.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As difficult as it may be, it does get into that very important area of censorship. I, for one, believe that, if an item is newsworthy, the opportunity should be available for it to be seen on television, irrespective of whether it is shown in prime time. I also have a view that on many of the programs that carry an AO rating&mdash;an adults only rating&mdash;for television, invariably a warning is carried before the movie, or whatever that program may be, that some scenes may offend some viewers. If that is not an obligation being displayed on behalf of the broadcaster to tell people about what may or may not be in the program, what some people may or may not find offensive, I am clearly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity then exists for people to pick up the remote control or to get up and go over to the television set and turn it off or change the channel, or perhaps to get something else, such as one of the Walt Disney videos that the kids have, and to watch that. There is a whole debate about what is on television and what should be watched. In particular, we have heard a lot of emotive argument tonight about protecting children and determining what they watch. I have four kids, ranging from 5 1/2 to 18 years of age. Like all children, they come home from school; they get into a glass of milk; they run around in the park until it is dark; they come inside to do some homework; and then they decide to watch television. What is the choice for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal regulations to date, some Australian content must be shown on television during the night. Invariably that Australian content seems to fall in that afternoon slot. That Australian content and children's programming often intermix. So, yes, we do get the cartoons coming out of the Walt Disney studios, or whatever studio it may be, shown in the afternoon slot. There is often a degree of violence in cartoons. I know that academic studies have been conducted about the effect of those television programs. Albeit that they are cartoons with Bugs Bunny hitting someone over the head or Yosemite Sam shooting somebody, questions have been asked about whether that will have a detrimental effect on children as they are growing up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there are programs on the commercial and the ABC networks in the afternoon time slot specifically geared for children. I do not know whether too many honourable members in this place watch the ABC. There is a program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Degrassi High</EMPHASIS> shown at about 5.30 p.m.&mdash;I think&mdash;which I watch with my children on those rare occasions when I happen to be at home with my family. It is out of Canada. It depicts, for an age group of between 10 and 14 years of age, difficulties of young adolescents in a high school situation and tries to portray real life situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day, the episode was about a 16-year old boy who had been diagnosed as being HIV positive. This program was shown at 5.30 in the afternoon. It had a clear message. Another episode involved&mdash;so my children related to me&mdash;the issue of whether condom vending machines should have been placed in schools and what that meant for education, safe sex, and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same debates are going on in the schools of Australia. So are we supposed to turn away from those education-type themes that are being played at a time on television when our children are watching before dinner and so on and say, `You are not allowed to watch that because there is real life drama involving a deadly disease and there is real life drama involving the question of safe sex', which then raises the question of family morals, values and so on. Are we simply to say, `You can't watch any of that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to some of the values mentioned here by many people&mdash;the old-fashioned values, I suppose, many people see them as being these days; that is, the responsibility of parents in a family setting to educate their children, to try to bring them up and pass on values that they hold dear to themselves. As parents we also have to temper that with a view that circumstances have changed from when we were growing up although, if we think back, have they changed greatly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife and I try to pass on to our kids our particular views on this and, frankly, I have to say that a television program like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Degrassi High</EMPHASIS> does not concern me greatly. It does not concern me that other episodes come on and tell the tragic tale of some young girl that happened to be pregnant at 14, has had a child and is trying to go through high school to get qualifications while raising a child as a single parent. We have similar problems in Australia. We have those problems in my electorate. I do not think we can simply turn off the television and say that it is unrealistic. It is being displayed there and I think it is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The television programs which many people complain about and have suggested that the changes to this legislation will see blossom and grow and thrive, and in some way be to the detriment of the viewing public of this country, have to be viewed in a much different light. I think that the whole issue of gratuitous violence, gratuitous sex and the role that some television programs play in depicting women in inferior roles, or whatever, should be questioned. There is no doubt about that. I think there is a role for this new body that is to be established to perhaps look at some of those community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what we have to avoid under all circumstances, notwithstanding the various lobby groups, whether they be in the churches or whatever, is turning into a nation of wowsers. We simply have to reflect what society norms are these days. I do not know whether, for all the good and proper reasons that many honourable members have spoken about in this debate, they have cottoned on to those changing values, changing norms and mores. I am not saying that we should jettison them. I am not saying that it is open slather in television. I am not saying that in the pay TV domain we have the channels for the movies and the R-rated movies get a run and so on. I am not saying that we are simply going to have an open book in the whole thing. What I am saying is that in our society today parental control and guidance based on the values which we hold in society and each of us develop in our own way can be translated through to our children and, if it is reflected in television programming that we are watching at present, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put that view, I have to say that there is so much drivel around on television, some of it in the guise of Australian content, because it has to be there, that I find it absolutely incredible that some of those programs could even get through. Some time ago we heard of the ABT banning <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat and Friends</EMPHASIS> because Fat Cat in some way was not a real character and was not developing the appropriate attitudes in our children. Can honourable members imagine the appropriate attitudes that a four-year-old is supposed to develop by watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat and Friends</EMPHASIS> on TV?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do find objectionable is watching a program at 7.30 such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">E Street</EMPHASIS> where some deranged psychopath is running around half-painted, half-naked, attacking and kidnapping people and so on in prime time viewing. It is at a time when people&mdash;whether they be from age five through to 18, as my children are, or even older&mdash;have an opportunity to turn a television program on which is Australian-made, but they are being subjected to that sort of nonsense. Again, the option is always there to turn it off. If I am home at that time and that program happens to come on, it is turned off, I can assure you of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should also pay some attention to the comments made by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and others&mdash;I think it was the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in his contribution earlier this evening&mdash;in respect of aggregation of TV in Australia.

One senior executive was telling me how absolutely fantastic aggregation has turned out to be for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. It is worth commenting at this stage that the House of Representatives should not be in this position. These broadcasting services reforms are longstanding matters. They have been extensively discussed and, frankly, it is disappointing that we have got to a stage where at the eleventh hour the Opposition is proposing amendments that are half baked, ill conceived and very much detrimental to the well-being of broadcasting policy reform in Australia. That is the stage we are at tonight and that is why we are sitting here at 2.30 a.m. trying to get some sense out of the Senate. Having watched the debate in the Senate over the last couple of nights, one can only marvel at the problems honourable senators have in comprehending the magnitude of reforms in broadcasting policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is really important in these arrangements is that we actually get the major reforms of the broadcasting laws that have been outlined. These reforms were the subject of the draft Bill that was presented last December by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). There has been extensive consultation with the community and changes were made as a result of that consultation. A better Bill has been developed and submitted to the Parliament to debate, including significant reforms in the area of pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as important are the provisions which encourage a major rewrite of the broadcasting licensing procedures for the formation of the Broadcasting Authority, the reforms in relation to the provision of control and obtaining of information by the Authority. These are all measures designed to make the licensing procedure more straightforward and to overcome the legal logjam that has developed through hearings with the Broadcasting Tribunal. Those arrangements were often abused either because of difficulties with the way the legislation for the ABT was drafted or, alternatively, because of the manipulation that went on by some who used those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that the legislation outlines are beneficial and will be longstanding reforms, as I think many speakers have already outlined tonight. But it is worth noting the discussions that have gone on in the broadcasting policy area, and certainly some of us on this side have had hours and hours of discussions, meeting all the groups that have an interest in broadcasting policy and pay TV. Throughout all of those discussions there has been the clear view that we needed to ensure first of all that the Broadcasting Authority was put in place and, secondly, that we had an effective pay TV regime that could be developed. That has been the subject of the discussions. All the interest groups that have come to talk to us have made those things clear. Frankly, it is amazing that until 24 hours ago no-one could be entirely clear what the Opposition's policies were in most of these areas. That is very disappointing to people in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the Senate proposed to defer the question of pay TV and refer the matter to a committee. One really has to wonder about the whole parliamentary process when that is allowed to occur. What are the key things that are important about the pay TV decision? One is that we have a regime that encourages the development of technology and the competitive structure of technological development. Certainly the proposals the Government put forward actively encourage that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were always concerned that we should encourage Australian content considerations as part of the pay TV development and, very pleasingly, those arrangements were picked up and adopted. We were concerned that the industry development potential of pay TV should be part and parcel of the process, and that was incorporated in the provisions. We were always keen for the ABC to have the opportunity to bid for pay TV, and that was part of our proposals. We were equally convinced, on the basis of what had been said by the range of groups that had spoken to the Caucus committee, that the potential for the networks in this part of the new technological development was something that should be encouraged, and that was part of our package as well. When we add all those things together, we can see that there is absolutely no basis whatsoever for delaying the implementation of the arrangements for pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, we have the four-channel arrangement which is a contractual commitment in relation to the Optus decision; on the other hand, we have the capacity for transponders 5 and 6 to ensure that the great potential in the area of technological development with cables and fibre optics is able to be encouraged as part of that process. All of those things should have been picked up without the need for the manoeuvring the Opposition has decided to indulge in. As one witnessed the Senate debate it was clear that that was all that was going on, and that is indeed regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key provisions relate to the philosophical questions about the reforms of the Broadcasting Act. It is interesting to note, when we go back through the whole process of our determination to encourage a more competitive and open arrangement in the broadcasting policy area, that the Opposition's response&mdash;even as far back as the print media inquiry&mdash;was to reject the notion that we should have real potential for diversity of ownership, which is one of the things the shadow Minister referred to earlier tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question was the recommendation of the Select Committee on the Print Media to change the basis of ownership from a weakened dominance test&mdash;which was a legacy of the time of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in 1977&mdash;to the substantial lessening of competition test. That Committee rightly decided, with a majority from this side of the chamber, that the substantial lessening of competition test is a proper one if we are really concerned about competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has shown, through its opposition to that change, that it does not really believe in competition, even though we all thought it stood for that. We had doubts, but we thought that was part of its philosophy. As members of the Opposition have been such vigorous opponents of the substantial lessening of competition proposal, it is clear that they do not really believe in competition. The same situation applies to pay TV. The proposals from the Government encourage competition; technological diversity; the capacity for new operators and new media interests to come along with the first four channels; and the development of the broader technological capacity that will no doubt come in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the regime that the Government adopted as to the viability of the first four channels. Indeed, a lot has been said over a long period about the viability of the pay TV operation full stop. It has clearly emerged that there will be people who are interested, under the regime the Government has established, in being part of the first four channel arrangement. Indeed, some of the major players have made that abundantly clear in the past 24 hours. One of the major players stated publicly in the media today that it had been grossly misrepresented by people who said that it was not now interested in the first four channel licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the best thing to have happen is not to have the matter referred to a committee&mdash;a delay, a stalling tactic&mdash;but to allow the regime which the Government decided on to proceed. As a result of that, we will get pay TV introduced at the earliest time and the 4,000 jobs that the Minister for Transport and Communications has referred to, which the Opposition is happy to see go out the window. That is something I do not think should be entertained. If the regime that the Government has proposed had been carried through tonight, as it should have been, the pay TV operator and the Optus people would have known that those arrangements would be carried through as part of the contractual set-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not allowed to occur we will end up with the  crazy proposal which has been canvassed that we should automatically mandate the ABC to transponders Nos 5 or 6. I think that has sent a very unfair message to the great range of interests out there that would want to participate in a legitimate bidding process for channels Nos 5 and 6. Many people around the Parliament today have been pointing out the inequity of a situation where one or two enterprises which might have done a deal with the ABC are automatically dragooned by this means into this arrangement and, at the same time, a vast number of others which might well be competitive interests do not even get the chance to be a part of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us&mdash;indeed, even the Opposition a little while back&mdash;used to believe there should be a genuine bidding process in relation to pay TV. Those opposite made clear over a period of time that they did not believe in a process which meant that someone got an unfair advantage over others with regard to those arrangements. Yet the amendment that the Opposition moved in the Senate has exactly the opposite effect to the view that it had maintained all the way through this process. Those opposite actually believed that market forces should be allowed to operate and make the decision about who would get the pay TV approval. If they reflected at all upon that, they would have to say that their proposal of last night is fundamentally flawed because it basically says, `We don't want the market forces to operate in terms of who gets into pay TV'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had made a conscious decision that it would provide funding to assist the ABC as part of a consortium for the channel 5 and 6 bidding. But at no stage did we say we were going to contrive the bidding process or, effectively, do what the Opposition's proposal does: mandate the ABC for one of the channels. Indeed, I seem to recall the shadow Minister saying how much he was opposed to any mandating of network participation in the first four channels. I seem to recall this being talked about at some length when that was one of the proposals which were canvassed some months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recognised, I think quite rightly, by the Government that the only legitimate process to adopt was to set thresholds as far as Australian content and the industry plan were concerned to ensure that there were basic requirements in terms of meeting the need for essentially Australian ownership of our media. It is recognised that that has significant virtue&mdash;we need to encourage the identification of Australian ownership as part of the culture of our Australian media. Aside from those considerations, it was then going to be left to a market based analysis to decide who would be successful in getting the pay TV licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intriguingly, the Opposition has said, `We don't really think that arrangement is very good. We want to ensure that a couple of people who might have done a deal with the ABC will automatically not have to be part of a financial arrangement that involves a legitimate and a competitive bid with others'. I think that is an untenable position. As a result, the Opposition now says, `This is all getting a bit too hard for us. We're not quite able to think quickly enough and, therefore, we will refer the matter to a committee. It's all a bit too hard'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) about aggregation earlier tonight. I wonder how many rural areas of Australia which have the benefits of aggregation would say, `We'd like you to take it away from us'. I wonder how many viewers out there would actually say, `We don't want the choices; we don't want the options'&mdash;not too many, I suspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, the Opposition is basically unable to grasp the value of this great opportunity to reform our broadcasting laws, and what the innovation of pay TV will mean for Australia and what it will offer Australia. It is unable to understand why we should set up an environment which is competitive, encourages diversity and gives new opportunities to Australian performers and Australian people interested in media development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tragedies of this decision, quite frankly, is the delay. It means that potential employment opportunities in industries which are finding times very hard indeed at the moment will be jeopardised by what can only be seen as a pretty unsavoury and unnecessary approach to the whole issue. There is clearly no need for that sort of delay. No-one should have any reason to fear a process which allows legitimate commercial bidding for the first four channels and, similarly, an open, deregulated approach to transponders Nos 5 and 6, with all of the potential development that offers in terms of technology and scope for new players to come along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are virtually saying here&mdash;and the Opposition even goes a step further and says that it would like to have an individual operator of all of the channels&mdash;is that rather than encourage the range of programming across the channels in relation to news, sport and other entertainment as well as the movie channel, the real issue should be the movie channel because that is where the real interest is. There should not be the necessity to try to encourage the news, the current affairs and the options for people in those areas. It really is a proposal that beggars the whole understanding as to whether the pay TV issue is seriously part of the Opposition's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made all of those points, I come back to the fundamental point; that is, that the Broadcasting Act, this major historic reform, quite logically should include the new media operation pay TV as part of the package. We are now suggesting that we excise that from the package and we will not have a complete broadcasting Bill that should have been a landmark in terms of reform. That is certainly unnecessary. The draft Bill was out last December, and we have had rounds and rounds of consultations about it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is here, could readily attest to the hours and hours that we have spent discussing this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the needs of the rural and remote communities are properly addressed and given real impetus. Despite all the misrepresentation that has gone on, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Transport and Communications, the Parliamentary Secretary, several of my colleagues and I have had discussions to ensure that people in rural and remote communities get a much better television service than they have had in the past, as well as encouraging a competitive environment for pay TV. All of those things have been incorporated into the Government's proposal, yet it is all a bit too hard for the Opposition to be in a position to formulate a view. It needs a committee to look at these things for a great deal longer. It cannot be part of the total Broadcasting Services Bill package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a matter that I think time will show is a short-sighted decision. As I say, I think quite clearly we are in a position where we would have been far better to have had the proposal with the amendments that the Government was prepared to accept, and did accept. I think some of them have considerable virtue, particularly the one that dealt with the powers relating to the intrusive nature of the ABA to be able to go to the courts to get information about journalists, records, programming and so forth. I think that was a provision that needed to be addressed, and I am pleased that amendment has been incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been responsive to some of those constructive amendments. But when we get the sort of proposal on pay TV to say, `This is all too hard for the Opposition. It should go to a committee. The job should be jeopardised. This new technological opportunity in broadcasting policy should be jeopardised', I think it is regrettable and it is something that the Parliament should very much regret as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) for his contribution to this debate. He raised a number of very significant points. The action that the Senate has taken in relation to this issue should be a matter of concern to the whole lot of us here tonight. It must be for some political motive because it is totally irresponsible. There has been a great deal of public consultation and a great deal of discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might remind the House that the issue of pay TV was first considered for Australia as far back as 1972; so it is not as if it has just come onto the agenda. Introducing pay TV into Australia was first recommended in 1982 by a report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which indicated at that point that it favoured its introduction by cable or radiated subscription. A four-year moratorium was placed on pay TV in 1986 following intense TV industry lobbying to give it time to adjust to aggregation and other policy changes. Pay TV is currently operating in all developed English speaking countries, except Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind those facts and the length of the discussion which has taken place in our community generally, and more specifically in a concentrated fashion over the last 12 months, it has to be said that there has been a great deal of discussion, a great deal of debate and a great deal of consultation, with the wider community in terms of the exposure draft of the legislation, with elements of industry, with people who are involved in the performing arts, the importing of film, programming&mdash;every element of the television industry. Indeed, the entertainment industry in the broader sense of the word has been canvassed for its views in relation to this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the way in which the Government has gone about developing its options papers and having discussions both within its Caucus and outside&mdash;in a very public fashion, I might say&mdash;we see that it has done the right thing. There may be some dispute and difference of opinion about some elements of the final package which the Government decided upon, but I do not believe that merits the sort of action which has been taken today by the Senate. If we could give points out of 10 for irresponsibility&mdash;like a negative mark&mdash;this would have to be close to 10. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we would give it one extra. As I have said earlier, this decision demonstrates scant regard for what this Parliament ought to be about in terms of the good government of this country. I think it has been totally irresponsible in terms of the television industry generally and the pay television industry in particular. What does it mean for Optus? What if the Senate in its wisdom decides to keep this thing bubbling along until September, October or whenever it might be, when those honourable senators&mdash;those enlightened people who have such considered and high moral views and such great standards of public probity&mdash;know that Optus will require the cash flow which will come from these licences?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision goes further than just the television industry. It goes to the issue of the telecommunications competitor. I would have thought that those people who were responsible for making this decision in the Senate would have considered not only the implications to the television industry but also the broader impact on the communications sector generally. I do not believe it was appropriate for them to have referred this to a committee because of their predilection towards trying to mandate the ABC as a licence holder. That concerns me and I think it will concern the whole of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would pay if we were to go down this fairy path? Under this sort of scenario, is the Australian taxpayer expected to foot the bill for the ABC to be able to be the licensee? The Government has already indicated, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said at the time of the decision, that it is prepared to put up, and it has offered, $12 1/2m. We will be quite happy to see the ABC as part of some potential consortium down the track. We will be very happy if the ABC is able to sell its programs to people in the pay TV industry. But that is not good enough. For some reason or other, there is a view that we have to mandate a channel for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Why? What is the purpose? These are the people who were concerned about the view that the Government was playing favourites on pay television. I would have thought the quintessential double standard was being applied here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see those opposite pillorying the Government for their perception that there has been an unfair arrangement made by virtue of the announcement that we should have four channels and then another two and that for some unknown reason some unfair advantage has been given to one or other of the players. They have gone well beyond that, because apparently now they have said that it is their desire to ensure that the ABC is given a channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Parramatta said, what sort of advantage does that give not only the ABC but also those people who are involved with the ABC or potential consortium partners? We are not talking about just a public enterprise; we are talking about a gift to potential partners. The Opposition is saying, `We'll mandate the licence'&mdash;presumably it will set the fee&mdash;`and you'll get this licence for this fee. You arrange a consortium. Don't worry about competition. You just make up the consortium you want and go ahead'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one on this side of the chamber who does not strongly support the ABC. There is no-one on this side of the House who would not be prepared to publicly argue that the ABC provides the standard by which we should judge other broadcasters in this country. The bottom line is that the ABC belongs to the Australian public. It is not a commercial operation in the context of the other TV networks. It is funded by the public purse to in excess of half a billion dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already know that the Opposition, in its taxation package, is proposing cuts of $50m to the ABC's budget. If it is, on the one hand, to cut the amount of money which is made available out of the public purse and, on the other hand, to say that the ABC should be mandated as a licensee for a pay television licence, what does it intend to do about providing the ABC with sufficient resources to take out the licence and operate it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will presumably say that it would sell the services&mdash;after all, it is pay TV. Who is going to buy them? Why should the Parliament of Australia say to the public broadcaster, `We are going to give you a licence which ensures that you must sell your services to the public.'? Is there any logic in mandating that position? What sort of equity is involved in that sort of consideration? Who will benefit most from that sort of consideration? Who is the potential market for those services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the Opposition and the Democrats really believe that Mr and Mrs Average, who live in the western suburbs of Sydney, are going to canter out and purchase the services of six television channels&mdash;perhaps 24 channels, when we have CDV? Some people will, but I will bet my bottom dollar that it will not be Mr and Mrs Worker of this country. It might be the people who live on Sydney's North Shore, in Fannie Bay in Darwin or even in some places across the river in Melbourne. People who live in Peppermint Grove in Western Australia might buy them. Those people will have a disposable income sufficient to allow them to buy pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this plethora of services which the Opposition will give to the ABC and say, `You are going to have that service and you can go out and sell your service for the public good' does not stand up to proper examination. This says to me that the Opposition is prepared to suggest, as inevitably will happen under that scenario, that, because the ABC needs to compete with the other commercial operators who are providing pay TV on the 24-plus channels that will inevitably be here with CDV, it will divert its resources away from the free to air services and into pay television. It does not make a great deal of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some difficulties with the current pay TV proposals, at least in the short term&mdash;I am not worried about the longer term. My short term problem is simply that the technology will prohibit, in the first instance, the delivery of pay TV to very remote areas of Australia, which currently get the ABC and network television free to air. Is the Opposition saying that I am to tell the electors of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Far North Queensland, western New South Wales, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, or parts of South Australia, `Do not worry, it is okay. We will divert the resources that we are currently putting into the ABC so that the ABC can now provide pay TV for the people who live in Sydney and Melbourne.'? It will go down an absolute treat. People will be clamouring to buy shares in the ABC, once it is sold&mdash;I bet! They will be saying, `We do not want a bar of it. We do not believe it is appropriate. We want to maintain a very high standard of free to air services and for you to guarantee the standard of those free to air services to all Australians'.

It will also be very expensive, with set-up costs of the order of some hundreds of millions. It is very important that it gets done properly. It is inappropriate for the Opposition to be supporting this perverse attitude that seems to be running riot in the Senate at the moment. It is not for the good governance of this country, it is for the own petty political interests of Opposition senators.

<PARA>There are two amendments. One relates to what we did about the particular inquiries that were to be undertaken by the ABA into R-rated material. The Senate has moved away from our suggestion of a process of open public inquiry to one of research. It is a rather intriguing proposition from it, but I suppose even Senator Walters, Senator Harradine and others must have moments on the extreme Left on moral issues as well as occasions on the extreme Right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all been in politics long enough to find out that there are no real surprises in it for us. We must expect that, for some in political life, their convictions are essentially circular, which means that at some point in time they will be found on the spectrum with other people who see life in more linear terms. So it is that Senator Walters and Senator Harradine have come to uphold a fine 1960s civil libertarian left wing tradition. No doubt the ABA will be thorough in its private inquiries and the research it conducts on the subject of what we should do with R-certificate material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the amendments involve taking out that section of the legislation which relates to pay TV and sending it off to a committee and suggesting passage of the rest of the Bill.

It will be particularly costly for those who have hung around for some considerable time now trying to do the right thing by the ordinary punters in this country, who want access to pay TV.

Aggregate information is therefore not required for control purposes. To ensure that the estimate of the population is as complete as possible the ABS undertakes a Post Enumeration Survey.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes. In some instances injecting drug users are able to obtain free injecting equipment while diabetics are required to pay a contribution toward the cost of insulin syringes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prevention of HIV transmission through injecting drug use is a key component of the National HIV/ AIDS Strategy. Overseas experience has clearly demonstrated the potential for rapid and efficient transmission of the HIV virus among injecting drug users and from them to their partners and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the most effective strategy for preventing HIV infection amongst injecting drug users is obviously one that reduces the number of users, which is the Government's long term goal, it is also imperative that strategies are developed which minimise harm among existing drug users. The provision of clean injecting equipment for drug users and of facilities for safe disposal is therefore essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of such services is the responsibility of State and Territory governments. There are significant variations in the models of service provision, both between and within States. While some services, particularly those targeting drug users at highest risk of infection, are wholly free to clients, others impose charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of Australia's HIV prevention strategy for injecting drug users is reflected in our HIV infection rate for injecting drug users which, at about 1.5%, is one of the lowest of all developed countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By virtue of its status as a UN Specialized Agency, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) was recognised by the Specialized Agencies (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations of 1986 to be a "declared international </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">organization" to which the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 applied. Consequently, UNIDO and its high officers were granted various privileges and immunities in accordance with the terms of that Act and UNIDO was thereby effectively granted such privileges and immunities as were required under the 1947 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO on 31 December 1988, UNIDO's status as a Specialized Agency was consequently terminated by a 1989 amendment to the Specialized Agencies (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Australia's subsequent accession to UNIDO on 1 January 1992, UNIDO and its high officers are again entitled to those privileges and immunities which they had previously enjoyed before 1989 pursuant to the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 and the Specialized Agencies (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations of 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, new regulations amending the Specialized Agencies (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations of 1986, reinstating UNIDO's status as a Specialized Agency, are being drafted for approval by the Federal Executive Council. Upon gazettal of these regulations, UNIDO shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as Australia grants to all other UN Specialized Agencies (and which UNIDO had enjoyed before 1989).</PARA>
